# ICS Videos
This project is part of my thesis work. 
The primary goal of this system is to make video lectures more interactive by inserting automatically generated assessment items between video segments. 
The developed system takes a segmented video lecture and a textbook document on the related subject as input parameters. Then, the system generates the gap-fill questions from it in five stages: textbook segmentation, concept linking, sentence selection, key selection, and distractor selection.
