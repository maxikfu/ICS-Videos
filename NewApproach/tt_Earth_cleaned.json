In addition to these compositionally distinct layers, Earth is divided into layers based on physical properties. The physical properties used to define such zones include whether the layer is solid or liquid and how weak or strong it is.

Both share the word crust, but the similarity ends there. The oceanic crust is roughly 7 kilometers (4.5 miles) thick and composed of the dark igneous rock basalt. By contrast, the continental crust averages about 35 kilometers (22 miles) thick but may exceed about 70 kilometers (45 miles) in some mountainous regions such as the Rockies and Himalayas. Unlike the oceanic crust, which has a relatively homogeneous chemical composition, the continental crust consists of many rock types. Although the upper crust has an average composition of a granitic rock called granodiorite, it varies considerably from place to place. Continental rocks have an average density of about 2.7 g/cm3, and some have been discovered that are more than 4 billion years old. The rocks of the oceanic crust are younger (180 million years or less) and denser (about 3.0 g/cm3) than continental rocks. For comparison, liquid water has a density of 1 g/cm3; therefore, the density of basalt, the primary rock composing oceanic crust, is three times that of water."}

The dominant rock type in the uppermost mantle is peridotite, which contains minerals richer in the metals magnesium and iron compared to the minerals found in either the continental or oceanic crust."}
{"id": 9, "text": "The Upper Mantle The upper mantle extends from the crust\u2013mantle boundary down to a depth of about 660 kilometers (410 miles). The upper mantle can be divided into three different parts. The top portion of the upper mantle is part of the stronger lithosphere, and beneath that is the weaker asthenosphere. The bottom part of the upper mantle is called the transition zone. The lithosphere (\u201crock sphere\u201d) consists of the entire crust plus the uppermost mantle and forms Earth\u2019s relatively cool, rigid outer shell . Averaging about 100 kilometers (60 miles) thick, the lithosphere is more than 250 kilometers (155 miles) thick below the oldest portions of the continents. Beneath this stiff layer to a depth of about 410 kilometers (255 miles) lies a soft, comparatively weak layer known as the asthenosphere (\u201cweak sphere\u201d). The top portion of the asthenosphere has a temperature/pressure regime that results in a small amount of melting. Within this very weak zone, the lithosphere is mechanically detached from the layer below. The lithosphere thus is able to move independently of the asthenosphere, a fact we will consider in the next chapter. It is important to emphasize here that the strength of various Earth materials is a function of both their composition and the temperature and pressure of their environment. You should not get the idea that the entire lithosphere behaves like a rigid or brittle solid similar to rocks found on the surface. Rather, the rocks of the lithosphere get progressively hotter and weaker (more easily deformed) with increasing depth. At the depth of the uppermost asthenosphere, the rocks are close enough to their melting temperature (some melting may actually occur) that they are very easily deformed. Thus, the uppermost asthenosphere is weak because it is near its melting point, just as hot wax is weaker than cold wax. From about 410 kilometers (255 miles) to about 660 kilometers (410 miles) in depth is the part of the upper mantle called the transition zone . The top of the transition zone is identified by a sudden increase in density from about 3.5 to 3.7 g/cm3. This change occurs because minerals in the rock peridotite respond to the increase in pressure by forming new minerals with closely packed atomic structures."}

The average depth of the ocean floor is about 3.8 kilometers (2.4 miles) below sea level, or about 4.5 kilometers (2.8 miles) lower than the average elevation of the continents. The basaltic rocks that comprise the oceanic crust average only 7 kilometers (about 4.5 miles) thick and have an average density of about 3.0 g/cm3. r Continents. The continents are remarkably flat features that have the appearance of plateaus protruding above sea level. With an average elevation of about 0.8 kilometer (0.5 mile), continental blocks lie close to sea level, except for limited areas of mountainous terrain. Recall that the continents average about 35 kilometers (22 miles) thick and are composed of granitic rocks that have a density of about 2.7 g/cm3. The thicker, less dense continental crust is more buoyant than the oceanic crust. As a result, continental crust floats on top of the deformable rocks of the mantle at a higher level than oceanic crust for the same reason that a large, empty (less dense) cargo ship rides higher than a small, loaded (denser) one."}

During the past 65 years, oceanographers have used modern depth-sounding equipment and satellite technology to map significant portions of the ocean floor. These studies have led them to identify three major regions: continental margins, deep-ocean basins, and oceanic (mid-ocean) ridges."}
{"id": 20, "text": "Continental Margins The continental margin is the portion of the seafloor adjacent to major landmasses. It may include the continental shelf, the continental slope, and the continental rise. Although land and sea meet at the shoreline, this is not the boundary between the continents and the ocean basins. Rather, along most coasts, a gently sloping platform of material, called the continental shelf, extends seaward from the shore. Because it is underlain by continental crust, it is clearly a flooded extension of width of the continental shelf varies. For example, it is broad along the east and Gulf coasts of the United States but relatively narrow along the Pacific margin of the continent. The boundary between the continents and the deep-ocean basins lies along the continental slope, a relatively steep dropoff that extends from the outer edge of the continental shelf to the floor of the deep ocean . Using this as the dividing line, we find that about 60 percent of Earth\u2019s surface is represented by ocean basins and the remaining 40 percent by continents. In regions where trenches do not exist, the steep continental slope merges into a more gradual incline known as the continental rise, a thick wedge of sediment that moved downslope from the continental shelf and accumulated on the deep-ocean floor."}

Unlike most continental mountains that consist of highly deformed rock, the oceanic ridge system consists of layer upon layer of igneous rock that has been fractured and uplifted."}

Notice in that the young mountain belts tend to be long, narrow features at the margins of continents and that the flat, stable areas are typically located in the interiors of the continents. Mountain building is discussed in more detail in Chapter 14. \n\nMountain Belts The most prominent continental features are mountains. Although their distribution appears to be random, this is not the case. The youngest mountains (those less than 100 million years old) are located principally in two major zones. The circum-Pacific belt (the region surrounding the Pacific Ocean) includes the mountains of the western Americas and continues into the western Pacific in the form of volcanic island arcs . Island arcs are active mountainous regions composed largely of volcanic rocks and deformed sedimentary rocks. Examples include the Aleutian Islands, Japan, the Philippines, and New Guinea. The other major mountain belt extends eastward from the Alps through Iran and the Himalayas and then dips southward into Indonesia. Careful examination of mountainous terrains reveals that most are places where thick sequences of rocks have been squeezed and highly deformed, as if placed in a gigantic vise. Older mountains are also found on the continents. Examples include the Appalachians in the eastern United States and the Urals in Russia. Their once lofty peaks are now worn low, the result of millions of years of weathering and erosion.

Scientists later determined that a much better approximation of the outer boundary of a continent is the seaward edge of its continental shelf, which lies submerged a few hundred meters below sea level.

{"id": 34, "text": "Summarize the two main objections to the continental drift hypothesis. \n\nOne of the main objections to Wegener\u2019s hypothesis stemmed from his inability to identify a credible mechanism for continental drift. Wegener proposed that gravitational forces of the Moon and Sun that produce Earth\u2019s tides were also capable of gradually moving the continents across the globe. However, the prominent physicist Harold Jeffreys correctly argued that tidal forces strong enough to move Earth\u2019s continents would have resulted in halting our planet\u2019s rotation, which, of course, has not happened. Wegener also incorrectly suggested that the larger and sturdier continents broke through thinner oceanic crust, much as icebreakers cut through ice. However, no evidence existed to suggest that the ocean floor was weak enough to permit passage of the continents without the continents being appreciably deformed in the process. In 1930, Wegener made his fourth and final trip to the Greenland ice sheet . Although the primary focus of this expedition was to study this great ice cap and its climate, Wegener continued to test his continental drift hypothesis. While returning from Eismitte, an experimental station located in the center of Greenland, Wegener perished along with his Greenland companion. His intriguing idea, however, did not die. Why was Wegener unable to overturn the established scientific views of his day? Foremost was the fact that, although the central theme of Wegener\u2019s drift hypothesis was correct, some details were incorrect. For example, continents do not break through the ocean floor, and tidal energy is much too weak to move continents. Moreover, for any comprehensive scientific theory to gain wide acceptance, it must withstand critical testing from all areas of science. Despite Wegener\u2019s great contribution to our understanding of Earth, not all of the evidence supported the continental drift hypothesis as he had proposed it. Although many of Wegener\u2019s contemporaries opposed and even ridiculed his views, some considered his ideas plausible. For those geologists who continued the search, the exciting concept of continents adrift held their interest. Others viewed continental drift as a solution to previously unexplainable observations such as the cause of earthquakes. Nevertheless, most of the scientific community, particularly in North America, either categorically rejected continental drift or treated it with considerable skepticism."}

Further, the composition of both the oceanic and continental crusts affects their respective densities. Oceanic crust is composed of basalt, rich in dense iron and magnesium, whereas continental crust is composed largely of less dense granitic rocks. Because of these differences, the overall density of oceanic lithosphere (crust and upper mantle) is greater than the overall density of continental lithosphere. This important difference will be considered in greater detail later in this chapter. The asthenosphere (asthenos = weak) is a hotter, weaker region in the mantle that lies below the lithosphere . The temperatures and pressures in the upper asthenosphere (100 to 200 kilometers [60 to 125 miles] in depth) are such that rocks at this depth are very near their melting temperatures and, hence, respond to forces by flowing, similar to the way a thick liquid would flow. By contrast, the relatively cool and rigid lithosphere tends to respond to forces acting on it by bending or breaking but not flowing. Because of these differences, Earth\u2019s rigid outer shell is effectively detached from the asthenosphere, which allows these layers to move independently. \n\nArabian plate, are composed mostly of oceanic lithosphere.

Here, two adjacent plates move away from each other, producing long, narrow fractures in the ocean crust. As a result, hot molten rock from the mantle below migrates upward to fill the voids left as the crust is being ripped apart. This molten material gradually cools to produce new slivers of seafloor. In a slow yet unending manner, adjacent plates spread apart, and new oceanic lithosphere forms between them. For this reason, divergent plate boundaries are also called spreading centers."}

As shown in 2.11, various segments of the global ridge system have been named, including the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, East Pacific Rise, and Mid-Indian Ridge.

This structure is evidence that tensional (opposing) forces are actively pulling the ocean crust apart at the ridge crest.

But how does the subduction of a cool slab of oceanic lithosphere cause mantle rock to melt?

That is, \u201cwet\u201d rock in a high-pressure environment melts at substantially lower temperatures than does \u201cdry\u201d rock of the same Sediments and oceanic crust contain large amounts of water, which is carried to great depths by a subducting plate. As the plate plunges downward, heat and pressure drive water from the hydrated (water-rich) minerals in the subducting slab. At a depth of roughly 100 kilometers (60 miles), the wedge of mantle rock is sufficiently hot that the introduction of water from the slab below leads to some melting. This process, called partial melting, is thought to generate some molten material, which is mixed with unmelted mantle rock. Being less dense than the surrounding mantle, this hot mobile material gradually rises toward the surface. Depending on the environment, these mantle-derived masses of molten rock may ascend through the crust and give rise to a volcanic eruption. However, much of this material never reaches the surface but solidifies at depth\u2014a process that thickens the crust. The volcanoes of the towering Andes are the product of molten rock generated by the subduction of the Nazca plate beneath the South American continent (see ). Mountain systems like the Andes, which are produced in part by volcanic activity associated with the subduction of oceanic lithosphere, are called continental volcanic arcs.

Vine and Matthews reasoned that as magma solidifies along narrow rifts at the crest of an oceanic ridge, it is magnetized with the polarity of the existing magnetic field . Because of seafloor spreading, this strip of magnetized crust would gradually increase in width. When Earth\u2019s magnetic field reverses polarity, any newly formed seafloor having the opposite polarity would form in the middle of the old strip. Gradually, the two halves of the old strip would be carried in opposite directions, away from the ridge crest. Subsequent reversals would build a pattern of normal and reverse magnetic stripes, as shown in Because new rock is added in equal amounts to both trailing edges of the spreading ocean floor, we should expect the pattern of stripes (width and polarity) found on one side of an oceanic ridge to be a mirror image of those on the other side.

By knowing the age of a sample and its distance from the ridge axis where it was generated, an average rate of plate motion can be calculated. Scientists used these data, combined with their knowledge of paleomagnetism stored in hardened lavas on the ocean floor and seafloor topography, to create maps that show the age of the ocean floor. The reddishorange colored bands shown in range in age from the present to about 30 million years ago. The width of the bands indicates how much crust formed during that time period.

Therefore, the rate of seafloor spreading has been approximately three times faster in the Pacific basin than in the Atlantic. Maps of this type also provide clues to the current direction of plate movement. Notice the offsets in the ridges; these are transform faults that connect the spreading centers. Recall that transform faults are aligned parallel to the direction of spreading. When measured carefully, transform faults reveal the direction of plate movement. To establish the direction of plate motion in the past, geologists can examine the long fracture zones that extend for hundreds or even thousands of kilometers from ridge crests. Fracture zones are inactive extensions of transform faults and therefore preserve a record of past directions of plate motion.

{"id": 67, "text": "Geophysical evidence confirms that although the mantle consists almost entirely of solid rock, it is hot and weak enough to exhibit a slow, fluid-like convective flow. The simplest type of convection is analogous to heating a pot of water on a stove . Heating the base of a pot causes the water to become less dense (more buoyant), causing it to rise in relatively thin sheets or blobs that spread out at the surface. As the surface layer cools, its density increases, and the cooler water sinks back to the bottom of the pot, where it is reheated until it achieves enough buoyancy to rise again. Mantle convection is similar to, but considerably more complex than, the model just described. Geologists generally agree that subduction of cold, dense slabs of oceanic lithosphere is a major driving force of plate motion . This phenomenon, called slab pull, occurs because cold slabs of oceanic lithosphere are more dense than the underlying warm asthenosphere and hence \u201csink like a rock\u201d\u2014meaning that they are pulled down into the mantle by gravity. Another important driving force is ridge push (see ). This gravity-driven mechanism results from the elevated position of the oceanic ridge, which causes slabs of lithosphere to \u201cslide\u201d down the flanks of the ridge. Ridge push appears to contribute far less to plate motions than slab pull. The primary evidence for this is that the fastest-moving plates\u2014Pacific, Nazca, and Cocos plates\u2014have extensive subduction zones along their margins. By contrast, the spreading rate in the North Atlantic basin, which is nearly devoid of subduction zones, is one of the lowest, at about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) per year."}

Melting of these fragments is thought to be the source of magma for some of the volcanism that occurs away from plate boundaries, such as the hot-spot volcanism of Hawaii. In contrast to the active upper mantle, the lower mantle is sluggish and does not provide material to support volcanism at the surface. Very slow convection within this layer likely carries heat upward, but very little mixing between these two layers is thought to occur.

Thus, an ionic bond is the attraction of oppositely charged ions to one another, and it produces an electrically neutral ionic compound. chlorine ions in ordinary table salt. Notice that salt consists of alternating sodium and chlorine ions, positioned in such a manner that each positive ion is attracted to and surrounded on all sides by negative ions and vice versa. This arrangement maximizes the attraction between ions with opposite charges while minimizing the repulsion between ions with identical charges. Thus, ionic compounds consist of an orderly arrangement of oppositely charged ions assembled in a definite ratio that provides overall electrical neutrality. \n\nSometimes the forces that hold atoms together cannot be understood on the basis of the attraction of oppositely charged ions. One example is the hydrogen molecule tightly and no ions are present. The strong attractive force that holds two hydrogen atoms together results from a covalent bond, a chemical bond formed by the sharing of one or more valence electrons between a pair of atoms.

Worldwide, extensive evaporite deposits, some exceeding hundreds of meters in thickness, provide evidence of ancient seas that have long since evaporated (see page 100).

Considerable evidence supports the idea that the parent material for igneous rocks, called magma, is formed by partial melting that occurs at various levels within Earth\u2019s crust and upper mantle to depths of about 250 kilometers (about 150 miles). Once formed, a magma body buoyantly rises toward the surface because it is less dense than the surrounding rocks. (When rock melts, it takes up more space and, hence, it becomes less dense than the surrounding solid rock.) Occasionally, molten rock reaches Earth\u2019s surface, where it is called lava . Sometimes lava is emitted as fountains that are produced when escaping gases propel it from a magma chamber. On other occasions, lava is explosively ejected, producing dramatic steam and ash eruptions. However, not all eruptions are violent; many volcanoes emit quiet outpourings of fluid lava."}

These gases tend to separate from the melt as it moves toward the surface (from a high- to a low-pressure environment). As the gases build up, they may eventually propel magma from the vent.

{"id": 123, "text": "To better understand how magma crystallizes, let us consider how a simple crystalline solid melts. Recall that, in any crystalline solid, the ions are arranged in a closely packed regular pattern. However, they are not without some motion; they exhibit a restricted vibration about fixed points. As the temperature rises, ions vibrate more rapidly and consequently collide with ever-increasing vigor with their neighbors. Thus, heating causes the ions to occupy more space, which in turn causes the solid to expand. When the ions are vibrating rapidly enough to overcome the force of their chemical bonds, melting occurs. At this stage, the ions are able to slide past one another, and the orderly crystalline structure disintegrates. Thus, melting converts a solid consisting of tight, uniformly packed ions into a liquid composed of unordered ions moving randomly about. In the process called crystallization, cooling reverses the events of melting. As the temperature of the liquid drops, ions pack more closely together as their rate of movement slows. When they are cooled sufficiently, the forces of the chemical bonds will again confine the ions to an orderly crystalline arrangement. When a magma body cools, the silicon and oxygen atoms link together first to form silicon\u2013oxygen tetrahedra, the basic building blocks of the silicate minerals (see crystallize at depth or at Earth\u2019s surface."}
{"id": 124, "text": "page 92). As magma continues to lose heat to its surroundings, the tetrahedra join with each other and with other ions to form embryonic crystal nuclei. Slowly each nucleus grows as ions lose their mobility and join the crystalline network. The minerals that form the earliest have space to grow and tend to have better-developed crystal faces than do the ones that form later and occupy the remaining spaces. Eventually all of the melt is transformed into a solid mass of interlocking silicate minerals that we call an igneous rock . \n\nIgneous rocks form in two basic settings.

Because different minerals crystallize under different environmental conditions (temperatures and pressure), it is possible for crystals of one mineral to become quite large before others even begin to form. If molten rock containing some large crystals moves to a different environment\u2014for example, by erupting at the surface\u2014the remaining liquid portion of the lava cools more quickly. The resulting rock, which has large crystals embedded in a matrix of smaller crystals, is said to have a porphyritic texture . The large crystals in porphyritic rocks are referred to as phenocrysts (pheno 5 show, cryst 5 crystal), whereas the matrix of smaller crystals is called termed a porphyry. Vesicular Texture Common features of many extrusive rocks are the voids left by gas bubbles that escape as lava solidifies. These nearly spherical openings are called vesicles, and the rocks that contain them are said to have a vesicular texture. Rocks that exhibit a vesicular texture often form in the upper zone of a lava flow, where cooling occurs rapidly enough to preserve the openings produced by the expanding gas bubbles . Another common vesicular rock, called pumice, forms Glassy Texture During some volcanic eruptions, molten rock is ejected into the atmosphere, where it is quenched (very quickly cooled) to become a solid.

These structures, in turn, impede ionic transport and increase the magma\u2019s viscosity. (Viscosity is a measure of a fluid\u2019s resistance to flow.) So, granitic magma, which is rich in silica, may be extruded as an extremely viscous mass that eventually solidifies to form obsidian.

If melting continues, minerals with higher melting points begin to melt, and the composition of the melt steadily approaches the overall composition of the rock from which it was derived. Most often, however, melting is not complete. The incomplete melting of rocks is known as partial melting, a process that produces most magma. Recall from Bowen\u2019s reaction series that rocks with a granitic composition are composed of minerals with the lowest melting (crystallization) temperatures\u2014namely, quartz and potassium feldspar . Also note that as we move up Bowen\u2019s reaction series, the minerals have progressively higher melting temperatures and that olivine, which is found at the top, has the highest melting point. When a rock undergoes partial melting, it will form a melt that is enriched in ions from minerals with the lowest melting temperatures, while the unmelted portion is composed of minerals with higher melting temperatures . Separation of these two fractions yields a melt with a chemical composition that is richer in silica and nearer the felsic (granitic) end of the spectrum than the rock from which it formed. In general, partial melting of ultramafic rocks tends to yield mafic (basaltic) magmas, partial melting of mafic rocks generally yields intermediate (andesitic) magmas, and partial melting of intermediate rocks can generate felsic (granitic) magmas."}

Further evidence that many basaltic magmas have a mantle source are the inclusions of the rock peridotite, which basaltic magmas often carry up to Earth\u2019s surface from the mantle. Basaltic (mafic) magmas that originate from partial melting of mantle rocks are called primary or primitive magmas because they have not yet evolved. Recall that partial melting that produces mantle-derived magmas may be triggered by a reduction in confining pressure during the process of decompression melting. This can occur, for example, where hot mantle rock ascends as part of slow-moving convective flow at mid-ocean ridges . Basaltic magmas are also generated at subduction zones, where water driven from the descending slab of oceanic crust promotes partial melting of the mantle rocks that lie above ."}
{"id": 159, "text": "If partial melting of mantle rocks generates most basaltic magmas, what is the source of the magma that crystallizes to form andesitic (intermediate) and granitic (felsic) an intermediate rocks? Recall that silica-rich magmas erupt mainly along to felsic the continental margins. This is strong evidence that continental crust, which is thicker and has a lower density than oceanic crust, must play a role in generating these more highly evolved magmas. One way andesitic magma can form is when a rising mantle-derived basaltic magma undergoes magmatic differentiation as it slowly makes its way through the continental crust. Recall from our discussion of Bowen\u2019s reaction series that as basaltic magma solidifies, the An unmelted residue having silica-poor ferromagnesian minerals crystallize first. a mafic composition. If these iron-rich components are separated from the 4.8 Intrusive Igneous Activity liquid by crystal settling, the remaining melt will have an andesitic composition . Andesitic magmas can also form when rising basaltic magmas assimilate crustal rocks that tend to be silica rich. Partial melting of basaltic rocks is yet another way in which at least some andesitic magmas are thought to be produced. Although granitic magmas can be formed through magmatic differentiation of andesitic magmas, most granitic magmas probably form when hot basaltic magma ponds (becomes trapped because of its greater density) below continental crust . When the heat from the hot basaltic magma partially melts the overlying crustal rocks, which are silica rich and have a much lower melting temperature, the result can be the production of large quantities of granitic magmas. This process is thought to have been responsible for the volcanic activity in and around Yellowstone National Park in the distant past."}

Evidence supporting stoping is found in plutons that contain suspended blocks of country rock called xenoliths (xenos 5 a stranger, lithos 5 stone) .

However, many eruptions are not explosive. What determines the manner in which volcanoes erupt?"}
{"id": 166, "text": "The source material for volcanic eruptions is magma, molten rock that usually contains some solid crystalline material and varying amounts of dissolved gas. Erupted magma is called lava. The primary factors that affect the behavior of magma are its temperature and composition and, to a lesser extent, the amount of dissolved gases it contains. To varying degrees, these factors determine a magma\u2019s mobility, or viscosity (viscos = sticky). The more viscous the material, the greater its resistance to flow. For example, syrup is more viscous, and thus more resistant to flow, than water. \n\n50 percent silica, whereas magmas that produce felsic rocks (granite and its extrusive equivalent, rhyolite) contain more than 70 percent silica. Intermediate rock types\u2014andesite and diorite\u2014contain about 60 percent content: The more silica in magma, the greater its viscosity. Silica impedes the flow of magma because silicate structures begin to link together into long chains early in the crystallization process. Consequently, felsic (rhyolitic) lavas are very viscous and tend to form comparatively short, thick flows. By contrast, mafic (basaltic) lavas, which contain less silica, are relatively fluid and have been known to travel 300 kilometers (180 miles) or more before congealing."}
{"id": 167, "text": "Dissolved Gases The gaseous components in magma, mainly dissolved water vapor, also affect the mobility of magma. Other factors being equal, water vapor dissolved in magma tends to increase fluidity because it reduces formation of long silicate chains by breaking silicon\u2013oxygen bonds. It follows, therefore, that the loss of gases renders magma (lava) more viscous. Gases also give magmas their explosive character. \n\nYou learned in Chapter 4 that most magma is generated by partial melting of the rock peridotite in Earth\u2019s upper mantle, and it tends to have a basaltic composition. Newly formed basaltic magma, which is less dense than the surrounding rock, slowly rises toward the surface. In some settings, high-temperature basaltic magmas reach Earth\u2019s surface, where they produce highly fluid lavas. This most commonly occurs on the ocean floor, in association with seafloor spreading. In continental settings, however, the density of crustal rocks is less than that of the ascending material, causing the magma to pond at the crust\u2013mantle boundary. Heat from the hot magma is often sufficient to partially melt the overlying crustal rocks, generating a less-dense, silica-rich magma, which then continues the journey toward Earth\u2019s surface."}

The eruption of Kilauea that began in 1983 has been ongoing ever since. \n\nGases readily escape hot fluid basaltic flows, producing lava fountains.

At the other extreme, highly viscous magmas expel fragmented lava at nearly supersonic speeds, creating buoyant plumes consisting mainly of volcanic ash and gases called eruption columns. Eruption columns can rise perhaps 40 kilometers (25 miles) into the atmosphere. Therefore, volcanoes associated with highly viscous magmas are the most destructive to property and human life . Because silica-rich magmas are sticky (viscous), a significant portion of the gaseous materials remain dissolved until the magma nears Earth\u2019s surface, at which time tiny bubbles begin to form and grow. When the pressure exerted by the expanding magma body exceeds the strength of the overlying rock, fracturing occurs. As magma moves up the fractures, a further drop in confining pressure causes even more gas bubbles to form and grow. This chain reaction may generate an explosive event in which magma is literally blown into fragments (ash and pumice) that are carried to great heights by the hot gases. As exemplified by the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, the collapse of a volcano\u2019s flank can greatly reduce the pressure on the magma below, triggering an explosive eruption (see GEOgraphics 5.1)."}

These picturesque, conical mountains are produced by volcanic activity that occurred intermittently over thousands, or even hundreds of thousands, of years. However, many volcanoes do not fit this image. Cinder cones are quite small and form during a single eruptive phase that lasts a few days to a few years. Alaska\u2019s Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes is a flattopped ash deposit that blanketed a river valley to a depth of 200 meters (650 feet). This event lasted less than 60 hours yet emitted more than 20 times the volcanic material of the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption. Volcanic landforms come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes, and each volcano has a unique eruptive history. Nevertheless, volcanologists have been able to classify volcanic landforms and determine their eruptive patterns. In this section we will consider the general anatomy of an idealized volcanic cone. We will follow this discussion by exploring the three major types of volcanic cones\u2014shield volcanoes, cinder cones, and composite volcanoes\u2014as well as their associated hazards. Volcanic activity frequently begins when a fissure (crack) develops in Earth\u2019s crust as magma moves forcefully toward the surface. As the gas-rich magma moves up through a fissure, its path is usually localized into a somewhat circular conduit that terminates at a surface opening called a vent . The cone-shaped structure we call a volcanic cone is often created by successive eruptions of lava, pyroclastic material, or frequently a combination of both, often separated by long periods of inactivity. Located at the summit of most volcanic cones is a somewhat funnel-shaped depression, called a crater (crater = a bowl). Volcanoes built primarily of pyroclastic materials typically have craters that form by gradual accumulation of volcanic debris on the surrounding rim. Other craters form during explosive eruptions, as the rapidly ejected particles erode the crater walls. Craters also form when the summit area of a volcano collapses following an eruption. Some volcanoes have very large circular depressions, called calderas, that have diameters greater than 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) and in rare cases can exceed 50 kilometers (30 miles). The formation of various types of calderas will be considered later in this chapter. During early stages of growth, most volcanic discharges come from a central summit vent. As a volcano matures, material also tends to be emitted from fissures that develop along the flanks (sides) or at the base of the volcano. Continued activity from a flank eruption may produce one or more small parasitic cones (parasitus = one who eats at the table of another). Italy\u2019s Mount Etna, for example, has more than 200 secondary vents, some of which have built parasitic cones. Many of these vents, however, emit only gases and are appropriately called fumaroles (fumus = smoke)."}

As with Hawaii\u2019s other shield volcanoes, the flanks of Mauna Loa have gentle slopes of only a few degrees. This low angle is due to the very hot, fluid lava that traveled \u201cfast and far\u201d from the vent. In addition, most of the lava (perhaps 80 percent) flowed through a well-developed system of lava tubes. Another feature common to active shield volcanoes is one or more large, steep-walled calderas that occupy the summit (see page 164). Calderas on shield volcanoes usually form when the roof above the magma chamber collapses.

Further, Canary Islands volcanoes tend to eject more pyroclastic material than do Hawaiian eruptions. Despite their differences, most large oceanic shields have similar origins. They form above a long-lived, rising plume of hot mantle rock, called a mantle plume, described in more detail in Section 5.9. As the hot plume ascends through the mantle, the confining pressure drops, triggering partial melting and basaltic magma. This partial melting results in volcanic activity on the ocean floor, producing piles of pillow lavas that evolve into seamounts.

{"id": 191, "text": "Driven by Gravity Pyroclastic flows are propelled by the force of gravity and tend to move in a manner similar to snow avalanches.

These gases reduce friction between ash and pumice fragments, which gravity propels downslope in a nearly frictionless environment. This is why some pyroclastic flow deposits are found many miles from their source. Occasionally, powerful hot blasts that carry small amounts of ash separate from the main body of a pyroclastic flow. These low-density clouds, called surges, can be deadly but seldom have sufficient force to destroy buildings in their paths. Nevertheless, in 2014, a hot ash cloud from Japan\u2019s Mount Ontake killed 47 hikers and injured 69 more. Pyroclastic flows may originate in a variety of volcanic settings. Some occur when a powerful eruption blasts pyroclastic material out of the side of a volcano. More frequently, however, pyroclastic flows are generated by the collapse of tall eruption columns during an explosive event. When gravity eventually overcomes the initial upward thrust provided by the escaping gases, the ejected materials begin to fall, sending massive amounts of incandescent blocks, ash, and pumice cascading downslope."}

For centuries prior to this eruption, Vesuvius had been dormant, with vineyards adorning its sunny slopes. Yet in less than 24 hours, the entire city of Pompeii (near Naples) and a few thousand of its residents were entombed beneath a layer of volcanic ash and pumice. The city and the victims of the eruption remained buried for nearly 17 centuries. The excavation of Pompeii gave archaeologists a superb By reconciling historic records with detailed scientific studies of the region, volcanologists reconstructed the sequence of events. During the first day of the eruption, a rain of ash and pumice accumulated at a rate of 12 to 15 centimeters (5 to 6 inches) per hour, causing most of the roofs in Pompeii to eventually give way. Then, suddenly, a surge of searing hot ash and gas swept rapidly down the flanks of Vesuvius. This deadly pyroclastic flow killed those who had somehow managed to survive the initial ash and pumice fall. Their remains were quickly buried by falling ash, and subsequent rainfall caused the ash to harden. Over the centuries, the remains decomposed, creating cavities that were discovered by nineteenth-century excavators. Casts were then produced by pouring plaster of Paris into than two dozen explosive eruptions since c.e. 79, the most recent occurring in 1944. Today, Vesuvius towers over the Naples skyline, a region occupied by roughly 3 million people. Such an image should prompt us to consider how volcanic crises might be managed in the future."}

Most active volcanoes on land are located along the margins of the ocean basins\u2014notably within the circum-Pacific belt known as the Ring of Fire . These volcanoes consist mainly of composite cones that emit volatile-rich magma that has an andesitic (intermediate) composition and occasionally produce awe-inspiring eruptions. Another group of volcanoes includes the innumerable seamounts that form along the crest of the mid-ocean ridges. At these depths (1 to 3 kilometers below sea level), the pressures are so intense that the gases emitted quickly dissolve in the seawater and never reach the surface. There are some volcanic structures, however, that appear to be somewhat randomly distributed around the globe. These volcanic structures comprise most of the islands of the deep-ocean basins, including the Hawaiian Islands, the Galapagos Islands, and Easter Island. Prior to the development of the theory of plate tectonics, geologists did not have an acceptable explanation for the distribution of Earth\u2019s volcanoes. Recall that most magma originates in rocks from Earth\u2019s upper mantle that is essentially solid, not molten. The basic connection between plate tectonics and volcanism is that plate motions provide the mechanisms by which mantle rocks undergo partial melting to generate magma."}
{"id": 209, "text": "Recall from the previous chapter that along certain convergent plate boundaries, two plates move toward each other, and a slab of oceanic lithosphere descends into the mantle, generating a deep-ocean trench. As the slab sinks deeper into the mantle, the increases in temperature and pressure drive water and carbon dioxide from the subducting oceanic crust. These mobile fluids migrate upward and reduce the melting point of hot mantle rock sufficiently to trigger some a basaltic composition. After a sufficient quantity of the rock has melted, blobs of buoyant magma slowly migrate upward. Volcanism at a convergent plate margin results in the development of a slightly curved chain of volcanoes called a volcanic arc. These volcanic chains develop roughly parallel to the associated trench\u2014at distances of 200 to 300 kilometers (120 to 180 miles). Volcanic arcs can be constructed on oceanic as well as continental lithosphere. Those that develop within the ocean and grow large enough for their tops to rise above the surface are labeled archipelagos in most atlases.

Hence, a mantle-derived magma changes chemically as it rises by assimilating silica-rich crustal rocks. At the same time, extensive magmatic differentiation occurs. (Recall from Chapter 4 that magmatic differentiation is the formation of secondary magmas from parent magma.) Stated another way, the magma generated in the mantle may change from a fluid basaltic magma to a silica-rich andesitic or rhyolitic magma as it moves up through the continental crust. The Ring of Fire, a belt of explosive volcanoes, surrounds the Pacific basin where oceanic lithosphere is being subducted beneath most of the landmasses that surround the Pacific Ocean .

Partial melting of mantle rock at spreading centers produces basaltic magma. Because this newly formed magma is less dense than the mantle rock from which it was derived, it rises and collects in reservoirs located just below the ridge crest. This activity continuously adds new basaltic rock to plate margins, temporarily welding them together, only to have them break again as spreading continues. Along some ridge segments, outpourings of pillow lavas build numerous volcanic structures, the largest of which is Iceland.

These masses of ice grow larger because they are supplied with water migrating from unfrozen areas as thin liquid films. As more water accumulates and freezes, the soil is heaved and pore spaces of rocks. Lenses of ice grow larger as they attract liquid water from surrounding pores. The growth of these ice masses gradually weakens the rock, causing it to fracture."}

It begins when sea spray from breaking waves or salty groundwater penetrates crevices and pore spaces in rock. As this water evaporates, salt crystals form. As these crystals gradually grow larger, they weaken the rock by pushing apart the surrounding grains or enlarging tiny cracks. This same process can also contribute to the crumbling of roadways where salt is spread to melt snow and ice in winter.

{"id": 224, "text": "Discuss the role of water in each of three chemical weathering processes. \n\nIn the preceding discussion of mechanical weathering, you learned that breaking rock into smaller pieces aids chemical weathering by increasing the surface area available for chemical attack. It should also be pointed out that chemical weathering contributes to mechanical weathering by weakening the outer portions of some rocks, which, in turn, makes them more susceptible to being broken by mechanical weathering processes. Chemical weathering involves the complex processes that break down rock components and internal structures of minerals. Such processes convert the constituents to new minerals or release them to the surrounding environment. During this transformation, the original rock decomposes into substances that are stable in the surface environment. Consequently, the products of chemical weathering will remain essentially unchanged as long as they remain in an environment similar to the one in which they formed. Water is by far the most important agent of chemical weathering. Pure water alone is a good solvent, and small amounts of dissolved materials result in increased chemical activity for weathering solutions. The major processes of chemical weathering are dissolution, oxidation, and hydrolysis. Water plays a leading role in each."}
{"id": 225, "text": "Perhaps the easiest type of decomposition to envision is the process of dissolution. Just as sugar dissolves in water, so too do certain minerals. One of the most water-soluble minerals is halite (common salt), which, as you may recall, is composed of sodium and chloride ions. Halite readily dissolves in water because, although this compound maintains overall electrical neutrality, the individual ions retain their respective charges. Moreover, the surrounding water molecules are polar\u2014that is, the oxygen end of the molecule has a small residual negative charge; the hydrogen end has a small positive charge. As the water molecules come in contact with halite, their negative ends approach sodium ions, and their positive ends cluster about chloride ions. This disrupts the attractive forces in the halite crystal and releases the ions to the water solution . Although most minerals are, for all practical purposes, insoluble in pure water, the presence of even a small amount of acid dramatically increases the corrosive force of water\u2014thus causing dissolution. (An acidic nature, acids are produced by a number of processes. For example, carbonic acid is created when carbon dioxide in the atmosphere dissolves in raindrops. As acidic rainwater soaks into the ground, carbon dioxide in the soil may increase the acidity of the weathering solution. Various organic acids are also released into the soil as organisms 6.3 Chemical Weathering Water molecules are polar because both hydrogen atoms bond to the same side of an oxygen atom. Thus, the hydrogen side of the molecule is slightly positive, and the oxygen side is slightly negative."}

{"id": 237, "text": "The source of the weathered mineral matter from which soils develop is called the parent material and is a major factor influencing newly forming soil. Gradually this weathered matter undergoes physical and chemical changes as soil formation progresses. Parent material can either be the underlying bedrock or a layer of unconsolidated deposits. When the parent material is bedrock, the soils are termed residual soils, while soils developed on unconsolidated sediment are called transported soils . It should be pointed out that transported soils form in place on parent materials that have been carried from elsewhere and deposited by gravity, water, wind, or ice. Parent material influences soils in two ways. First, the type of parent material influences the rate of weathering and thus the rate of soil formation. Also, because unconsolidated deposits are already partly weathered, soil development on such material will likely progress more rapidly than when bedrock is the parent material. Second, the chemical makeup of the parent material will affect the soil\u2019s fertility. This influences the character of the natural vegetation the soil can support. At one time, the parent material was thought to be the primary factor causing differences among soils. \n\nHowever, soil scientists have come to understand that other factors, especially climate, are more important. In fact, similar soils often develop from different parent materials, and dissimilar soils can develop from the same parent material. Such discoveries reinforce the importance of other soil-forming factors."}

Also, the amount of precipitation influences the degree to which various materials are removed from the soil by percolating water (a process called leaching), thereby affecting soil fertility.

Further, because of accelerated erosion on steep slopes, the soils are thin or in some cases nonexistent . In contrast, poorly drained and waterlogged soils found in bottomlands have a much different character. Such soils are usually thick and dark.

Despite their role in providing food, fiber, and other basic materials, soils are among our most abused resources."}
{"id": 252, "text": "Over the past few decades, the destruction of tropical forests has become a serious environmental issue. Each year millions of acres are cleared for agriculture and logging . This clearing results in soil degradation, loss of biodiversity, and climate change. Thick red-orange soils (oxisols) are common in the wet tropics and subtropics . They are the end product of extreme chemical weathering. Because lush tropical rain forests are associated with these soils, many people assume that they are fertile and have great potential for agriculture. However, just the opposite is true: Oxisols are among the poorest soils for farming. How can this be? Rain forest soils develop under conditions of high temperature and heavy rainfall and are therefore severely leached. Not only does leaching remove the soluble materials such as calcium carbonate, but the great quantities of percolating rainwater also remove much of the silica, and as a result, insoluble oxides of iron and aluminum become concentrated in the soil. Iron oxides give the soil its distinctive color. Because bacterial activity is high in the wet tropics, organic matter quickly breaks down, and rain forest soils contain very little humus. Moreover, leaching destroys fertility because most plant nutrients in the soil are removed by the large volume of downwardpercolating water. Despite the dense and luxuriant rain forest vegetation, the soil itself contains few available Most nutrients that support the rain forest are locked up in the trees themselves. As vegetation dies and decomposes, the roots of the rain forest trees quickly absorb the nutrients before they are leached from the soil. The nutrients are continuously recycled as trees die and decompose. Therefore, when forests are cleared to provide land for farming or to harvest timber, most of the nutrients are removed as well. What remains is a soil that contains little to nourish planted crops. Rain forest clearing not only removes plant nutrients but also accelerates soil erosion. The roots of rain forest vegetation anchor the soil, and leaves and branches provide a canopy that protects the ground by deflecting the full force of the frequent heavy rains. When the protective vegetation is gone, soil erosion increases. \n\nThe removal of vegetation also exposes the ground to strong direct sunlight. When baked by the Sun, these tropical soils can harden to a bricklike consistency and become practically impenetrable to water and crop roots. In just a few years, a freshly cleared area may no longer be cultivable."}

Soil erosion is a natural process; it is part of the constant recycling of Earth materials that we call the rock cycle. Once soil forms, erosional forces, especially water and wind, move soil components from one place to another. Every time it rains, raindrops strike the land with surprising force . Each drop acts like a tiny bomb, blasting movable soil particles out of their positions in the soil mass. Then, water flowing across the surface carries away the dislodged soil particles. Because the soil is moved by thin sheets of water, this process is termed sheet erosion. After the water flows as a thin, unconfined sheet for a relatively short distance, threads of current typically develop, and tiny channels called rills begin to form. Still deeper cuts in the soil, known as gullies, are created as rills enlarge . When normal farm cultivation cannot eliminate the channels, we know the rills have grown large enough to be called gullies. Although most dislodged soil particles move only a short distance during each rainfall, substantial quantities eventually leave the fields and make their way downslope to a stream.

This is illustrated nicely in the Grand Canyon, where the gentler slopes of weathered shale are quite inconspicuous and overgrown with vegetation, in sharp contrast with the bold cliffs produced by more durable rocks . Although shale beds may not form striking cliffs and prominent outcrops, some deposits have economic value. Certain shales are quarried to obtain raw material for pottery, brick, tile, and china.

Knowing this information allows us to infer that a well-sorted, quartzrich sandstone consisting of highly rounded grains must be the result of a great deal of transport.

We may also conclude that a sandstone containing significant amounts of feldspar and angular grains of ferromagnesian minerals underwent little chemical is the predominant mineral in most sandstones. Such rock is often simply called quartz sandstone (see 7.6). When a sandstone contains appreciable quantities of feldspar (25 percent or more), the rock is called arkose.

Because large particles abrade and become rounded very rapidly during transport, the pebbles and cobbles in a breccia indicate that they did not travel far from their source area before they were deposited. Thus, as with many other sedimentary rocks, conglomerates and breccias contain clues to their history. Their particle sizes reveal the strength of the currents that transported them, whereas the degree of rounding indicates how far the particles traveled.

However, one easily identified biochemical limestone is coquina, a coarse rock composed of poorly cemented shells and shell fragments . Another less obvious but nevertheless familiar example is chalk, a soft, porous rock made up almost entirely of the hard parts of microscopic marine organisms. Among the most famous chalk deposits are those exposed along the southeast coast of England . Inorganic Limestones Limestones having an inorganic origin form when chemical changes or high water temperatures increase the water\u2019s concentration of calcium carbonate to the point that it precipitates. Travertine, the type of limestone commonly seen in caves, is an example . When travertine is deposited in caves, groundwater is the source of the calcium carbonate. As water droplets become exposed to the air in a cavern, some of the carbon dioxide dissolved in the water escapes, causing calcium carbonate to precipitate. Another variety of inorganic limestone is oolitic limestone, a rock composed of small spherical grains called ooids. Ooids form in shallow marine waters as tiny \u201cseed\u201d particles (commonly small shell fragments) are moved back and forth with currents.

Although dolostone and limestone sometimes closely resemble one another, they can be easily distinguished by observing their reaction to dilute hydrochloric acid.

It appears that significant quantities of dolostone are produced when magnesium-rich waters circulate through limestone and convert calcite to dolomite when some calcium ions are replaced by magnesium ions (a process called dolomitization). However, not all dolostones appear to be formed by such a process, and their origin remains uncertain."}

They form when silica, originally deposited in one place, dissolves, migrates, and then chemically precipitates elsewhere, replacing older material."}
{"id": 277, "text": "In the geologic past, many areas that are now dry land were basins, submerged under shallow arms of a sea that had only narrow connections to the open ocean. Under these conditions, seawater continually moved into the bay to replace water lost by evaporation. Eventually the waters of the bay became saturated, and salt deposition began. Such deposits are called evaporites. Minerals commonly precipitated in this fashion include halite (sodium chloride, NaCl), which is the importance. Halite is familiar to everyone as the common salt used in cooking and seasoning foods. Of course it has many other uses, from melting ice on roads to making hydrochloric acid, and it has been considered important enough that people have sought, traded, and fought over it for much of human history. Gypsum is the basic ingredient in plaster of Paris. This material is used most extensively in the construction industry for wallboard (drywall) and interior plaster. When a body of seawater evaporates, the minerals that precipitate do so in a sequence that is determined by their solubility. Less soluble minerals precipitate first, and more soluble minerals precipitate later, as salinity increases. For example, gypsum precipitates when about 80 percent of the seawater has evaporated, and halite crystallizes when 90 percent of the water has been removed. During the last stages of this process, potassium and magnesium salts precipitate. One of these last-formed salts, the mineral sylvite, is mined as a significant source of potassium (\u201cpotash\u201d) for fertilizer. On a smaller scale, evaporite deposits can be seen in such places as Death Valley, California, and Utah\u2019s Bonneville Salt Flats.

{"id": 279, "text": "Outline the successive stages in the formation of coal. \n\nCoal is different from other sedimentary rocks. Unlike limestone and chert, which are calcite and silica rich, coal is made of organic matter. Close examination of coal under a magnifying glass often reveals plant structures such as leaves, bark, and wood that have been chemically altered but are still identifiable. This supports the conclusion that coal is the end product of large amounts of plant material, buried for millions of years . The formation of coal involves these stages: 1. Accumulation of plant remains. The initial stage in coal formation is the accumulation of large quantities of plant remains. Such accumulations result from special conditions because dead plants readily decompose when exposed to the atmosphere or other oxygen-rich environments. One important environment that allows for the buildup of plant material is a swamp. Stagnant swamp water is oxygen deficient, so complete decay (oxidation) of the plant material is not possible. Instead, the plants are attacked by certain bacteria that partly decompose the organic material and liberate oxygen and hydrogen. As these elements escape, the percentage of carbon in the plant matter gradually increases. The bacteria are not able to finish the job of decomposition because their growth is impeded by acids liberated from the plants. 2. Formation of peat and lignite. The partial decomposition of plant remains in an oxygen-poor swamp creates a layer of peat, a soft brown material in which plant structures are still easily recognized. With shallow burial, peat slowly changes to lignite, a soft brown coal. Burial increases the temperature of sediments as well as the pressure on them. 3. Formation of bituminous coal. The higher temperatures bring about chemical reactions within the plant materials and yield water and organic gases (volatiles). As the load increases from more sediment on top of the developing coal, the water and volatiles are pressed out, and the proportion of fixed carbon (the remaining solid combustible material) increases. The greater the carbon content, the greater the coal\u2019s energy ranking as a fuel. During burial, the coal also becomes increasingly compact. For example, deeper burial transforms lignite into a harder, more compacted black rock called bituminous coal."}
{"id": 280, "text": "4. Formation of anthracite coal. Lignite and bituminous coals are sedimentary rocks. However, when sedimentary layers are subjected to the folding and deformation associated with mountain building, the heat and pressure cause a further loss of volatiles and water, thus increasing the concentration of fixed carbon. This metamorphoses bituminous coal into anthracite, a very hard, shiny, black metamorphic rock (see Chapter 8). Although anthracite is a cleanburning fuel, only a relatively small amount is mined. Anthracite is not widespread and is more difficult and expensive to extract than the relatively flat-lying layers of bituminous coal."}

The term diagenesis (dia = change, genesis = origin) is a collective term for all the chemical, physical, and biological changes that take place after sediments are deposited and during and after lithification. \n\nupper few kilometers of Earth\u2019s crust at temperatures threshold, metamorphism is said to occur. One example of diagenetic change is recrystallization, the development of more stable minerals from less stable ones. For example, the mineral aragonite is the less stable form of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). Aragonite is secreted by many marine organisms to form shells and other hard parts, such as the skeletal structures produced by corals. In some environments, large quantities of these solid materials accumulate as sediment. As burial takes place, aragonite recrystallizes to the more stable form of calcium carbonate, calcite, the main constituent in the sedimentary rock Another example of diagenesis is provided in the preceding discussion of coal. It involves the chemical alteration of organic matter in an oxygen-poor environment. Instead of completely decaying, as would occur in the presence of oxygen, the organic matter is slowly transformed into solid carbon."}

{"id": 283, "text": "Compaction The most common physical diagenetic change is compaction. As described earlier, as sediment accumulates, the weight of overlying material compresses the deeper sediments. The deeper a sediment is buried, the more it is compacted and the firmer it becomes. As the grains are pressed closer and closer, there is considerable reduction in pore space. For example, when clays are buried beneath several thousand meters of material, the volume of the clay layer may be reduced by as much as 40 percent. As pore space decreases, much of the water that was trapped in the sediments is driven out. Because sands and other coarse sediments are less compressible, compaction is most significant as a lithification process in fine-grained sedimentary rocks like shale."}
{"id": 284, "text": "An orange or dark-red color in a sedimentary rock means that iron oxide is present. Most sedimentary rocks are lithified by means of compaction and/or cementation. However, some, like the evaporites, initially form as solid masses of intergrown crystals rather than beginning as accumulations of separate particles that later become solid. Other crystalline sedimentary rocks do not begin that way but are transformed into masses of interlocking crystals sometime after the sediment is deposited. For example, with time and burial, loose sediment consisting of delicate calcium carbonate\u2013rich skeletal debris may be recrystallized into a relatively dense crystalline limestone. Because crystals grow until they fill all the available space, crystalline sedimentary rocks often lack pore spaces. Unless the rocks later develop joints and fractures, they will be relatively impermeable to fluids such as water and oil."}

By understanding the conditions under which sedimentary rocks form, geologists can often deduce the history of a rock, including information about the origin of its component particles, the method of sediment transport, and the nature of the place where the grains eventually came to rest\u2014that is, the environment of deposition. An environment of deposition, or sedimentary environment, is a geographic setting where sediment is accumulating. Each site is characterized by a particular combination of geologic processes and environmental conditions. Some sediments, such as the chemical sediments that precipitate in water bodies, are solely products of their sedimentary environment. That is, their component minerals originated and were deposited in the same place. Other sediments originate far from the site where they accumulate. These materials are transported great distances from their source by some combination of gravity, water, wind, and ice. At any given time, the geographic setting and environmental conditions of a sedimentary environment determine the nature of the sediments that accumulate. Geologists carefully study the sediments in present-day depositional environments because the features they find can also be observed in ancient sedimentary rocks. Geologists apply a thorough knowledge of presentday conditions to reconstruct the ancient environments and geographic relationships of an area at the time a particular set of sedimentary layers were deposited. This process is an excellent example of applying a fundamental principle of modern geology: \u201cThe present is the key to the past.\u201d* Such analyses often lead to the creation of maps depicting the past geographic distribution of land and sea, mountains and river valleys, deserts and glaciers, and other environments of deposition."}

In some cold regions, moving masses of glacial ice replace running water as the dominant process. In arid regions (as well as some coastal settings), wind takes on greater importance. Clearly, the nature of the sediments deposited in continental environments is strongly influenced by climate. Streams are the dominant agent of landscape alteration, eroding more land and transporting and depositing more sediment than any other process. In addition to channel deposits, large quantities of sediment are dropped when floodwaters periodically inundate broad, flat valley floors (called floodplains). Where rapid streams emerge from a mountainous area onto a flatter surface, a distinctive cone-shaped accumulation of sediment known as an alluvial fan forms. In frigid, high-latitude or high-altitude settings, glaciers pick up and transport huge volumes of sediment. Materials deposited directly from ice are typically unsorted mixtures of particles that range in size from fine clay to huge boulders. Water from melting glaciers transports and redeposits some of this glacial sediment, creating stratified, sorted accumulations."}

Where winds are strong and the surface is not anchored by vegetation, sand is transported closer to the ground, where it accumulates in dunes. Deserts and coasts are common sites for this type of deposition. In addition to being areas where dunes sometimes develop, desert basins are sites where shallow playa lakes occasionally form following heavy rains or periods of snowmelt in adjacent mountains. They rapidly dry up, sometimes leaving behind evaporites and other characteristic deposits. s 19.9 and 19.10 on page 581 illustrate such an environment.

The kind of sediment deposited here depends on several factors, including distance from shore, elevation of the adjacent land area, water depth, water temperature, and climate. Due to the ongoing erosion of the adjacent continent, the shallow marine environment receives huge quantities of land-derived sediment. Where the influx of such sediment is small and the seas are relatively warm, carbonate-rich muds may be the predominant sediment. Most of this material consists of the skeletal debris of carbonate-secreting organisms mixed with inorganic precipitates. Coral reefs are also associated with warm, shallow marine environments. In hot regions where the sea occupies a basin with restricted circulation, evaporation triggers the precipitation of soluble materials and the formation of marine evaporite deposits. Deep marine environments include all the floors of the deep ocean. Far from landmasses, tiny particles from many sources remain adrift for long spans. Gradually these small grains \u201crain\u201d down on the ocean floor, where they accumulate very slowly.

The quieter waters in these sheltered areas are another site of deposition in the transition zone. Deltas are among the most significant deposits associated with transitional environments. The complex accumulations of sediment build outward into the sea when rivers experience an abrupt loss of velocity and deposit their load of detrital material."}
{"id": 294, "text": "When we study a series of sedimentary layers, we can see the successive changes in environmental conditions that occurred at a particular place with the passage of time. Changes in past environments may also be seen when a single layer of sedimentary rock is traced laterally. This is true because at any one time, many different depositional environments can exist over a broad area. For example, when sand is accumulating in a beach environment, finer muds are often being deposited in quieter offshore waters. Still farther out, perhaps in a zone where biological activity is high and land-derived sediments are scarce, the deposits consist largely of the calcite-rich remains of small organisms. In this example, different sediments are accumulating adjacent to one another at the same time. Different parts of each layer possess a distinctive set of characteristics that reflect the conditions in a particular environment. The term facies is used to describe such sets of sediments. When a sedimentary layer is examined in cross section from one end to the other, each facies grades laterally into another that formed at the same time but that exhibits different characteristics . The merging of adjacent facies tends to be a gradual transition rather than a sharp boundary, but abrupt changes do sometimes occur."}

Graded beds are most characteristic of rapid deposition from water containing sediment of varying sizes. When a current experiences a rapid energy loss, the largest particles settle first, followed by successively smaller grains. The deposition of a graded bed is most often associated with a turbidity current, a mass of sediment-choked water that is denser than clear water and that moves downslope along the bottom of a lake or an ocean . As geologists examine sedimentary rocks, they can indicate a high-energy environment such as a surf zone or rushing stream, where only coarse materials remain and finer particles are kept suspended. An arkose may signify a dry climate, where little chemical alteration of feldspar is possible. Carbonaceous shale is a sign of a low-energy, organic-rich environment, such as a swamp or lagoon.

Ripple marks are small waves of sand that develop on the surface of a sediment layer through ridges form at right angles to the direction of motion. If the ripple marks were formed by air or water moving in essentially one direction, their form will be asymmetrical.

When present in solid rock, they may be used to determine the direction of movement of ancient wind or water currents. Other ripple marks have a symmetrical form. These features, called oscillation ripple marks, result from the back-and-forth movement of surface waves in a shallow near-shore environment. and dry.

As described earlier, clay minerals tend to become unstable when buried to a depth of about 8 kilometers (5 clay minerals begin to recrystallize into new minerals, such as chlorite and muscovite, both of which are stable in this new environment. However, many silicate minerals, particularly those found in crystalline igneous rocks\u2014 such as quartz and feldspar\u2014remain stable at these temperatures. Thus, metamorphic changes in quartz and feldspar generally occur at higher temperatures. provides several examples of conditions in which heat drives metamorphism. Environments where rocks may be carried to great depths and heated include convergent plate boundaries where slabs of sedimentladen oceanic crust are being subducted. Rocks may also become deeply buried in large basins where gradual subsidence results in thick accumulations of sediment. These basins, exemplified by the Gulf of Mexico, are known to develop low-grade metamorphic conditions near the base of the pile. In addition, continental collisions, which result in mountain building, cause some rocks to be uplifted while others are thrust downward, where elevated temperatures and pressures trigger metamorphism. Heat may also be transported from the mantle into the shallowest layers of the crust. Rising mantle plumes, upwelling at mid-ocean ridges, and magma generated by partial melting of mantle rock at subduction zones are three such examples . When magma intrudes rocks at shallow depths, the magma cools and releases heat, which \u201cbakes\u201d the surrounding host rock."}

In addition, many minerals, including clays, micas, and amphiboles, are hydrated\u2014 which means they contain water in their crystalline structures. Elevated temperatures and pressures cause these minerals to dehydrate, expelling hot, mineralladen water. \n\nMost metamorphic rocks have the same overall chemical composition as the parent rocks from which they formed, except for the possible loss or acquisition parent material metamorphic rocks were derived, the most important clue comes from their overall chemical Consider the large exposures of the metamorphic rock marble found high in the Alps of Southern Europe. Because marble and the common sedimentary rock limestone have the same mineralogy (calcite), it seems reasonable to conclude that limestone is the parent rock of marble. Furthermore, because limestone usually forms in warm, shallow marine environments, we can surmise that considerable deformation must have occurred to convert limy deposits in a shallow sea into marble crags in the lofty Alps. The mineral makeup of the parent rock also largely determines the degree to which each metamorphic agent will cause change. For example, when magma forces its way into an existing body of rock, high temperatures and hot fluids may alter the host rock. If the host rock is composed of minerals that are comparatively nonreactive, such as quartz, any alterations that may occur will be confined to a narrow zone next to the igneous intrusion. However, when the host rock is limestone, which is highly reactive, the zone of metamorphism may extend far from the intrusion."}

Although foliation may occur in some sedimentary and even a few types of igneous rocks, it is a fundamental characteristic of metamorphosed rocks that have been strongly deformed, mainly by folding. In metamorphic environments, foliation is ultimately driven by compressional stress that shortens rock units, causing mineral grains in preexisting rocks to develop parallel, or nearly parallel, alignments. Examples of foliation include the parallel alignment of platy minerals through rotation, recrystallization, and flattening of mineral grains or pebbles. Foliated textures include rock cleavage in which rocks can be easily split into tabular slabs, and compositional banding in which the separation of dark and light minerals generates a layered appearance. These diverse types of foliation can form in many different ways."}

The shape of a mineral may also be altered by a process in which individual atoms move from a location along the margin of the grain that is highly stressed to a less-stressed position on the same grain . This mechanism, called pressure solution, is significantly aided by hot, ion-rich water. Mineral matter (ions) dissolves where grains are in contact with each other (areas of high stress) and is deposited in pore spaces (areas of low stress). As a result, the mineral grains tend to become shortened in the direction of maximum stress and elongated in the direction of minimum stress. While both of these mechanisms flatten mineral grains, the mineralogy remains the same."}
{"id": 312, "text": "Various types of foliation exist, depending largely upon the grade of metamorphism and the mineralogy of the parent rock.

When these platy minerals are large enough to be discernible with the unaided eye, they exhibit planar or layered structures called schistosity. Rocks that have this type of foliation are referred to as schist. In addition to containing platy minerals, schist often contains deformed quartz and feldspar crystals that appear flattened or lens-shaped and are embedded among the mica grains. \n\nDevelopment of gneissic banding Gneissic banding develops through the migration of ions that cause felsic and mafic minerals to grow in separate layers. \n\nIon migration causes light and dark minerals to separate. \n\nParent rock with randomly oriented mineral grains. \n\nGarnet\u2013mica schist The dark red garnet crystals (porphyroblasts) are embedded in a matrix of fine-grained large, intergrown calcite crystals, similar in appearance to those in coarse-grained igneous rocks.

Porphyroblastic textures develop in a Dennis Tasa wide range of rock types and Gneissic texture metamorphic environments when minerals in the parent rock recrystallize to form new minerals. During recrystallization, certain metamorphic minerals, such as garnet, tend to develop a small number of very large crystals.

Most metamorphic rocks that we observe at Earth\u2019s surface were derived from the three most common sedimentary rocks\u2014shale, limestone, and quartz sandstone. Shale is the most likely parent of most slate, phyllite, schist, and gneiss. This sequence of metamorphic rocks reflects an increase in grain size, a change in rock texture, and a change in mineralogy. Limestone, which is composed of the mineral calcite (CaCO3), is the parent rock of marble, while quartz (SiO2) sandstone is the parent of quartzite. Because calcite and quartz are simple chemical compounds compared to clay minerals, their mineralogy does not change during metamorphism; calcite usually remains calcite, and quartz remains quartz. Rather, these minerals recrystallize to produce larger fused grains that are the main constituents of marble and quartzite, The major characteristics of the most common metamorphic rocks are summarized in Notice that metamorphic rocks can be broadly classified by the type of foliation exhibited and, to a lesser extent, the chemical composition of the parent rock. It is worth noting that certain rock names (slate, schist, and gneiss) are also used to describe rock texture."}

Phyllite exhibits rock cleavage and is composed mainly of very fine crystals of mainly muscovite, chlorite, or both. \n\nSchist Medium- to coarse-grained metamorphic rocks in which platy minerals are dominant are called schists. These flat components commonly include muscovite and biotite that display parallel alignments that give the rock its foliated texture . In addition, schists contain smaller amounts of other minerals, often quartz and feldspar. Some schists are composed mostly of dark minerals (such as amphiboles). As with slate, the parent rock of most schists is shale that has undergone mediumto high-grade metamorphism during a major mountainbuilding episode."}

To indicate composition, mineral names are added. For example, schists composed primarily of muscovite and biotite are called mica schist . Mica schists often contain accessory minerals, some of which are unique to metamorphic rocks. Some common accessory minerals that occur as porphyroblasts include garnet, staurolite, and andalusite, in which case the rock is called garnet-mica schist, staurolite-mica schist, or andalusite-mica schist .

The most common minerals in gneiss are quartz, potassium feldspar, and plagioclase feldspar. Most gneisses also contain lesser amounts of biotite, muscovite, and amphibole. Some gneisses will split along the layers of platy minerals, but most break in an irregular fashion. Recall that during high-grade metamorphism, the light and dark components separate, giving gneisses their characteristic banded or layered appearance. Thus, most gneisses consist of alternating bands of white or reddish feldspar-rich zones and layers of dark ferromagnesian minerals . These banded gneisses often exhibit evidence of deformation, including folds and sometimes Gneisses having a felsic composition may be derived from granite or its fine-grained equivalent, rhyolite. However, most gneisses are generated through highgrade metamorphism of shale. Therefore, gneiss represents the highest-grade metamorphic rock in the sequence of shale, slate, phyllite, schist, and gneiss. Like schists, gneisses may also include large crystals of accessory minerals such as garnet. Gneisses made up primarily of dark minerals also occur.

The basic principle of inclusions is logical and straightforward. The rock mass adjacent to the one containing the inclusions must have been there first in order to provide the rock fragments. Therefore, the rock mass that contains inclusions is the younger of the two. For example, when magma intrudes into surrounding rock, blocks of the surrounding rock may become dislodged and incorporated into the magma. If these pieces do not melt, they remain as inclusions known as xenoliths (see Chapter 4). In another example, when sediment is deposited atop a weathered mass of bedrock, pieces of the weathered rock become incorporated into the younger sedimentary layer . \n\nWhen we observe layers of rock that have been deposC. ited essentially without interruption, we call them conformable. Particular sites exhibit conformable beds representing certain spans of geologic time. However, no place on Earth has a complete set of conformable Throughout Earth history, the deposition of sediment has been interrupted over and over again.

There are three basic types of unconformities, and geologists can use them to identify what intervals of time are not represented by strata and thus are missing from the geologic record. \n\nAngular Unconformity Perhaps the most easily recognized unconformity is an angular unconformity. It consists of tilted or folded sedimentary rocks that are overlain by younger, more flat-lying strata. An angular unconformity indicates that during the pause in deposition, a period of deformation (folding or tilting) and erosion occurred . \n\nThese inclusions of igneous rock contained in the adjacent sedimentary layer indicate the sediments were deposited atop the weathered igneous mass and thus are younger. \n\nXenoliths are inclusions in an igneous intrusion that form when pieces of surrounding rock are incorporated into magma."}

Imagine that a series of sedimentary layers is deposited in a shallow marine setting. Following this period of deposition, sea level falls or the land rises, exposing some the sedimentary layers. During this span, when the sedimentary beds are above sea level, no new sediment accumulates, and some of the existing layers are eroded away. Later, sea level rises or the land subsides, submerging the landscape. Now the surface is again below sea level, and a new series of sedimentary beds is deposited. The boundary separating the two sets of beds is a disconformity\u2014a span for which there is no rock record .

{"id": 357, "text": "Recall from Chapter 3 that each atom has a nucleus that contains protons and neutrons and is orbited by electrons. Electrons have a negative electrical charge, and protons an electron combined, so it has no charge (it is neutral). The atomic number is the number of protons in the nucleus. Every element has a different number of protons and thus a different identifying atomic number (hydrogen = 1, carbon = 6, oxygen = 8, uranium = 92, etc.). Atoms of the same element always have the same number of protons, so the atomic number stays constant. Practically all of an atom\u2019s mass (99.9 percent) is in the nucleus, indicating that electrons have virtually no mass at all. So, by adding the protons and neutrons in an atom\u2019s nucleus, we derive the atom\u2019s mass number. The number of neutrons can vary, and these variants, or isotopes, have different mass numbers. To summarize with an example, uranium\u2019s nucleus always has 92 protons, so its atomic number is always 92. But its neutron population varies, and uranium has three isotopes: uranium-234 (protons + neutrons = 234), uranium-235, and uranium-238. All three isotopes are mixed in nature.

{"id": 359, "text": "Atomic number to daughter atoms is 1:7 (one parent atom for every seven daughter atoms). If the half-life of a radioactive isotope is known and the parent/daughter ratio can be determined, the age of the sample can be calculated. For example, assume that the half-life of a hypothetical unstable isotope is 1 million years, and the parent/daughter ratio in a sample is 1:15. This ratio indicates that four half-lives have passed and that the sample must be 4 million years old. Notice that the percentage of radioactive atoms that decay during one half-life is always the same: 50 percent. However, the actual number of atoms that decay with the passing of each half-life continually decreases. Thus, as the percentage of radioactive parent atoms declines, the proportion of stable daughter atoms rises, with the increase in daughter atoms just matching the drop in parent atoms. This fact is the key to radiometric dating. \n\nfrom previous decay. The radiometric \u201cclock\u201d starts at this point.

Because no 40Ar was present when the mineral formed, all of the daughter atoms trapped in the mineral sample\u2019s age, the 40K/40Ar ratio is measured precisely and basic principle of radiometric dating is simple, the actual procedure is quite complex. The analysis that determines the quantities of parent and daughter must be painstakingly precise. In addition, some radioactive materials do not decay directly into the stable daughter product, as was the case with our hypothetical example, and this fact may further complicate the analysis. In the case of uranium-238, there are 13 intermediate unstable daughter products formed before the 14th and last daughter product, the stable isotope lead-206, is produced (see ). Sources of Error It is important to understand that an accurate radiometric date can be obtained only for a mineral that remained a closed system from its formation to the present. Obtaining a correct date is not possible unless there was neither addition nor loss of parent or daughter isotopes. This is not always the case, and an important limitation of the potassium-argon method arises from the fact that argon is a gas, and it may leak from minerals, throwing off measurements. Indeed, losses can be significant if the rock is subjected to relatively high temperatures. Of course, a reduction in the amount of daughter product, 40Ar, would lead to underestimating the rock\u2019s actual age. Sometimes temperatures remain high enough over a sufficiently long period so that all argon escapes. When this happens, the potassium-argon clock is reset, and dating the sample gives only the time of thermal resetting, not the true age of the rock. For other radiometric clocks, a loss of daughter atoms can occur if the rock has been subjected to weathering or leaching. To avoid such a problem, one simple safeguard is to use only fresh, unweathered material and not samples that exhibit signs of chemical alteration. To guard against error in radiometric dating, scientists often use cross-checks. This involves subjecting a sample to two different methods. If the results agree, the likelihood is high that the date is reliable. If the results are appreciably different, other cross-checks must be employed to determine which, if either, is correct."}

Ductile Deformation Ductile deformation is a process in which a rock body is forced to flow in a solid state so that it changes shape without fracturing. Ordinary objects that display ductile behavior include modeling clay, beeswax, taffy, and some metals. For example, an automobile\u2019s fender may be dented but not broken when hit by another vehicle."}
{"id": 379, "text": "Ductile deformation may occur by slippage along planes of weakness such as bedding surfaces and foliation in rock bodies. Recall from Chapter 8 that individual mineral grains may also change shape through the process of solid-state flow . \n\nThe major factors that influence the strength of a rock and how it will deform include temperature, confining pressure, rock type, and time. \n\nThe Role of Confining Pressure Recall from Chapter 8 that pressure, like temperature, increases with depth as the thickness of the overlying rock increases. Buried rocks are subjected to confining pressure, which is much like water pressure, where the forces are applied equally in all directions. Confining pressure \u201csqueezes\u201d the materials in Earth\u2019s crust, making the materials stronger and thus harder to break. Therefore, rocks that are deeply buried are \u201cheld together\u201d by the immense pressure and tend to bend rather than fracture."}
{"id": 380, "text": "The Role of Temperature The effect of temperature on the strength of a material can be easily demonstrated with a piece of glass tubing commonly found in a chemistry lab. If the tubing is dropped on a hard surface, it will shatter. However, if the tubing is heated over a Bunsen burner, it can be easily bent into a variety of shapes. Rocks respond to heat similarly. Where temperatures are high (deep in Earth\u2019s crust), rocks tend to soften and become more malleable, so they deform by folding or flowing (ductile deformation). Likewise, where temperatures are low (at or near the surface), rocks tend to behave like brittle solids and fracture. \n\nSome outcrops\u2014sites where bedrock is exposed at the surface\u2014consist of a sequence of interbedded weak and strong rock layers, such as shale and well-cemented sandstone beds, that have been moderately deformed by folding. In these settings, the strong sandstone layers are often highly fractured, while the weak shale beds form broad undulating folds. The formation of diverse structures (one brittle and one ductile) within the same rock mass can be illustrated by placing a Milky Way or similar chocolateover-caramel candy bar into a refrigerator. When the cool candy bar is slowly bent, it will exhibit brittle deformation in the chocolate and ductile deformation in the caramel."}
{"id": 381, "text": "Time as a Factor One key factor that researchers are unable to duplicate in the laboratory is how rocks respond to small stresses applied gradually over long spans of geologic time. However, we can observe the effects of time on deformation in everyday settings. For example, marble benches have been known to sag under their own weight over a time span of 100 years or so, and wooden bookshelves may bend within a few months after being loaded with books. In general, when tectonic forces are applied gradually over long spans of time, rocks tend to display ductile behavior and deform by bending or flowing. However, the same rocks may shatter if force is applied suddenly. An analogous situation occurs when you slowly move the two ends of a taffy bar together. The taffy will deform by folding. However, if you hit the taffy swiftly against the edge of a table, it will break into two or more pieces, exhibiting brittle failure. \n\nDeformation caused by three types of stress Brittle deformation (fracturing and faulting) dominates in the upper crust, where the temperatures are comparatively cool. By contrast, at depths greater than about 10 kilometers (6 miles), where temperatures are high, rock deforms by ductile flow and folding. \n\nillustrates deformation of Earth\u2019s crust as a result of the three types of stress: compressional, tensional, and shear stress. Compressional stresses associated with convergent plate boundaries tend to shorten and thicken Earth\u2019s crust by folding, flowing, and faulting, whereas tensional stresses along divergent plate boundaries tend to lengthen rock bodies by displacement along faults in the upper crust and by ductile flow at depth. Shearing, often associated with transform plate boundaries, tends to produce fault zones in the upper crust and ductile flow at depth. Brittle deformation\u2014 fracturing and faulting\u2014dominates in the upper crust, where temperatures are relatively cool. By contrast, at greater depths where temperatures and pressures are high, rocks exhibit ductile behavior and deform by folding or flowing."}

By contrast, large faults, like the San Andreas Fault in California, have displacements of hundreds of kilometers and consist of many interconnecting fault surfaces. These structures, described as fault zones, can be several kilometers wide and are often easier to identify from aerial photographs than at ground level. Because faults have nearly planar surfaces, geologists describe their orientations by their strike and dip. Strike can be defined as the direction of a horizontal line on an inclined surface. For example, the strike (or trend) of the San Andreas Fault is in a northwesterly direction. Dip is the angle of inclination of a surface measured from a horizontal plane. The San Andreas is nearly vertical, so it has a dip, or inclination, of about 90 degrees. By contrast, some faults are nearly horizontal, with dips of 10 degrees or less. Strike and dip can be used to describe the orientation of sedimentary layers, dikes, joints, and other planar structures, in addition to faults.

Here the jointing results from the gradual expansion that occurs when erosion removes the overlying load and reduces pressure on the rock.

Extensive joint patterns often develop in response to relatively subtle and often barely perceptible regional upwarping and downwarping of the crust. In many cases, the cause of jointing at a particular locale is not particularly obvious. Many rocks are broken by two or even three sets of intersecting joints that slice the rock into numerous regularly shaped blocks. These joint sets often exert a strong influence on other geologic processes. For example, chemical weathering tends to be concentrated along joints, and joint patterns influence how groundwater moves through the crust . Joints may also be significant from an economic standpoint. Some of the world\u2019s largest and most important mineral deposits are located along joint systems.

{"id": 402, "text": "Is an Earthquake? 11.1 What Sketch and describe the mechanism that generates most earthquakes. An earthquake is ground shaking caused by the sudden and rapid movement of one block of rock slipping past another along fractures in Earth\u2019s crust called faults. Most faults are locked, except for brief, abrupt movements when sudden slippage produces an earthquake. Faults are locked because the confining pressure exerted by the overlying crust is enormous, causing these fractures in the crust to be \u201csqueezed shut.\u201d Earthquakes tend to occur along preexisting faults where internal stresses cause the crustal rocks to rupture or break into two or more units. The location where slippage begins is called the hypocenter, or focus. Earthquake waves radiate from this spot outward into the surrounding rock. The point on Earth\u2019s surface directly above the hypocenter is called the epicenter . Large earthquakes release huge amounts of stored-up energy as seismic waves\u2014a form of energy that travels through the lithosphere and Earth\u2019s interior. The energy carried by these waves causes the material that transmits them to shake. Seismic waves are analogous to waves produced when a stone is dropped into a calm pond. Just as the impact of the stone creates a pattern of circular waves, an earthquake generates waves that radiate outward in all directions from the hypocenter. Although seismic energy dissipates rapidly as it moves away from the quake\u2019s hypocenter, sensitive instruments can detect earthquakes even when they occur on the opposite side of Earth. Thousands of earthquakes occur around the world every day. Fortunately, most are small and cannot be detected by people. Of these, only about 15 strong earthquakes (magnitude 7 or greater) are recorded each year, many of them occurring in remote regions.

Because fossils of marine organisms have been discovered thousands of meters above sea level, we know that large sections of Earth\u2019s crust have been thrust upward.

Some sections of the San Andreas Fault exhibit slow, gradual displacement known as fault creep and produce little seismic shaking. Other segments slip at relatively closely spaced intervals, producing numerous small to moderate earthquakes. Still other segments remain locked and store elastic energy for a few hundred years before they break loose. Ruptures on these segments usually result in major earthquakes.

Perhaps the first attempt to scientifically describe the aftermath of an earthquake came following the great Italian earthquake of 1857. By systematically mapping effects of the earthquake, a measure of the intensity of ground shaking was established. The map generated by this study used lines to connect places of equal damage and hence equal ground shaking. Using this technique, zones of intensity were identified, with the zone of highest intensity located near the center of maximum ground shaking and often (but not always) the earthquake epicenter. In 1902, Giuseppe Mercalli developed a more reliable intensity scale, which is still used today in a modified form. The Modified Mercalli Intensity scale, shown in Table 11.1, was developed using California buildings as its standard.

Despite its usefulness, the Richter scale is not adequate for describing very large earthquakes. For example, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and the 1964 Alaska earthquake have roughly the same Richter magnitudes. However, based on the relative size of the affected areas and the associated tectonic changes, the Alaska earthquake released considerably more energy than the San Francisco quake. Thus, the Richter scale is considered saturated for major earthquakes because it cannot distinguish among them. Despite this shortcoming, Richter-like scales are still used because they can be calculated quickly. \n\nMoment Magnitude For measuring medium and large earthquakes, seismologists now favor a newer scale, total energy released during an earthquake. Moment magnitude is calculated by determining the average amount of slip on the fault, the area of the fault surface that slipped, and the strength of the faulted rock. Moment magnitude can also be calculated by modeling data obtained from seismograms. The results are converted to a magnitude number, as in other magnitude scales. As with the Richter scale, each unit increase in moment magnitude equates to roughly a 32-fold increase in the energy released. \n\nBecause moment magnitude estimates the total energy released, it is better than the Richter scale for measuring very large earthquakes. Seismologists have used the moment magnitude scale to recalculate the magnitudes of older strong earthquakes. For example, the 1964 Alaska earthquake, originally given a Richter magnitude of 8.3, has since been recalculated using the 9.2. Conversely, the 1906 San Francisco earthquake that was given a Richter magnitude of 8.3 was downgraded to Chilean subduction zone earthquake, with a moment magnitude of 9.5."}

Earth\u2019s surface is extremely cold compared to the interior, so newly formed oceanic lithosphere cools rapidly . This causes oceanic lithosphere to contract, become denser and heavier, and, in time, sink back into the mantle at subduction zones. As these cold sinking slabs descend, they absorb heat. Some of this crustal material eventually becomes warm and buoyant enough to return to the surface. Cool oceanic lithosphere can therefore be thought of as the top of the mantle convection cycle, whereas rising mantle rock below spreading centers and the warm buoyant rocks called mantle plumes are the upward-flowing arms of this convection cycle . Convection sometimes occurs when differences in density arise through chemical rather than thermal means. Chemical convection is an important mechanism operating in the outer core.

These connected motions do not necessarily interact in a predictable, steady manner; instead, they tend to occur episodically or in pulses. One example is the possible connection between magnetic reversals, hot-spot volcanism, and the breakup of the supercontinent Pangaea. Pangaea began to break up about 200 million years ago, and the accompanying increase in plate motion resulted in the subduction of large amounts of seafloor. About 80 million years later, the magnetic reversal process shut down, preventing Earth\u2019s magnetic field from reversing for 35 million years. During this period, several enormous outpourings of lava have been linked to the arrival of new hot-spot mantle plumes at the surface. In one hypothesis, these three events are closely connected. In the 80 million years following the breakup of Pangaea, a large amount of subducted lithosphere is thought to have plunged to the base of the mantle. This would have displaced hot rock at the base of the mantle, causing much of it to rise toward the surface and erupt as flood basalts. India\u2019s Deccan Traps are an example of such a process.

Explain at least one logistic issue or difficulty posed by drilling in water this deep. \n\nResearchers, Inc. \n\nThe greatest volume of magma (more than 60 percent of Earth\u2019s total yearly output) is produced along the oceanic ridge system in association with seafloor spreading. As plates diverge, fractures created in the oceanic crust fill with molten rock that gradually wells up from the hot mantle below. This molten material slowly cools and crystallizes, producing new slivers of seafloor. This process repeats in episodic bursts, generating new lithosphere that moves away from the ridge crest in a conveyor belt fashion. \n\nThe primary reason for the elevated position of the ridge system is that newly created oceanic lithosphere is hot and therefore less dense than cooler rocks of the deepocean basin. As the newly formed basaltic crust travels away from the ridge crest due to seafloor spreading, it is cooled from above as seawater circulates through the pore spaces and fractures in the rock. Further cooling occurs as it gets farther and farther from the zone of hot mantle upwelling. As a result, the lithosphere gradually cools, contracts, and becomes denser. This thermal contraction accounts for the greater ocean depths that occur away from the ridge. After about 80 million years of cooling and contraction, rock that was once part of an elevated ocean-ridge system becomes part of the deepocean basin. As lithosphere is displaced away from the ridge crest, cooling also causes a gradual increase in lithospheric thickness. This happens because the boundary between the lithosphere and asthenosphere is a thermal (temperature) boundary. Recall from Chapter 12 that the lithosphere is Earth\u2019s cool, stiff outer layer, whereas the asthenosphere is a comparatively hot and weak layer. As material in the uppermost asthenosphere ages (cools), it becomes stiff and rigid. Thus, the upper portion of the asthenosphere is gradually converted to lithosphere simply by cooling. Oceanic develops along the ridge crest, and the topography of the ridge is typically rugged."}

{"id": 499, "text": "An interesting aspect of oceanic crust is that its thickness and structure are remarkably consistent throughout the entire ocean basin. Seismic soundings indicate that its thickness averages only about 7 kilometers (5 miles). Furthermore, it is composed almost entirely of mafic rocks that are underlain by a layer of the ultramafic rock peridotite, which forms the lithospheric mantle. Although most oceanic crust forms out of view, far below sea level, geologists have been able to examine the structure of the ocean floor firsthand. In locations such as Newfoundland, Cyprus, Oman, and California, slivers of oceanic crust and underlying mantle have been thrust high above sea level. From these exposures and core samples collected by deep-sea drilling ships, researchers have concluded that the ocean crust consists of four distinct layers : r Layer 1. The upper layer is a sequence of deep-sea sediments or sedimentary rocks. Sediments are very thin near the axes of oceanic ridges but may be several kilometers thick next to continents. r Layer 2. Below the layer of sediments is a rock unit composed mainly of basaltic lavas that contain abundant pillowlike structures called pillow lavas. r Layer 3. The middle, rocky layer is made up of numerous interconnected dikes that have a nearly vertical orientation, called the sheeted dike complex. These dikes are former pathways where magma rose to feed pillow basalts on the ocean floor."}

When fragments of oceanic crust and the underling mantle are discovered on land, they are called an ophiolite complex. From studies of various ophiolite complexes around the globe and related data, geologists have pieced together a scenario for the formation of the ocean floor."}
{"id": 501, "text": "The molten rock that forms new oceanic crust originates from partial melting of the ultramafic mantle rock. This process generates basaltic melt that is less dense than the surrounding solid rock. The newly formed melt rises through the upper mantle along thousands of tiny conduits that feed into a few dozen larger, elongated channels, perhaps 100 meters (300 feet) or more wide. These structures, in turn, feed lens-shaped magma chambers located directly beneath the ridge crest. The addition of melt from below steadily increases the pressure inside the magma chambers. As a result, the rocks above these reservoirs periodically fracture, allowing the melt to ascend along numerous vertical fractures that develop in the ocean crust. Some of the melt cools and solidifies to form dikes. New dikes intrude older dikes, which are still warm and weak, to form a sheeted dike complex. This portion of the oceanic crust is usually 1 to 2 kilometers thick. Roughly 10 to 20 percent of the melt eventually erupts on the ocean floor. Because the surface of these submarine lava flows is chilled quickly by seawater, these flows generally travel no more than a few kilometers before completely solidifying. The forward motion occurs as lava accumulates behind the congealed margin and then breaks through. This process occurs repeatedly, as molten basalt is extruded\u2014like toothpaste from a tightly squeezed tube (see page 148). The result is protuberances resembling large bed pillows stacked one atop the other, hence the name pillow lavas . In some settings, pillow lavas may build volcano-size mounds that resemble shield volcanoes, whereas in other situations they form elongated ridges tens of kilometers long. These structures are eventually separated from their supply of magma as they are carried away from the ridge crest by seafloor spreading."}
{"id": 502, "text": "The lowest unit of the ocean crust develops from crystallization within the central magma chamber itself. The first minerals to crystallize are olivine, pyroxene, and occasionally chromite (chromium oxide), which settle through the magma to form a layered zone near the floor of the reservoir. The remaining melt tends to cool along the walls of magma chambers to form massive amounts of coarse-grained gabbro. This portion accounts for up to 5 of the 7 kilometers (3 to 4.5 miles) of ocean crust thickness. Although molten rock rises continuously from the mantle toward the surface, seafloor spreading occurs in pulse-like bursts. As the melt begins to accumulate in the lens-shaped reservoirs, it is blocked from continuing upward by the stiff overlying rocks. As the amount of melt entering the magma reservoirs increases, pressure rises. Periodically, the pressure exceeds the strength of the overlying rocks, which fracture and initiate a short episode of seafloor spreading."}

It is important to note that the lithospheric mantle, which makes up about 80 percent of the descending oceanic slab, drives subduction. Even when the oceanic crust is quite old, its density is still less than that of the underlying asthenosphere. Subduction, therefore, depends on lithospheric mantle that is colder and therefore denser than the underlying asthenosphere. When an oceanic slab descends to about 400 kilometers (250 miles), mineral phase changes (transitions from low-density mineral to high-density mineral; see Chapter 12) enhance subduction. At this depth, the transition of olivine to its compact, much denser spinel structure increases the density of the slab, which helps pull the plate into the subduction zone."}

In areas where forced subduction occurs, a strong coupling develops between the overlying plate and the subducting plate, which can result in particularly strong and frequent earthquakes.

Subduction along these active continental margins is associated with long-lasting magmatic activity that builds continental volcanic arcs. The result is crustal thickening, with the crust reaching thicknesses of more than 70 kilometers (45 miles). The first stage in the development of Andean-type mountain belts, named after the Andes Mountains of South America, occurs along passive continental margins geologically inactive regions located some distance from plate boundaries. Passive continental margins develop when continental blocks rift apart and are separated by seafloor spreading that occurs along a mid-ocean ridge. The margins on both sides of the Atlantic provide modern examples of passive continental margins, where continued deposition of sediments has produced a thick platform of shallow-water sandstones, limestones, and shales (see page 392). The formation of an Andean-type mountain begins when the forces that drive plate motions change and a subduction zone develops along the margin of a continent. In order for a new subduction zone to form, oceanic lithosphere must be old and dense enough to create a downward force capable of shearing the lithosphere.

{"id": 533, "text": "Most major mountain belts are generated when one or more buoyant crustal fragments collide with a continental margin as a result of subduction. Whereas oceanic lithosphere, which is relatively dense, readily subducts, continental lithosphere contains significant amounts of low-density crustal rocks and is therefore too buoyant to undergo subduction. Consequently, the arrival of a crustal fragment at a trench results in a collision and usually ends further subduction."}
{"id": 534, "text": "Accretion and Orogenesis As oceanic plates move, they carry embedded oceanic plateaus, volcanic island arcs, and microcontinents to an Andean-type subduction zone. When an oceanic plate contains small seamounts, these structures are generally subducted along with the descending oceanic slab. However, large, thick units of oceanic crust, such as the Ontong Java Plateau, which is the size of Alaska, or an island arc composed of abundant \u201clight\u201d igneous rocks, render the oceanic lithosphere too buoyant to subduct. In these situations, a collision between the crustal fragment and the continental margin occurs. The sequence of events that happen when small crustal fragments reach a Cordilleran-type margin is shown in Rather than subduct, the upper crustal layers of these thickened zones are \u201cpeeled\u201d from the descending plate and thrust in relatively thin sheets on the adjacent continental block. Convergence does not generally end with the accretion of a crustal fragment. Rather, new subduction zones typically form, and they can carry other island arcs or microcontinents toward a collision with the continental margin. Each collision displaces earlier accreted terranes further inland, adding to the zone of deformation as well as to the thickness and lateral extent of the continental margin."}

Research suggests that prior to their accretion to a continental block, some of these fragments may have been microcontinents similar to the modern-day island of Madagascar, located east of Africa in the Indian Ocean. Many others were island arcs similar to Japan, the Philippines, and the Aleutian Islands. Still others may have been submerged oceanic plateaus created by massive outpourings of basaltic lavas associated with mantle plumes (see pages 390\u2013391). More than 100 of these relatively small crustal fragments, most of which are in the Pacific, are known to exist."}

During the breakup of Pangaea, the eastern portion of the Pacific basin (Farallon plate) began to subduct under the western margin of North America. This activity resulted in the piecemeal addition of crustal fragments to the entire Pacific margin of the continent\u2014from Mexico\u2019s Baja Peninsula to northern Alaska .

{"id": 537, "text": "Alpine-type orogenies, named after the Alps that have been intensively studied for more than 200 years, occur where two continental masses collide. This type of orogeny may also involve the accretion of continental fragments or island arcs that occupied the ocean basin that once separated the two continental blocks. Mountain belts formed by the closure of major ocean basins include the Himalayas, Appalachians, Urals, and Alps . Continental collisions result in the development of mountains characterized by shortened and thickened crust, achieved through folding and large-scale thrust faulting. The zone where two continents collide and are \u201cwelded\u201d together is called the suture. This portion of the mountain belt often preserves slivers of oceanic lithosphere, or ophiolites, that were trapped between the colliding plates. The unique structure of these pieces of oceanic lithosphere (see page 404) helps identify the collision boundary. Noteworthy features of most collisional mountain ranges are fold-and-thrust belts. These mountainous zones result from the deformation of thick sequences of shallow marine sedimentary rocks, like those currently found along passive continental margins of the Atlantic. During continental collisions, sedimentary rocks are pushed inland, away from the core of the developing mountain belt and over the stable continental interior. In essence, crustal shortening is achieved by displacement along thrust faults where once relatively flat-lying strata are \u201csliced\u201d into thick layers that are eventually stacked one upon another. During this displacement, material caught between the thrust faults is often folded, thereby forming the other major structure of a fold-and-thrust belt. Excellent examples of fold-and-thrust belts are found in the Appalachian Valley and Ridge province, the Canadian Rockies, the Lesser (southern) Himalayas, and the northern Alps. In the next section we take a closer look at two examples of collisional mountains: the Himalayas and the Appalachians. The Himalayas, Earth\u2019s youngest collisional mountains, are still rising. By contrast, the Appalachians are a much older mountain belt, in which active mountain building ceased about 250 million years ago."}

However, other tectonic processes, such as continental rifting, can also produce mountainous terrain. Recall that continental rifting occurs when tensional forces stretch and thin the lithosphere, resulting in upwelling of hot mantle rock. Upwelling heats the thinned lithosphere, which becomes less dense (more buoyant) and rises. This accounts, in part, for the elevated topography associated with continental rifts. Simultaneously, stretching elongates the rigid upper crust, which breaks into large crustal blocks that are bounded by high-angle normal faults. Continued rifting causes the blocks to tilt, with one edge rising as the other drops (see page 314). Mountains that form in these tectonic settings are termed fault-block mountains."}

{"id": 550, "text": "Where compressional forces are great, such as those driving India into Asia, lofty mountains such as the Himalayas result. Is there a limit on how high a mountain can rise? As mountaintops are elevated, gravity-driven processes such as erosion and mass wasting are accelerated, carving the deformed strata into rugged landscapes. Equally important, however, is the fact that gravity also acts on the rocks within these massive structures. The higher the mountain, the greater the downward force on rocks near the base. Eventually, the rocks deep within the developing mountain, which are relatively warm and weak, begin to flow laterally, as shown in This is analogous to what happens when a ladle of very thick pancake batter is poured onto a hot griddle. Similarly, mountains are altered by a process called gravitational collapse, which involves ductile spreading at depth and normal faulting and subsidence in the upper, brittle portion of Earth\u2019s crust. Considering these factors, a seemingly logical question follows: \u201cWhat keeps the Himalayas standing?\u201d Simply, the horizontal compressional forces that are driving India into Asia are greater than the vertical force of gravity. However, when India\u2019s northward trek ends, the downward pull of gravity, as well as weathering and erosion, will become the dominant forces acting on this mountainous region."}

Gravitational collapse results Evidence from seismic in stretching and thinning (see of the crust 12.19, page 379) indicates that a large mass of hot mantle rock is centered below the southern tip of Africa. This structure, called a superplume, extends upward about 2900 kilometers (1800 miles) from the core\u2013mantle boundary and has a lateral expanse of a few thousand kilometers. Researchers have determined that the upward flow associated with this huge mantle plume is sufficient to elevate southern Africa. Crustal Subsidence Extensive areas of downwarping also occur at Earth\u2019s surface. In the United States, large, nearly circular basins are found in Michigan and Illinois. Similar structures are known on other continents as well. The cause of the downwarping that created these basins may be linked to the subduction of slabs of oceanic lithosphere. One proposal suggests that when subduction ceases, the descending slab detaches from the trailing lithosphere and continues its descent into the mantle. As this detached lithospheric slab sinks, it creates a downward flow in its wake that tugs at the base of the overriding continent. In some settings, the crust is apparently pulled down sufficiently to produce a large basin that eventually fills with sediments. As the oceanic slab sinks deeper into the mantle, the pull of the trailing wake weakens, and the continent \u201cfloats\u201d back into isostatic balance."}

Taken together, slopes are the most common elements in our physical landscape. Although most slopes may appear to be stable and unchanging, the force of gravity causes rock material to move downslope by way of processes we call mass wasting. At one extreme, the movement may be gradual and practically imperceptible. At the other extreme, it may consist of a roaring debris flow or a thundering rock avalanche. Some mass-wasting processes are dangerous events that represent significant geologic hazards.

{"id": 555, "text": "The chapter-opening photo is a striking example of a phenomenon that many people would call a landslide. For most of us, the word landslide implies a sudden event in which large quantities of rock and soil plunge down steep slopes. When people and communities are in the way, a natural disaster may result. Landslides constitute major geologic hazards that each year in the United States cause billions of dollars in damages and the loss of dozens of lives. As you will see, many landslides occur in connection with other major natural disasters, including earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and severe storms. If you were to view several images of events called landslides, you would likely notice that the term seems to refer to several different things\u2014from mudflows to rock avalanches. This variety reflects the fact that although many people, including geologists, frequently use the word landslide, the term has no specific definition in geology. Rather, it is a popular, nontechnical word used to describe any or all relatively rapid forms of mass wasting. Landslides are spectacular examples of a basic geologic process called mass wasting. Mass wasting refers to the downslope movement of rock, regolith, and soil under the direct influence of gravity. It is distinct from the erosional processes that are examined in subsequent chapters in that mass wasting does not require a transporting medium, such as water, wind, or glacial ice. Landslides are not just events that occur in remote mountains and canyons. People frequently live where rapid mass-wasting events occur. Nevertheless, even in populated areas with steep slopes, catastrophic landslides are relatively rare. Consequently, people living in susceptible areas often do not appreciate the risks of living where they do. However, such events occur with some regularity around the world.

By itself, weathering does not produce significant landforms. Rather, landforms develop as products of weathering are removed from the places where they originate. Once weathering weakens and breaks rock apart, mass wasting transfers the debris downslope, where a stream or glacier, acting as a conveyor belt, usually carries it away. Although there may be many intermediate stops along the way, the sediment is eventually transported to its ultimate destination: the sea."}

As mountain building subsides, mass-wasting and erosional processes lower the land. Through time, steep and rugged mountain slopes give way to gentler, more subdued terrain. Thus, as a landscape ages, massive and rapid mass-wasting processes give way to smaller, less dramatic downslope movements that are often imperceptibly slow. \n\n1. Define mass wasting.

In what environment are rapid mass-wasting processes most likely to occur? \n\nSummarize the factors that control and trigger mass-wasting processes. \n\nGravity is the controlling force of mass wasting, but several factors play important roles in overcoming inertia and creating downslope movements. Long before a landslide occurs, various processes work to weaken slope material, gradually making it more and more susceptible to the pull of gravity. During this span, the slope remains stable but gets closer and closer to being unstable. Eventually, the strength of the slope is weakened to the point that something causes the slope to cross the threshold from stability to instability. Such an event that initiates downslope movement is called a trigger. Remember that a trigger is not the sole cause of a mass-wasting event but just the last of many causes. Among the common factors that trigger mass-wasting processes are saturation of material with water, oversteepening of slopes, removal of anchoring vegetation, and ground vibrations from earthquakes."}

Oversteepening also produces unstable slopes and mass movements in cohesive soils, regolith, and bedrock.

The tragic event occurred when a mass of rock from a canyon wall plunged 150 meters (500 feet) down a nearly vertical slope to the valley floor. Because of safety concerns, the park was closed so that landslide specialists from Their study concluded that the landslide occurred without triggering by external conditions. Many rapid mass-wasting events occur without a discernible trigger. Slope materials gradually weaken over time, under the influence of long-term weathering, infiltration of water, and other physical processes. Eventually, if the strength falls below what is necessary to maintain slope stability, a landslide will occur. The timing of such events is random, and thus accurate prediction is impossible.

The Gros Ventre River flows west from the northernmost part of the Wind River Range in northwestern Wyoming, through Grand Teton National Park, and eventually empties into the Snake River. On June 23, 1925, a massive rockslide took place in its valley, just east of the small town of Kelly.

The end product is a flowing tongue of well-mixed mud, soil, rock, and water. Its consistency may range from that of wet concrete to a soupy mixture not much thicker than muddy water. The rate of flow, therefore, depends not only on the steepness of the slope but also on the water content. Dense debris flows are capable of carrying or pushing large boulders, trees, and even houses with relative ease. Debris flows pose a serious hazard to development in relatively dry mountainous areas such as southern California. The construction of homes on canyon hillsides and the removal of native vegetation by brush fires and other means have increased the frequency of these destructive events. Moreover, when a debris flow reaches the end of a steep, narrow canyon, it spreads out, covering the area beyond the mouth of the canyon with a mixture of wet debris. This material contributes to the buildup of fanlike deposits, called alluvial fans, at canyon mouths. The fans are relatively easy to build on, often have nice views, and are close to the mountains; in fact, like the nearby canyons, many have become preferred sites for development. Because debris flows occur only sporadically, the public is often unaware of the potential hazard of such sites."}

The materials most commonly involved are rich in clay and silt and contain only small proportions of sand and coarser particles.

Indeed, sudden movements are responsible for moving less material than the slower and far more subtle action of creep. Whereas rapid types of mass wasting are characteristic of mountains and steep hillsides, creep takes place on both steep and gentle slopes and is thus much more widespread."}
{"id": 576, "text": "Creep is a type of mass wasting that involves the gradual downhill movement of soil and regolith. One factor that contributes to creep is the alternating expansion and contraction of surface material caused by freezing and thawing or wetting and drying. As shown in 15.20, freezing or wetting lifts particles at right angles to the slope, and thawing or drying allows the particles to fall back to a slightly lower level. Each cycle therefore moves the material a tiny distance downslope. Creep is aided by anything that disturbs the soil, such as raindrop impact and disturbance by plant roots and burrowing animals. Creep is also promoted when the ground becomes saturated with water. Following a heavy rain or snowmelt, a water-logged soil may lose its internal cohesion, allowing gravity to pull the material downslope. Because creep is imperceptibly slow, the process cannot be observed in action. However, the effects of creep can be observed. Creep causes fences and utility poles to tilt and retaining walls to be displaced ."}

{"id": 583, "text": "Recall that most of the precipitation that falls on land either enters the soil (infiltration) or remains at the surface, moving downslope as runoff. The amount of water that runs off rather than soaks into the ground depends on several factors: (1) the intensity and duration of rainfall, (2) the amount of water already in the soil, (3) the nature of the surface material, (4) the slope of the land, and (5) the extent and type of vegetation. When the surface material is highly impermeable or when it becomes saturated, runoff is the dominant process. Runoff is also high in urban areas because large areas are covered by impermeable buildings, roads, and parking lots. \n\nThe primary movement of water through the cycle is shown by the large arrows. annual amount of water taking a particular path. \n\nRunoff initially flows in broad, thin sheets across slopes in a process called sheet flow. This thin, unconfined flow eventually develops threads of current that form tiny channels called rills. Rills meet to form gullies, which join to form brooks, creeks, or streams. Then, when they reach an undefined size, they are called rivers. Although the terms river and stream are often used interchangeably, geologists define stream as water that flows in a channel, regardless of size. River, on the other hand, is a general term for streams that carry substantial amounts of water and have numerous tributaries. In humid regions, the water to support streamflow comes from two sources: overland flow that sporadically enters the stream and groundwater that enters the channel. In areas where the bedrock is composed of soluble rocks such as limestone, large openings may exist that facilitate the transport of groundwater to streams. In arid regions, however, the water table may be below the level of the stream channel, in which case the stream loses water to the groundwater system by outflow percolating through the streambed."}

Thus, through headward erosion, a valley is extended into previously undissected terrain. In the tributaries to Utah\u2019s San Rafael River illustrate this process."}
{"id": 585, "text": "Rivers drain much of the land area, with the exception of extremely arid regions or polar areas that are permanently frozen. To a large extent, the variety of rivers that exist is a reflection of the different environments in which they are found. For example, although the Paran\u00e1\u2013La Plata river system in South America drains an area roughly the same size as the Nile in Egypt, it carries nearly 10 times more water to the ocean. Because its drainage basin is entirely in a rainy tropical climate, the Paran\u00e1\u2013La Plata system has a huge discharge. By contrast, the Nile, which also originates in a humid region, flows through an expansive arid landscape, where significant amounts of water evaporate or are withdrawn to sustain agriculture. Thus, climatic differences and human intervention can significantly influence the character of a river. Later, we will examine other factors that contribute to stream variability. River systems not only involve a network of stream channels but the entire drainage basin. Based on the dominant processes operating within them, river systems can be divided into three zones: sediment production\u2014where erosion dominates, sediment transport, and sediment deposition . It is important to recognize that sediment is being eroded, transported, and deposited along the entire length of a stream, regardless of which process is dominant within each zone."}
{"id": 586, "text": "The zone of sediment production, where most of the sediment is derived, is located in the headwaters region of the river system. Much of the sediment carried by streams begins as bedrock that is subsequently broken down by weathering and then moved downslope by mass wasting and by way of sheet flow and rills. Bank erosion can also contribute significant amounts of sediment. In addition, scouring of the channel bed deepens the channel and adds to the stream\u2019s sediment load."}
{"id": 587, "text": "Sediment acquired by a stream is transported through the channel network along sections called trunk streams. When trunk streams are in balance, the amount of sediment eroded from their banks equals the amount deposited elsewhere in the channel. \n\nAlthough trunk streams rework their channels over time, they are not a source of sediment, nor do they accumulate or store it."}
{"id": 588, "text": "When a river reaches the ocean or another large body of water, it slows, and the energy to transport sediment is greatly reduced. Most of the sediments accumulate at the mouth of the river to form a delta, are reconfigured by wave action to form a variety of coastal features, or are moved far offshore by ocean currents. Because coarse sediments tend to be deposited upstream, it is primarily the fine sediments (clay, silt, and fine sand) that eventually reach the ocean. Taken together, erosion, transportation, and deposition are the processes by which rivers move Earth\u2019s surface materials and sculpt landscapes. \n\nDrainage systems are interconnected networks of streams that form a variety of patterns. The nature of a drainage pattern can vary greatly from one type of terrain to another, primarily in response to the kinds of rock on which the streams developed and/or the structural pattern of joints, faults, and folds (see Chapter 10). illustrates four drainage patterns."}

For example, river valleys occasionally cut through a ridge or mountainous topography that lies across their path. This situation is illustrated by the trellis pattern in through a tectonic structure is called a water gap . Why do streams cut across such structures and not flow around them? One possibility is that a stream existed before the ridge or mountain was uplifted. In this situation, the stream, called an antecedent stream, eroded its bed downward at a pace equal to the rate of uplift. That is, the stream would maintain its course as folding or faulting gradually raised the structure across its path. eroded its channel into an existing structure (see 16.8). This can occur when folded beds or resistant rocks are buried beneath layers of relatively flat-lying sediments or sedimentary strata. Streams originating on the overlying strata establish their courses without regard to the structures below. Then, as the valley deepens, the river continues to cut its valley into the underlying structure. The folded Appalachians feature several superposed rivers, including the Potomac and the Susquehanna, which cut their channels through folded strata on their way to the Atlantic."}

{"id": 595, "text": "As water in a stream channel moves downslope, it encounters a significant amount of frictional resistance. The cross-sectional shape (a slice taken across the channel) determines, to a large extent, the amount of flow that comes in contact with the banks and bed of the channel.

The most efficient channel is one with the least wetted perimeter for its cross-sectional area. compares two channels that differ only in shape: One is wide and shallow, the other is narrow and deep. Although the cross-sectional area of both is identical, the narrow and deep one has less water in contact with the channel (a smaller wetted perimeter) and therefore less frictional drag. As a result, if all other factors are equal, the water will flow more efficiently and at a higher velocity in a deep and narrow channel than in a wide and shallow channel."}
{"id": 596, "text": "Discharge Streams vary in size from small headwater creeks less than a meter wide to large rivers with widths of several kilometers. The size of a stream channel is largely determined by the amount of water supplied from the drainage basin. The measure most often used to compare the size of streams is discharge\u2014the volume of water flowing past a certain point in a given unit of time. Discharge, usually measured in cubic meters per second or cubic feet per second, is determined by multiplying a stream\u2019s crosssectional area by its flow velocity. The largest river in North America, the Mississippi, has an average discharge at its mouth of about 16,800 cubic meters (593,000 cubic feet) per second . That figure is dwarfed by South America\u2019s mighty Amazon River, which discharges nearly 13 times more water than the Mississippi. GEOgraphics 16.1 presents more information on Earth\u2019s major rivers. \n\nThe discharge of a river system changes over time because of variations in the amount of precipitation received by the drainage basin. Studies show that when discharge increases, the width, depth, and flow velocity of the channel all increase predictably. As we saw earlier, when the size of the channel increases, proportionally less water is in contact with the bed and banks of the channel. This reduces friction, which acts to retard the flow, resulting in an increase in the rate of streamflow."}

{"id": 599, "text": "One useful way of studying a stream is to examine its longitudinal profile. Such a profile is simply a crosssectional view of a stream from its source area (called the head, or headwaters) to its mouth, the point downstream where it empties into another water body\u2014a river, a lake, or the ocean. shows that the most obvious feature of a typical longitudinal profile is its concave shape\u2014a result of the decrease in slope that occurs from the headwaters to the mouth. In addition, local irregularities exist in the profiles of most streams; the flatter sections may be associated with lakes or reservoirs, and the steeper sections are sites of rapids or waterfalls. The change in slope observed on most stream profiles is usually accompanied by an increase in discharge and channel size, as well as a reduction in sediment particle size . For example, data from successive gaging stations along most rivers show that, in humid regions, discharge increases toward the mouth. This should come as no surprise because, as we move downstream, more and more tributaries contribute water to the main channel. In the case of the Amazon, for example, about 1000 tributaries join the main river along its 6500-kilometer (4000-mile) course across South America. In order to accommodate the growing volume of water, channel size typically increases downstream as well. Recall that flow velocities are higher in large channels than in small channels. Furthermore, observations show a general decline in sediment size downstream, making the channel smoother and more efficient. Although the channel slope decreases\u2014the gradient becomes less steep\u2014toward a stream\u2019s mouth, the flow velocity generally increases. This fact contradicts our intuitive assumptions of swift, narrow headwater streams and wide, placid rivers flowing across more subtle topography. Increases in channel size and discharge and decreases in channel roughness that occur downstream compensate for the decrease in slope\u2014thereby making the stream more efficient . Thus, the average flow velocity is typically lower in headwater streams than in wide, placid-appearing rivers."}

Not only do they have the ability to deepen and widen their channels, but streams also have the capacity to transport enormous quantities of sediment delivered to them by overland flow, mass wasting, and groundwater. Eventually, much of this material is deposited to create a variety of landforms."}
{"id": 601, "text": "Stream Erosion weathered rock is aided by the work of raindrops, which knock sediment particles loose (see on page 202). When the ground is saturated, rainwater cannot infiltrate, so it flows downslope, transporting some of the material it dislodges. On barren slopes the flow of muddy water (sheet flow) often produces small channels (rills), which in time can evolve into larger gullies (see 6.25 on page 203). Once flow is confined within a channel, the erosional power of a stream is related to its slope and discharge. The rate of erosion, however, also depends on the relative resistance of the bank and bed material. In general, channels composed of unconsolidated materials are more easily eroded than channels cut into bedrock. When a channel is sandy, the particles are easily dislodged from the bed and banks, and they are lifted into the moving water. Moreover, banks consisting of sandy material are often undercut, or eroded at their base, dumping even more loose debris into the water to be carried downstream. Banks that consist of coarse gravels or cohesive clay and silt particles tend to be relatively resistant to erosion. Thus, channels with cohesive silty banks are generally narrower than comparable ones with sandy banks."}
{"id": 602, "text": "Streams cut channels into bedrock through three main processes: quarrying, abrasion, and corrosion. \n\nQuarrying Quarrying involves the removal of blocks from the bed of a stream channel. This process is aided by fracturing and weathering that loosen the blocks sufficiently so they are movable during times of high flow rates. Quarrying is mainly a result of the impact forces exerted by flowing water. Abrasion The process by which the bed and banks of a bedrock channel are ceaselessly bombarded by particles carried into the flow is termed abrasion. The individual sediment grains are also abraded by their many impacts with the channel and with one another. Thus, by scraping, rubbing, and bumping, abrasion erodes a bedrock channel and simultaneously smooths and rounds the abrading particles. That is why smooth, rounded cobbles and pebbles are found in streams. Abrasion also results in a reduction in the size of the sediments transported by streams. Features common to some bedrock channels are circular depressions known as potholes, which are created by the abrasive action of particles swirling in fast-moving eddies . The rotational motion of sand and pebbles acts like a drill that bores the holes. As the particles wear down to nothing, they are replaced by new ones that continue to drill the streambed. Eventually, smooth depressions several meters across and deep may result. Corrosion Bedrock channels formed in soluble rock such as limestone are susceptible to corrosion\u2014a process in which rock is gradually dissolved by the flowing water. Corrosion is a type of chemical weathering between the solutions in the water and the mineral matter that makes up the bedrock."}

Streams also sort the solid sediment they transport because finer, lighter material is carried more readily than larger, heavier particles. Streams transport their load of sediment in three ways: (1) in solution (dissolved load), (2) in suspension (suspended load), and (3) by sliding, skipping, or rolling along the bottom (bed load)."}

When water percolates through the ground, it acquires soluble soil compounds. Then it seeps through cracks and pores in bedrock, dissolving additional mineral matter. Eventually much of this mineral-rich water finds its way into streams. The velocity of streamflow has essentially no effect on a stream\u2019s ability to carry its dissolved load; material in the solution goes wherever the stream goes. Precipitation of the dissolved mineral matter occurs when the chemistry of the water changes, when organisms create hard parts, or when the water enters an inland \u201csea,\u201d located in an arid climate where the rate of evaporation is high."}

Particles that are too large or heavy to move by saltation either roll or slide along the bottom, depending on their shapes. The movement of bed load through a stream network tends to be less rapid and more localized than the glacially fed river in Norway determined that suspended sediments took only a day to exit the drainage basin, while the bed load required several decades to travel the same distance. Depending on the discharge and slope of the channel, coarse gravels may only be moved during times of high flow, while boulders move only during exceptional floods. Once set in motion, large particles are usually carried short distances. Along some stretches of a stream, bed load cannot be carried at all until it is broken into smaller particles. \n\nresults in greater capacity; the increased velocity produces greater competency. Rising velocity makes the water more turbulent, and larger particles are set in motion. In the course of a few days, or perhaps just a few hours, a stream at flood stage can erode and transport more sediment than it does during several months of normal flow."}
{"id": 606, "text": "Deposition occurs whenever a stream slows, causing a reduction in competence. Put another way, particles are deposited when the flow velocity is less than the settling velocity. As a stream\u2019s flow velocity decreases, sediment begins to settle, largest particles first. In this manner, stream transport provides a mechanism by which solid particles of various sizes are separated. This process, called sorting, explains why particles of similar size are deposited together. For example, you may have seen stretches of a riverbed consisting mainly of gravel or boulders, while sandbars may have dominated another part of the stream. The general term for sediment deposited by streams is alluvium. Many different depositional features are composed of alluvium. Some occur within stream channels, some occur on the valley floor adjacent to a channel, and some are found at the mouth of a stream. We will consider the nature of these features later in the chapter."}

{"id": 609, "text": "As the name suggests, bedrock channels are cut into the underlying strata and typically form in the headwaters of river systems where streams have steep slopes. The energetic flow tends to transport coarse particles that actively abrade the bedrock channel. Potholes are often visible evidence of the erosional forces at work. Steep bedrock channels often develop a sequence of steps and pools, relatively flat segments (pools) where alluvium tends to accumulate and steep segments (steps) where bedrock is exposed. The steep areas contain rapids or, occasionally, waterfalls. The channel pattern exhibited by streams cutting into bedrock is controlled by the underlying geologic structure. Even when flowing over rather uniform bedrock, streams tend to exhibit winding or irregular patterns rather than flowing in straight channels. Anyone who has gone whitewater rafting has observed the steep, winding nature of a stream flowing in a bedrock channel. \n\nErosion of a cut bank along the Newaukum River in southwestern Washington State. \n\nThe cut bank forms on the outside of a meander where flow velocity and turbulence are greatest."}
{"id": 610, "text": "As water slows on the inside of a meander, coarser material is deposited as a point bar. \n\nsufficient width, material deposited by the stream can form a floodplain that borders the channel. Because the banks and beds of alluvial channels are composed of unconsolidated sediment (alluvium), they can undergo major changes in shape as material is continually being eroded, transported, and redeposited. The major factors affecting the shapes of these channels are the average size of the sediment being transported, the channel\u2019s gradient, and Alluvial channel patterns reflect a stream\u2019s ability to transport its load at a uniform rate while expending the least amount of energy. Thus, the size and type of sediment being carried help determine the nature of the stream channel. Two common types of alluvial channels are meandering channels and braided channels."}
{"id": 611, "text": "Streams that transport much of their load in suspension generally move in sweeping bends called meanders. These streams flow in relatively deep, smooth channels and primarily transport mud (silt and clay), sand, and occasionally fine gravel. The lower Mississippi River exhibits this type of channel. Meandering channels evolve over time as individual bends migrate across the floodplain. Most of the erosion is focused at the outside of the meander, where velocity and turbulence are greatest. In time, the outside bank is undermined, especially during periods of high water. Because the outside of a meander is a zone of active erosion, it is often referred to as a cut bank . Debris acquired by the stream at the cut bank moves downstream, where the coarser material is generally deposited as point bars on the insides of bends. In this manner, meanders migrate laterally by eroding the outside of the bends and depositing sediment on the inside, moving sideways without appreciably changing their shape. In addition to migrating laterally, the bends in a channel also migrate down the valley. This occurs because erosion is more effective on the downstream (downslope) side of the meander. Sometimes the downstream migration of a meander is slowed when it reaches a more resistant bank material. This allows the next meander upstream to gradually erode the material between the two meanders, as shown in Eventually, the river may erode through the narrow neck of land, forming a new, shorter channel segment called a cutoff. Because of its shape, the abandoned bend is called an oxbow lake."}
{"id": 612, "text": "stream\u2019s sediment load consists of coarse material (sand and gravel) and the stream has a highly variable discharge. Because the bank material is readily erodible, braided channels are wide and shallow. One setting in which braided streams form is at the end of glaciers, where there is a large seasonal variation in discharge. During the summer, large amounts of iceeroded sediment are dumped into the meltwater streams flowing away from the glacier. However, when flow is sluggish, the stream deposits the coarsest material as elongated structures called bars. This process causes the flow to split into several paths around the bars. During the next period of high flow, the laterally shifting channels erode and redeposit much of this coarse sediment, thereby transforming the entire streambed. In some braided streams, the bars have built semipermanent islands anchored by vegetation."}

Alluvial channels often flow in valleys that have wide valley floors consisting of sand and gravel deposited in the channel and clay and silt deposited by floods. Bedrock channels, on the other hand, tend to be located in narrow V-shaped valleys. In some arid regions, where weathering is slow and rock is particularly resistant, narrow valleys having nearly vertical walls are also found. Such features are called slot canyons . Stream valleys exist on a continuum from narrow, steep-sided valleys to valleys that are so flat and wide that the valley walls are not discernible. Streams, with the aid of weathering and mass wasting, shape the landscape through which they flow. As a result, streams continuously modify the valleys they occupy. \n\nChanges in base level act as a temporary base level. The stream concentrates its erosive energy on the resistant rock at the knickpoint. Eventually the river eliminates the knickpoint and reestablishes a smooth profile."}

These famous falls are supported by a resistant bed of dolostone that is underlain by less-resistant shale. As the water plunges over the lip of the falls, it erodes the less-resistant shale, undermining a section of overlying rock, which eventually breaks off. In this manner, the waterfall retains its vertical cliff while slowly, but continually, retreating upstream. Over the past 12,000 years, Niagara Falls has retreated more than 11 kilometers (7 miles) upstream. \n\nAs a stream approaches a graded condition\u2014in which it primarily works to transport sediment\u2014downcutting becomes less dominant. At this point the stream\u2019s channel takes on a meandering pattern, and more of its energy is directed from side to side. As a result, the valley widens as the river cuts away at one bank and then the other. \n\nThe Niagara River flows from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario.

Alluvium deposited during floods covers the valley floor."}
{"id": 617, "text": "The continuous lateral erosion caused by shifting meanders gradually produces a broad, flat valley floor covered with alluvium . This feature, called a floodplain, is appropriately named because when a river overflows its banks during flood stage, it inundates the floodplain. Over time the floodplain will widen to a point where the stream is actively eroding the valley walls in only a few places. In the case of the lower Mississippi River, for example, the distance from one valley wall to another sometimes exceeds 160 kilometers (100 miles). When a river erodes laterally and creates a floodplain as described, it is called an erosional floodplain. Floodplains can be depositional as well. Depositional floodplains are produced by major fluctuations in conditions, such as changes in base level or climate. The floodT plain in California\u2019s Yosemite Valley is one such feature; it was produced when a glacier gouged the valley floor about 300 meters (1000 feet) deeper than its former level. After the glacial ice melted, running water refilled the valley with alluvium. The Merced River currently winds across a relatively flat floodplain that forms much of the floor of Yosemite Valley."}

As the plateau gradually rose, meandering rivers began downcutting because of their steepening gradient.

As a result, sediment is not added in sufficient quantities to offset compaction, subsidence, and wave erosion. Thus, the size of the delta and the extent of the wetlands are shrinking.

{"id": 626, "text": "Meandering rivers that occupy valleys with broad floodplains tend to build natural levees (lever = to raise) that parallel their channels on both banks . Natural levees are built by years of successive floods. When a stream overflows onto the floodplain, the water flows over the surface as a broad sheet. Because the flow velocity drops significantly, the coarser portion of the suspended load is immediately deposited adjacent to the channel. As the water spreads across the floodplain, a thin layer of fine sediment is laid down over the valley floor. This uneven distribution of material produces the gentle, almost imperceptible, slope of the natural levee . The natural levees of the lower Mississippi River rise 6 meters (20 feet) above the adjacent valley floor. The area behind a levee is characteristically poorly drained for the obvious reason that water cannot flow over the levee and into the river. Marshes called back swamps often result. When a tributary stream enters a river valley that has a substantial natural levee, it often flows for many kilometers through the back swamp before finding an opening where it enters the main river. Such streams are called yazoo tributaries, after the Yazoo River, which parallels the lower Mississippi River for more than 300 kilometers (185 miles)."}
{"id": 627, "text": "Alluvial fans are fan-shaped deposits that accumulate along steep mountain fronts . When a stream with a steep gradient emerges onto a relatively flat lowland, its gradient drops, and it deposits a large portion of its sediment load. Although alluvial fans are more prevalent in arid climates (see Chapter 19 for a further discussion of alluvial fans), they are occasionally found in humid regions. Mountain streams, because of their steep gradients, carry much of their sediment load as coarse sand and gravel. Because alluvial fans are composed of these same coarse materials, water that flows across them readily soaks in. When a stream emerges from its valley onto an alluvial fan, its flow divides itself into several distributary channels. The fan shape is produced because the main flow swings back and forth between the distributaries from a fixed point where the stream exits the mountain. Between rainy periods in deserts, little or no water flows across an alluvial fan, which is evident in the many dry channels that cross its surface. Thus, fans in dry regions grow intermittently, receiving considerable water and sediment only during wet periods. As you learned in Chapter 15, steep canyons in dry regions are prime locations for debris flows. Therefore, as would be expected, many alluvial fans have debris-flow deposits interbedded with the coarse alluvium. \n\n1.

{"id": 635, "text": "Artificial Levees Artificial levees are earthen mounds built on riverbanks to contain a stream in its channel when the water volume increases. Levees, used since ancient times, are the most commonly used stream-containment structures. In some locations, concrete floodwalls are constructed that function as artificial levees. Many artificial levees were not built to withstand periods of extreme flooding. For example, numerous levees failed during the summer of 1993, when the upper Mississippi and many of its tributaries experienced record flooding. During that event, floodwalls at St. Louis, Missouri, created a bottleneck for the river that led to increased flooding upstream of the city. When exceptional floods threaten to overwhelm levees, water is sometimes intentionally diverted from a river by creating openings in artificial levees. The purpose is to spare vulnerable urban areas by allowing water to flood sparsely populated rural areas. The areas that are intentionally flooded are called floodways. For example, to prevent the town of Cairo, Illinois, from being inundated during the 2011 floods along the Mississippi River, a 3-kilometer- (2-mile-) wide opening was blasted in a levee. This allowed water to spill into the 130,000-acre Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway ( 16.38). Similar steps were taken downstream in Louisiana to protect the cities of Baton Rouge and New Orleans."}

Engineers removed 16 meander bends on the lower Mississippi for the purpose of increasing the slope of the channel and thereby reducing the threat of flooding. This river, a vital transportation corridor, was shortened about 240 kilometers (150 miles). These efforts have been somewhat successful in reducing the maximum height of the river during flood stage. However, channel shortening led to increased gradients and accelerated erosion of bank material, both of which necessitated further intervention. Following the creation of artificial cutoffs, massive bank protection was installed along several stretches of the lower Mississippi. bank erosion occurred on the Blackwater River in Missouri, whose meandering course was shortened in 1910. Among the many effects of this project was a significant increase in the channel\u2019s width due to increased velocity.

Since the 1920s, thousands of dams have been built on nearly every major river in the United States. Many dams have significant non-flood-related functions, such as providing water for irrigated agriculture and for hydroelectric power generation. Many reservoirs are also major regional recreational facilities. Although dams are effective in reducing flooding and provide other benefits, their construction and maintenance also have significant costs and consequences. For example, reservoirs created by dams may cover valuable farmland, forests, historic sites, and scenic valleys. Large dams can also cause significant damage to river ecosystems that have developed over thousands of years. Furthermore, building dams is not a permanent solution to flooding.

Rather, a large percentage of precipitation soaks into the ground and then moves slowly under the surface to stream channels. Groundwater is thus a form of storage that sustains streams during periods when rain does not fall. Therefore, when we see water flowing in a river during a dry period, it is rain that fell at some earlier time and was stored underground."}

This last path is the primary source of practically all subsurface water. The amount of water that takes each of these paths varies greatly both in time and space. Influential factors include steepness of slope, nature of the surface material, intensity of rainfall, and type and amount of vegetation. For example, heavy rains falling on steep slopes underlain by impervious materials will obviously result in a high percentage of the water running off. Conversely, rain falling steadily and gently on more gradual slopes composed of materials that are easily penetrated by the water means that a much larger percentage of water soaks into the ground. \n\nSome of the water that soaks in does not travel far because it is held by molecular attraction as a surface film on soil particles. This near-surface zone is called the zone of soil moisture.

Soil water is used by plants in life functions and transpiration.

Although a considerable amount of water can be present in the unsaturated zone, this water cannot be pumped by wells because it clings too tightly to rock and soil particles.

Groundwater moves by twisting and turning through small interconnected openings. The smaller the pore spaces, the more slowly the water moves.

Impermeable layers that hinder or prevent water movement are termed aquitards (aqua = water, tard = slow). Clay is a good example.

Darcy also experimented with different materials, such as coarse sand and fine sand, by measuring the rate of flow through sediment-filled tubes that were tilted at varying angles.

The result is a depression in the water table, roughly conical in shape, known as a cone of depression . Because the cone of depression increases the hydraulic gradient near the well, groundwater will flow more rapidly toward the opening. For most small domestic wells, the cone of depression is negligible. However, when wells are heavily pumped for irrigation or for industrial purposes, the withdrawal of water can be great enough to create a very wide and steep cone of depression. This may substantially lower the water table in an area and cause nearby shallow wells to become dry. illustrates this situation. Digging a successful well is a familiar challenge for people in areas where groundwater is the primary source of supply. One well may be successful at a depth of 10 meters (33 feet), whereas a neighbor may have to go twice as deep to find an adequate supply. Still others may be forced to go deeper or try a different site altogether. When subsurface materials are heterogeneous, the amount of water that a well can provide may vary a great deal over short distances. For example, when two nearby wells are drilled to the same level and only one is successful, it may be because there is a perched water table beneath one of them. As illustrates, a perched water table forms where an aquitard is situated above the main water table. Massive igneous and metamorphic rocks provide a second example.

Over several years, Perrault computed the quantity of water that fell on France\u2019s Seine River basin. He then calculated the mean annual runoff by measuring the river\u2019s discharge. After allowing for the loss of water by evaporation, he showed that there was sufficient water remaining to feed the springs. Thanks to Perrault\u2019s pioneering efforts and the measurements by many afterward, we now know that the source of springs is water from the zone of saturation and that the ultimate source of this water is precipitation. Whenever the water table intersects Earth\u2019s surface, a natural outflow of groundwater results, and we call this a spring. Springs often form when an aquitard blocks the downward movement of groundwater and causes the water to move laterally. Where the permeable bed crops out, a spring results. Another example is illustrated in 17.16, which shows a perched water table intersecting a Springs, however, are not confined to places where a perched water table creates a flow at the surface.

The great abundance, diversity, and spectacular nature of geysers and other thermal features in Yellowstone undoubtedly was the primary reason for its becoming the first national park in the United States. Geysers are also found in other parts of the world, notably New Zealand and Iceland. In fact, the Icelandic word geysa, meaning \u201cto gush,\u201d gives us the name geyser. \n\nHow Geysers Work Geysers occur where extensive underground chambers exist within hot igneous rocks. How they operate is shown in As relatively cool groundwater enters these chambers, it is heated by the surrounding rock. At the bottom of the chambers, the water is under great pressure because of the weight of the overlying water. This great pressure prevents the water from boiling at the normal surface at the bottom of a 300-meter (1000-foot) water-filled will boil. The heating causes the water to expand, and as a result, some is forced out at the surface. This loss of water reduces the pressure on the remaining water turns to steam, and the geyser erupts.

Because of its high porosity, excellent permeability, and great size, the High Plains aquifer, the largest in the United States, accumulated enough freshwater to fill Lake Huron."}
{"id": 671, "text": "Many believe that groundwater is an endlessly renewable resource because it is continually replenished by rainfall and melting snow. But in some regions, groundwater has been and continues to be treated as a nonrenewable resource. Where this occurs, the water available to recharge the aquifer falls significantly short of the amount being withdrawn. The High Plains aquifer provides one example . Underlying about 111 million acres (450,000 square kilometers [174,000 square miles]) in parts of eight western states, it is one of the largest and most agriculturally significant aquifers in the United States. It accounts for about 30 percent of all groundwater withdrawn for irrigation in the country. Mean annual precipitation on the High Plains is modest\u2014ranging from about 40 centimeters (16 inches) in western portions to about 71 centimeters (28 inches) in eastern parts. Evaporation rates, on the other hand, are high\u2014 ranging from about 150 centimeters (60 inches) in the cooler northern parts of the region to 265 centimeters (105 inches) in the warmer southern parts. Because evaporation rates are high relative to precipitation, there is little rainwater to recharge the aquifer. Thus, in some parts of the region where intense irrigation has been practiced for an extended period, groundwater depletion Geological Survey estimates that since 1950, water storage in the High Plains aquifer has declined about 267 million acre feet (about 87 trillion gallons), with 60 percent of the total decline having occurred in Texas."}

One common source of groundwater pollution is sewage. Its sources include an ever-increasing number of septic tanks, as well as inadequate or broken sewer systems and farm wastes. If sewage water that is contaminated with bacteria enters the groundwater system, it may become purified through natural processes. The harmful bacteria may be mechanically filtered by the sediment through which the water percolates, destroyed by chemical oxidation, and/or assimilated by other organisms. For purification to occur, however, the aquifer must be of the correct composition. For example, extremely permeable aquifers (such as highly fractured crystalline rock, coarse gravel, or cavernous limestone) have such large openings that contaminated groundwater may travel long distances without being filtered and cleansed.

Material that is dissolved by the groundwater is eventually discharged into streams and carried to the ocean. In many cases, cavern development has occurred at several levels, with the current cavern-forming activity occurring at the lowest elevation. This situation reflects the close relationship between the formation of major subterranean passages and the river valleys into which they drain. As streams cut their valleys deeper, the water table drops as the elevation of the river drops. Consequently, during periods when surface streams are rapidly downcutting, surrounding groundwater levels drop rapidly, and cave passages are abandoned by the water while the passages are still relatively small in cross-sectional area. Conversely, when the entrenchment of streams is slow or negligible, there is time for large cave passages to form."}

The water of the hydrosphere is constantly cycled through the atmosphere, biosphere, and geosphere. Time and time again, water evaporates from the oceans into the atmosphere, precipitates on the land, and flows in rivers and underground back to the sea. However, when precipitation falls at high elevations or high latitudes, the water may not immediately make its way toward the sea. Instead, it may become part of a glacier. Although the ice will eventually melt, allowing the water to continue its path to the sea, water can be stored as glacial ice for many tens, hundreds, or even thousands of years. the accumulation, compaction, and recrystallization not; glaciers move very slowly. Like running water, groundwater, wind, and waves, glaciers are dynamic erosional agents that accumulate, transport, and deposit sediment.

Glaciers develop in the high-latitude polar realm because, even though annual snowfall totals are modest, temperatures are so low that little of the snow melts. Glaciers can form in mountains because temperatures drop with an increase in altitude. So even near the equator, glaciers may form at elevations above about 5000 meters (16,400 feet). For example, Tanzania\u2019s Mount Kilimanjaro, which is located practically astride the equator at an altitude of 5895 meters (19,336 feet), has glaciers at its summit. The elevation above which snow remains throughout the year varies with latitude.

{"id": 696, "text": "When temperatures remain below freezing following a snowfall, the fluffy accumulation of delicate hexagonal crystals soon changes. As air infiltrates the spaces between the crystals, the extremities of the crystals evaporate, and the water vapor condenses near the centers of the crystals. In this manner, snowflakes become smaller, thicker, and more spherical, and the large pore spaces disappear. As air is forced out, what was once light, fluffy snow is recrystallized into a much denser mass of small grains having the consistency of coarse sand. This granular recrystallized snow is called firn and is commonly found making up old snow banks near the end of winter. As more snow is added, the pressure on the lower layers gradually increases, compacting the ice grains at depth. Once the thickness of ice and snow exceeds 50 meters (165 feet), the weight is sufficient to fuse firn into a solid mass of interlocking ice crystals. Glacial ice has now been formed. The rate at which this transformation occurs varies. In regions where the annual snow accumulation is great, burial is relatively rapid, and snow may turn to glacial ice in a matter of a decade or less. Where the yearly addition of snow is less abundant, burial is slow, and the transformation of snow to glacial ice may take hundreds of years."}

Although the total volume of glacial ice today is great, exceeding 25 million cubic kilometers, during the Last Glacial Maximum the volume of glacial ice amounted to about 70 million cubic kilometers, or 45 million cubic kilometers more than at present. Because we know that the snow from which glaciers are made ultimately comes from the evaporation of ocean water, the growth of ice sheets must have caused a significant worldwide drop in sea level . Indeed, estimates suggest that sea level was as much as 100 meters (330 feet) lower than it is today. Thus, land that is presently flooded by the oceans was dry. The Atlantic coast of the United States lay more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) to the east of New York City, France and Britain were joined where the famous English Channel is today, Alaska and Siberia were connected across the Bering Strait, and Southeast Asia was tied by dry land to the islands of Indonesia.

As noted, there was a time when the most popular explanation for what we now know to be glacial deposits was that the materials had been drifted in by means of icebergs or perhaps simply swept across the landscape by a catastrophic flood. What convinced geologists that an extensive ice age was responsible for these deposits and many other glacial features?"}
{"id": 725, "text": "Historical Development of the Glacial Theory In 1821 a Swiss engineer, Ignaz Venetz, presented a paper suggesting that glacial landscape features occurred at considerable distances from the existing glaciers in the Alps. This implied that the glaciers had once been larger and occupied positions farther downvalley. Another Swiss scientist, Louis Agassiz, doubted the proposal of widespread glacial activity put forth by Venetz. He set out to prove that the idea was not valid. However, his 1836 fieldwork in the Alps convinced him of the merits of his colleague\u2019s hypothesis. In fact, a year later Agassiz hypothesized a great ice age that had extensive and far-reaching effects\u2014 an idea that was to give Agassiz widespread fame. The proof of the glacial theory proposed by Agassiz and others constitutes a classic example of applying the principle of uniformitarianism. Realizing that certain features are produced by no other known process but glacial action, the scientists were able to begin reconstructing the extent of now-vanished ice sheets based on the presence of features and deposits found far beyond the margins of present-day glaciers and ice sheets. In this manner, the development and verification of the glacial theory continued during the nineteenth century, and through the efforts of many scientists, a knowledge of the nature and extent of former ice sheets became clear. By the beginning of the twentieth century, geologists had largely determined the extent of the Ice Age glaciation. Further, during the course of their investigations, they discovered that many glaciated regions had not one but several layers of drift. Moreover, close examination of these older deposits showed well-developed zones of chemical weathering and soil formation, as well as the remains of plants that require warm temperatures. The evidence was clear: There had been not just one glacial advance but many, each separated by extended periods when climates were as warm as or even warmer than the present. The Ice Age had not simply been a time when the ice advanced over the land, lingered for a while, and then receded. Rather, the period was a very complex event, characterized by a number of advances and withdrawals of glacial ice. By the early twentieth century, a fourfold division of the Ice Age had been established for both North America and Europe. These divisions were based largely on studies of glacial deposits. In North America each of the four major stages was named for the midwestern state where deposits of that stage were well exposed and/or were first studied. These are, in order of occurrence, the Nebraskan, Kansan, Illinoian, and Wisconsinan. These traditional divisions remained in place for many years, until it was learned that sediment cores from the ocean floor contain a much more complete record of climate change during the Ice Age. Unlike the glacial record on land, which is punctuated by many unconformities, seafloor sediments provide an uninterrupted record of climatic cycles for this period . Studies of these seafloor sediments showed that glacial/interglacial cycles had occurred about every 100,000 years. About 20 such cycles of cooling and warming were identified for the span we call the Ice Age. During the Ice Age, ice left its imprint on almost 30 percent of Earth\u2019s land area, including about 10 million square kilometers of North America, 5 million square kilometers of Europe, and 4 million square kilometers of Siberia . The amount of glacial ice in the Northern Hemisphere was roughly twice that in the Southern Hemisphere. The primary reason is that the southern polar ice could not spread far beyond the margins of Antarctica. By contrast, North America and Eurasia provided great expanses of land for the spread of ice sheets. Today we know that the Ice Age began between 2 million and 3 million years ago. This means that most of the major glacial stages occurred during a division of the geologic time scale called the Quaternary period. However, this period does not encompass all of the last glacial period. The Antarctic ice sheet, for example, probably formed at least 30 million years ago."}

Two Precambrian glacial episodes have been identified in the geologic record, the first approximately 2 billion years ago and the second about 600 million years ago. Any theory that attempts to explain the causes of ice ages must successfully answer two basic questions: r What causes the onset of glacial conditions? For continental ice sheets to have formed, average temperature must have been somewhat lower than at present, and perhaps substantially lower than throughout much of geologic time. Thus, a successful theory would have to account for the cooling that finally leads to glacial conditions. r What caused the alternating glacial and interglacial stages that have been documented for the Quaternary period? Whereas the first question deals with long-term trends in temperature on a scale of millions of years, this question relates to much shorter-term changes.

This time scale of climate change was then compared to astronomical calculations of eccentricity, obliquity, and precession to determine whether a correlation existed. Although the study was very involved and mathematically complex, the conclusions were straightforward: The researchers found that major variations in climate over the past several hundred thousand years were closely associated with changes in the geometry of Earth\u2019s orbit; that is, cycles of climate change were shown to correspond closely with the periods of obliquity, precession, and orbital eccentricity.

Carbon dioxide and methane are important \u201cgreenhouse\u201d gases, which means they trap radiation emitted by Earth and contribute to atmospheric heating. When the amount of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere increases, global temperatures rise, and when there is a reduction in these gases, as occurred during the Ice Age, temperatures fall. Therefore, reductions in the concentrations of greenhouse gases help explain the magnitude of the temperature drop that occurred during glacial times. Although scientists know that concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane dropped, they do not know what caused the drop. As often occurs in science, observations gathered during one investigation yield information and raise questions that require further analysis and explanation. Obviously, whenever Earth enters an ice age, extensive areas of land that were once ice free are covered with ice and snow. In addition, a colder climate causes the area covered by sea ice (frozen surface seawater) to expand. Ice and snow reflect a large portion of incoming solar energy back to space. Thus, energy that would have warmed Earth\u2019s surface and the air above is lost, and global cooling is reinforced. Yet another factor that influences climate during glacial times relates to ocean currents. Research has shown that ocean circulation changes during ice ages. For example, studies suggest that the warm current that transports large amounts of heat from the tropics toward higher latitudes in the North Atlantic was significantly weaker during the Ice Age. This would lead to a colder climate in Europe, amplifying the cooling attributable to orbital variations. In conclusion, we emphasize that the ideas just discussed do not represent the only possible explanations for ice ages. Although interesting and attractive, these proposals are certainly not without critics, nor are they the only possibilities currently under study. Other factors may be, and probably are, involved."}

Nevertheless, the world\u2019s dry regions are probably the least familiar land areas on Earth outside the polar realm. As you will see, arid regions are not dominated by a single geologic process.

For many visitors, desert scenery exhibits a striking beauty; to others, the terrain seems bleak. No matter which feeling is elicited, it is clear that deserts are very different from the more humid places where most people live. \n\nWe all recognize that deserts are dry places, but just what is meant by the term dry? That is, how much rain defines the boundary between humid and dry regions? Sometimes it is arbitrarily defined by a single rainfall figure, such as 25 centimeters (10 inches) per year of precipitation. However, the concept of dryness is a relative one that refers to any situation in which an ongoing water deficiency exists."}
{"id": 735, "text": "Dry Climates Climatologists define dry climate as a climate in which yearly precipitation is not as great as the potential loss of water by evaporation. Therefore, dryness is not only related to annual rainfall totals but is also a function of evaporation, which in turn is closely dependent on temperature. As temperatures climb, potential evaporation also increases. As little as 15 to 25 centimeters (6 to 10 inches) of precipitation per year may be sufficient to support coniferous forests in northern Scandinavia or Siberia, where evaporation into the cool, humid air is slight and a surplus of water remains in the soil. However, the same amount of rain falling on Nevada or Iran supports only a sparse vegetative cover because evaporation into the hot, dry air is great. So, clearly, no specific amount of precipitation can serve as a universal boundary for dry climates. The dry regions of the world encompass about 42 million square kilometers (16 million square miles), a surprising 30 percent of Earth\u2019s land surface. No other climate category covers so large a land area. Within water-deficient regions, two climatic types are commonly recognized: desert, or arid, and steppe, or semiarid. The two share many features; their differences are primarily a matter of degree.

Just as in a stream, the wind velocity increases with height above the surface. Also as with a stream, wind transports fine particles in suspension, while heavier ones are carried as bed load. However, the transport of sediment by wind differs from that of running water in two significant ways. First, wind\u2019s lower density compared to water renders it less capable of picking up and transporting coarse materials. Second, because wind is not confined to channels, it can spread sediment over large areas, as well as high into the atmosphere."}

(Photo by resting particles. At first the sand rolls along the surface. When a moving sand grain strikes another grain, one or both of them may jump into the air. Once in the air, the grains are carried forward by the wind until gravity pulls them back toward the surface. When the sand hits the surface, it either bounces back into the air or dislodges other grains, which then jump upward. In this manner, a chain reaction is established, filling the air near the ground with saltating sand grains in a short period of time . Bouncing sand grains never travel far from the surface. Even when winds are very strong, the height of the saltating sand seldom exceeds 1 meter and usually is no greater than 0.5 meter. Some sand grains are too large to be thrown into the air by impact from other particles. When this is the case, the energy provided by the impact of the smaller saltating grains drives the larger grains forward. Estimates indicate that between 20 and 25 percent of the sand transported in a sandstorm is moved in this way."}

{"id": 751, "text": "Describe the processes and features associated with wind erosion. \n\nCompared to running water and glaciers, wind is a relatively insignificant erosional agent. Recall that even in deserts, most erosion is performed by intermittent running water, not by wind. Wind erosion is more effective in arid lands than in humid areas because in humid places moisture binds particles together, and vegetation anchors the soil. For wind to be an effective erosional force, dryness and scant vegetation are important prerequisites. When such circumstances exist, wind may pick up, transport, and deposit great quantities of fine sediment. During the 1930s, parts of the Great Plains experienced vast dust storms (see GEOgraphics 6.3, page 204). The plowing under of the natural vegetative cover for farming, followed by severe drought, exposed the land to wind erosion, giving the area its Dust Bowl label. \n\nIn this example, deflation has removed about 1.2 meters (4 feet) of soil\u2013the distance from the man's outstretched arm to his feet."}

For example, in many places, desert pavement is underlain by a relatively thick layer of silt that contains few if any pebbles and cobbles. In such a setting, deflation of fine sediment could not leave behind a layer of coarse particles. Geologists have also found that in some areas, the pebbles and cobbles composing desert pavement have all been exposed at the surface for about the same length of time.

In this way, the leeward slope of the dune, called the slip face, maintains an angle of about 34 degrees, the angle of repose for loose dry sand. (Recall from Chapter 15 that the angle of repose is the steepest angle at which loose material remains stable.) Continued sand accumulation, coupled with periodic slides down the slip face, results in the slow migration of the dune in the direction of air movement. As sand is deposited on the slip face, layers form that are inclined in the direction the wind is blowing. These sloping layers are called Strong winds move sand up the cross-beds .

Rather, the shore has a complex character that results from multiple geologic processes. For example, practically all coastal areas were affected by the worldwide rise in sea level that accompanied the melting of glaciers following the Last Glacial Maximum (see page 558).

Where coasts are irregular, beach formation may be confined to the relatively quiet waters of bays. Beaches consist of one or more berms, which are relatively flat platforms often composed of sand that are adjacent to coastal dunes or cliffs and marked by a change in slope at the seaward edge.

For example, in areas such as southern Florida, where there are no mountains or other sources of rock-forming minerals nearby, most beaches are composed of shell fragments and the remains of organisms on volcanic islands in the open ocean are composed of weathered grains of the basaltic lava that comprise the islands or of coarse debris eroded from coral reefs that Regardless of the composition, the material that comprises the beach does not stay in one place.

The myriad factors that influence coastal areas make shoreline classification difficult. Many geologists classify coasts based on the changes that have occurred with respect to sea level. This commonly used classification divides coasts into two general categories: emergent and submergent. Emergent coasts develop because an area experiences either uplift or a drop in sea level. Conversely, submergent coasts are created when sea level rises or the land adjacent to the sea subsides."}

It offers a brief but deceptive break from the extreme weather in the enormous curving wall clouds that surround it. The air within the eye gradually descends and heats by compression, making it the warmest part of the storm. Although many people believe that the eye is characterized by clear blue skies, this is usually not the case because the subsidence in the eye is seldom strong enough to produce cloudless conditions.

In reality, the shoreline is a dynamic place that can change rapidly in response to natural forces. Exceptional storms are capable of eroding beaches and cliffs at rates that greatly exceed the long-term average. Such bursts of accelerated erosion not only significantly affect the natural evolution of a coast but also can have a profound impact on people who reside in the coastal zone. Erosion along our coasts causes significant property damage. Huge sums are spent annually not only to repair damage but also to prevent or control erosion. Already a problem at many sites, shoreline erosion is certain to become an increasingly serious problem as extensive coastal development continues. During the past 100 years, growing affluence and increasing demands for recreation have brought unprecedented development to many coastal areas. As both the number and the value of buildings have increased, so too have efforts to protect property from storm waves by stabilizing the shore. Also, controlling the natural migration of sand is an ongoing struggle in many coastal areas. Such interference can result in unwanted changes that are difficult and expensive to correct."}
{"id": 797, "text": "Structures built to protect a coast from erosion or to prevent the movement of sand along a beach are collectively known as hard stabilization.

As the term implies, this practice involves adding large quantities of sand to the beach system . Extending beaches seaward makes buildings along the shoreline less vulnerable to destruction by storm waves and enhances recreational uses. Without sandy beaches, tourism suffers. The process of beach nourishment is straightforward. Sand is pumped by dredges from offshore or trucked from inland locations. The \u201cnew\u201d beach, however, will not be the same as the former beach. Because replenishment sand is from somewhere else, typically not another beach, it is new to the beach environment. The new sand is often different in size, shape, sorting, and composition. Such differences pose problems in terms of erodibility and the kinds of life the new sand will support. Beach nourishment is not a permanent solution to the problem of shrinking beaches. The same processes that removed the sand in the first place will eventually remove the replacement sand as well. Nevertheless, the number of nourishment projects has increased in recent years, and many beaches, especially along the Atlantic coast, have had their sand replenished many times. Virginia Beach, Virginia, has been nourished more than 50 times. Beach nourishment is costly. For example, a modest project might involve 38,000 cubic meters (50,000 holds about 7.6 cubic meters (10 cubic yards) of sand. So this small project would require about 5000 dumptruck loads.

Why is such a small fraction of the atmosphere so significant? Certainly the fact that water vapor is the source of all clouds and precipitation is enough to explain its importance. However, water vapor has other roles. Like carbon dioxide, it has the ability to absorb heat energy given off by Earth as well as some solar energy. It is, therefore, important when we examine the heating of the atmosphere."}
{"id": 822, "text": "Ozone Another important component of the atmosphere is ozone. It is a form of oxygen that combines not the same as the oxygen we breathe, which has two atmosphere, and its distribution is not uniform. It is concentrated well above Earth\u2019s surface in a layer called the stratosphere, at an altitude of between 10 and 50 kilometers (6 and 31 miles). The presence of the ozone layer in our atmosphere is crucial to those who dwell on Earth. The reason is that ozone absorbs the potentially harmful filter a great deal of the ultraviolet radiation, and if the as we know it. Aerosols The movements of the atmosphere are sufficient to keep a large quantity of solid and liquid particles suspended within it. Although visible dust sometimes clouds the sky, these relatively large particles are too heavy to stay in the air for very long. Still, many particles are microscopic and remain suspended for considerable periods of time. They may originate from many sources, both natural and human made, and include sea salts from breaking waves, fine soil blown into the air, smoke and soot from fires, pollen and microorganisms lifted by the wind, ash and dust from volcanic eruptions, and more. Collectively, these tiny solid and liquid particles are called aerosols. From a meteorological standpoint, these tiny, often invisible particles can be significant. First, many act as surfaces on which water vapor can condense, an important function in the formation of clouds and fog. Second, aerosols can absorb or reflect incoming solar radiation. Thus, when an air pollution episode is occurring, or when ash fills the sky following a volcanic eruption, the amount of sunlight reaching Earth\u2019s surface can be measurably reduced ."}

Earth\u2019s atmosphere is divided vertically into four layers, on the basis of temperature : r Troposphere. We live in the bottom layer, which is characterized by a decrease in temperature with increasing altitude and is called the troposphere. The term literally means the region where air \u201cturns over,\u201d a reference to the appreciable vertical mixing of air in this lowermost zone. The troposphere is the chief focus of meteorologists because it is in this layer that essentially all important weather phenomena occur. The temperature decrease in the troposphere is called the environmental lapse rate. 1000 feet), a figure known as the normal lapse rate. It should be emphasized, however, that the environmental lapse rate is not a constant but rather can be highly variable and must be regularly measured. To determine the actual environmental lapse rate as well as to gather information about vertical changes in pressure, wind, and humidity, radiosondes are is attached to a weather balloon and transmits data by radio as it ascends through the atmosphere ( 21.14). The thickness of the troposphere is not the same everywhere; it varies with latitude and season. On the average, the temperature drop continues to a height of about 12 kilometers (7.4 miles). The outer boundary of the troposphere is the tropopause. r Stratosphere. Beyond the tropopause is the stratosphere. In the stratosphere, the temperature remains constant to a height of about 20 kilometers (12 miles) and then begins a gradual increase that continues until the stratopause, at a height of nearly 50 kilometers (30 miles) above Earth\u2019s surface. Below the tropopause, atmospheric properties such as temperature and humidity are readily transferred by large-scale turbulence and mixing. Above the tropopause, in the stratosphere, they are not. Temperatures increase in the stratosphere because it is in this layer that the atmosphere\u2019s ozone is concentrated. Recall that ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation from the Sun.

Temperatures rise to in the thermosphere. But such temperatures are not comparable to those experienced near Earth\u2019s surface.

On average, about 50 percent of the solar energy reaching the top of the atmosphere passes through the atmosphere and is absorbed at Earth\u2019s surface. Another 20 percent is absorbed directly by clouds and certain atmospheric gases (including oxygen and ozone) before reaching the surface. The remaining 30 percent is reflected back to space by the atmosphere, clouds, and reflective surfaces such as snow and ice. The fraction of the total radiation that is reflected by a surface is called its albedo . Thus, the albedo for Earth as a whole (the planetary albedo) is 30 percent. What determines whether solar radiation will be transmitted to the surface, scattered, or reflected outward? It depends greatly on the wavelength of the energy being transmitted, as well as on the nature of the intervening material. The numbers shown in represent global averages. The actual percentages can vary greatly, primarily due to changes in the percentage of light reflected and scattered back to space.

Some explanations are controversial. This is to be expected because planetary atmospheric processes are so large-scale and complex that they cannot be reproduced physically in laboratory experiments.

In this section we examine several current hypotheses that have earned serious consideration from the scientific changes, including the effect of rising carbon dioxide levels caused primarily by our burning of fossil fuels. As you read this section, you will find that more than one hypothesis may explain the same change in climate. In fact, several mechanisms may interact to shift climate. Also, no single hypothesis can explain climate change on all time years generally cannot explain fluctuations over hundreds of years.

During The impact on global temperature of eruptions like El Chich\u00f3n and Mount Pinatubo is relatively minor, but many scientists agree that the cooling produced could alter the general pattern of atmospheric circulation for a limited period. Such a change, in turn, could influence the weather in some regions. Predicting, or even identifying, specific regional effects still presents a considerable challenge to atmospheric scientists. Therefore, many great eruptions, closely spaced in time, need to occur if volcanic processes are to have a pronounced impact on climate for an extended period.

Initially, subatomic particles (protons, neutrons, and electrons) formed. Later, as this debris cooled, atoms of hydrogen and helium, the two lightest elements, began to form. Within a few hundred million years, clouds of these gases condensed and coalesced into stars that compose the galactic systems we now observe. As these gases contracted to become the first stars, heating triggered the process of nuclear fusion. Within the interiors of stars, hydrogen nuclei convert to helium nuclei, releasing enormous amounts of radiant energy (heat, light, cosmic rays). Astronomers have determined that in stars more massive than our Sun, other thermonuclear reactions occur that generate all the elements on the periodic table up to number 26, iron. The heaviest elements (beyond number 26) are created only at extreme temperatures during the explosive death of a star eight or more times as massive as the Sun. During these cataclysmic supernova events, exploding stars produce all the elements heavier than iron and spew them into interstellar space. It is from such debris that our Sun and solar system formed.

By 4 billion years ago, scientists estimate that as much as 90 percent of the current volume of seawater was contained in the developing ocean basins. Because volcanic eruptions released into the atmosphere large quantities of sulfur dioxide, which readily combines with water to form hydrochloric acid, the earliest rainwater was highly acidic. The level of acidity was even greater than in the acid rain that damaged lakes and streams in eastern North America during the latter part of the twentieth century. Consequently, Earth\u2019s rocky surface weathered at an accelerated rate. The products released by chemical weathering included atoms and molecules of various substances\u2014including sodium, calcium, potassium, and silica\u2014that were carried into the newly formed oceans. Some of these dissolved substances precipitated to become chemical sediment that mantled the ocean floor. Other substances formed soluble salts, which increased the salinity of seawater. Research suggests that the salinity of the oceans initially increased rapidly but has remained relatively constant over the past 2 billion years. Earth\u2019s oceans also serve as a repository for tremendous volumes of carbon dioxide, a major constituent of the primitive atmosphere. This is significant because carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that strongly influences the heating of the atmosphere. Venus, once thought to be very similar to Earth, has an atmosphere composed of 97 percent carbon dioxide that produced an extreme greenhouse effect. As a result, its Carbon dioxide is readily soluble in seawater, where it often joins other atoms or molecules to produce various chemical precipitates. The most common compound generated by precipitation is calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which makes up limestone, the most abundant chemical sedimentary rock. About 542 million years ago, marine organisms began to extract calcium carbonate from seawater to make their shells and other hard parts. Included were trillions of tiny marine organisms, such as foraminifera, whose shells were deposited on the seafloor at the end of their life cycle. Some of these deposits can be observed today in the chalk beds exposed along the White Cliffs of Dover, England, shown in By \u201clocking up\u201d carbon dioxide, these limestone deposits store this greenhouse gas so it cannot easily reenter the atmosphere."}

Each extinction wreaked havoc with the existing biosphere, wiping out large numbers of species. In each case, however, survivors entered new biological communities that were ultimately more diverse. Therefore, mass extinctions actually invigorated life on Earth, as the few hardy survivors eventually filled more environmental niches than those left behind by the victims. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain these ancient mass extinctions. Initially, paleontologists believed they were gradual events caused by a combination of climate change and biological forces, such as predation and competition. Other research groups have attempted to link certain mass extinctions to the explosive impact of a large asteroid striking Earth\u2019s surface. The most widely held view is that the Permian mass extinction was driven mainly by volcanic activity because it coincided with a period of voluminous eruptions of flood basalts that blanketed about 1.6 million square kilometers (624,000 square miles), an area nearly the size of Alaska. This series of eruptions, which lasted roughly 1 million years, occurred in northern Russia, in an area called the Siberian Traps. It was the largest volcanic eruption in the past 500 million years. The release of huge amounts of carbon dioxide likely generated a period of accelerated greenhouse warming, while the emission of sulfur dioxide is credited with producing copious amounts of acid rain.

The use of the term sand can be misleading because not all deposits are associated with sands and sandstones. Some occur in other materials, including shales and limestones. The oil in these deposits is very similar to heavy crude oils pumped from wells. The major difference between conventional oil reservoirs and oil sand deposits is in the viscosity (resistance to flow) of the oil they contain. In oil sands, the oil is much more viscous and cannot simply be pumped out . Substantial oil sand deposits occur in several locations around the world. By far the largest are in the Canadian province of Alberta . Some oil sands are mined at the surface in a manner similar to the strip mining of coal. The excavated material is then heated with pressurized steam until the bitumen softens and rises. Once collected, the oily material is treated to remove impurities, and then hydrogen is added.

Using drilling technology, steam is injected into the deposit to heat the oil sand, which reduces the viscosity of the bitumen.

Production using in situ techniques already rivals open-pit mining and in the future will replace mining as the main source of bitumen production from the oil sands.

Crystallization in a fluid-rich environment, where ion migration is enhanced, results in the formation of crystals several centimeters, or even a few meters, in length. The resulting rocks, called pegmatites, are composed of these unusually large crystals. Most pegmatites are granitic in composition and consist of unusually large crystals of quartz, feldspar, and muscovite. Feldspar is used in the production of ceramics, and muscovite is used for electrical insulation and glitter. Further, pegmatites often contain some of the least abundant elements. Thus, in addition to the common silicates, some pegmatites include semiprecious gems such as beryl, topaz, and tourmaline. Moreover, minerals containing the elements lithium, cesium, uranium, and the rare earths* are occasionally found .

Since the mid-1970s, active hot springs and metalrich sulfide deposits have been detected at several sites, including study areas along the East Pacific Rise and the Juan de Fuca Ridge.

Usually such enrichment occurs in deposits containing pyrite (FeS2), the most common and widespread sulfide mineral. Pyrite is important because when it chemically weathers, sulfuric acid forms, which enables percolating waters to dissolve the ore metals. Once dissolved, the metals gradually migrate downward through the primary ore body until they are precipitated. Deposition takes place because of changes that occur in the chemistry of the solution when it reaches the saturated zone (the zone beneath the surface where all pore spaces are filled with groundwater). In this manner, the small percentage of dispersed metal can be removed from a large volume of rock and redeposited as a higher-grade ore in a smaller volume of rock. This enrichment process is responsible for the economic success of many copper deposits, including one located in Miami, Arizona. Here the ore was upgraded from less than 1 percent copper in the primary deposit to as much as 5 percent copper in some localized zones of enrichment.

That is, many nonmetallics are used up in the process of creating other products.

As a building material, it is used not only as crushed rock and building stone but also in the making of cement.

Aggregate is produced commercially in every state and is used in nearly all building construction and in most public works projects. Besides aggregate, other important building materials include gypsum for plaster and wallboard, clay for tile and bricks, and limestone and shale, which combine to form cement. Cement and aggregate go into the making of concrete, a material that is essential to practically all construction. Aggregate gives concrete its strength and volume, and cement binds the mixture into a rock-hard substance. Building just 2 kilometers of fourlane highway requires more than 85 thousand tons of aggregate. Building an average six-room house requires 90 tons of aggregate. Because most building materials are widely distributed and present in almost unlimited quantities, they have little intrinsic value. Their economic worth comes only after the materials are removed from the ground and processed. Since their per-ton value compared with the values of metals and industrial minerals is low, mining and quarrying operations are usually undertaken to satisfy local needs.

Although supplies of industrial minerals are generally plentiful, most of these minerals are not nearly as abundant as building materials. Moreover, deposits are far more restricted in distribution and extent. As a result, many of these nonmetallic resources must be transported considerable distances, which of course adds to their cost.

Then, about 4.4 billion years ago, the magma ocean began to cool and underwent magmatic differentiation (see Chapter 4). Most of the dense minerals, olivine and pyroxene, sank, while less-dense silicate minerals floated to form the Moon\u2019s crust. The highlands are made of these igneous rocks, which rose buoyantly like \u201cscum\u201d from the crystallizing magma. The most common highland rock type is anorthosite, which is composed mainly of calcium-rich plagioclase feldspar. Once formed, the lunar crust was continually impacted as the Moon swept up debris from the solar nebula. During this time, several large impact basins were created. Then, about 3.8 billion years ago, the Moon, as well as the rest of the solar system, experienced a sudden drop in the rate of meteoritic bombardment. The Moon\u2019s next major event was the filling of the large impact basins, which had been created at least 300 million years earlier . Radiometric dating of the maria basalts puts their age between 3.0 billion and 3.5 billion years, considerably younger than the initial lunar crust. The maria basalts are thought to have originated at depths between 200 and 400 kilometers (125 and 250 miles). They were likely generated by a slow rise in temperature attributed to the decay of radioactive elements. Partial melting probably occurred in several isolated pockets, as indicated by the diverse chemical makeup of the rocks retrieved during the Apollo missions. Recent evidence suggests that some mareforming eruptions may have occurred as recently as 1 billion years ago. Other lunar surface features related to this period of volcanism include small shield volcanoes (8\u201312 kilometers [5\u20137.5 miles] in diameter), evidence of pyroclastic eruptions, rilles (narrow winding valleys thought to be lava channels), and grabens (down-faulted valleys). The last prominent features to form were rayed craters, as exemplified by the 93-kilometer-wide (56-milewide) Copernicus crater shown in Material ejected from these craters blankets the maria surfaces and many older, rayless craters. The relatively young Copernicus crater is thought to be about 1 billion years old. Had it formed on Earth, weathering and erosion would have long since obliterated it."}

Images and other data gathered by Mariner 10 show evidence of volcanism in and around Caloris Basin and a few other smaller basins. Also like our Moon, Mercury has smooth plains that cover nearly 40 percent of the area imaged by Mariner 10. Most of these smooth areas are associated with large impact basins, including Caloris Basin, where lava partially filled the basins and surrounding lowlands. Consequently, these smooth plains appear to be similar in origin to lunar maria. Recently, Messenger found evidence of volcanism by revealing thick volcanic deposits similar to those in the Columbia Basin on Earth. Researchers were also surprised by the recent detection of probable ice caps on Mercury."}

Venus also has major highlands consisting of plateaus, ridges, and topographic rises that stand above the plains.

This gigantic volcano was last active about 100 million years ago and resembles Earth\u2019s Hawaiian shield volcanoes . How did the volcanoes on Mars grow so much larger than similar structures on Earth? The largest volcanoes on the terrestrial planets tend to form where plumes of hot rock rise from deep within their interiors. On Earth, moving plates keep the crust in constant motion. Consequently, mantle plumes tend to produce a chain of volcanic structures, like the Hawaiian Islands. By contrast, plate tectonics on Mars is absent, so successive eruptions accumulate in the same location, creating enormous volcanoes rather than a string of smaller ones."}

However, poleward of about 30 degrees latitude, ice can be found within 1 meter (3 feet) of the surface. In the polar regions, it forms small permanent ice caps. Current estimates place the maximum amount of water ice held by the Martian polar ice caps at about 1.5 times the amount covering Greenland. Considerable evidence indicates that in the first 1 billion years of the planet\u2019s history, liquid water flowed on the surface, creating stream valleys and related features . One location where running water was involved in carving valleys can be seen in the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter image in Notice the stream-like banks that contain numerous teardrop-shaped islands. These valleys appear to have been cut by catastrophic floods with discharge rates that were more than 1000 times greater than those of the Mississippi River. Most of these large flood channels emerge from areas of chaotic topography that appear to have formed when the surface collapsed. The most likely source of water for these flood-created valleys was the melting of subsurface ice. If the meltwater was trapped beneath a thick layer of permafrost, pressure could mount until a catastrophic release occurred. As the water escaped, the overlying surface would collapse, creating the chaotic terrain. Not all Martian valleys appear to have resulted from water released in this manner. Some exhibit branching, tree-like patterns resembling dendritic drainage networks on Earth. In addition, the Opportunity rover investigated structures similar to features created by water on Earth\u2014 including layered sedimentary rocks, playas (salt flats), and lake beds.

More recently, the ring system was thoroughly investigated by the Galileo mission. By analyzing how these rings scatter light, researchers determined that the rings are composed of fine, dark particles similar in size to smoke particles. Furthermore, the faint nature of the rings indicates that these minute particles are widely dispersed. The main ring is composed of particles believed to be fragments blasted from the surfaces of Metis and Adrastea, two small moons of Jupiter. Impacts on Jupiter\u2019s moons Amalthea and Thebe are believed to be the source of the debris from which the outer gossamer ring formed. \n\nRequiring more than 29 Earth years to make one revolution, Saturn is almost twice as far from the Sun as Jupiter, yet their atmospheres, compositions, and internal structures are remarkably similar. The most striking feature of Saturn is its system of rings, first observed by Galileo in 1610 . Through his primitive telescope, the rings appeared as two small bodies adjacent to the planet. Their ring nature was determined 50 years later by Dutch astronomer Christian Huygens. Saturn\u2019s atmosphere, like Jupiter\u2019s, is dynamic. Although the bands of clouds are fainter and wider near the equator, rotating \u201cstorms\u201d similar to Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot occur in Saturn\u2019s atmosphere, as does intense lightning. Although the atmosphere is about 93 percent hydrogen and 3 percent helium by volume, the clouds (or condensed gases) are composed of ammonia, ammonia hydrosulfide, and water, each segregated by temperature. As on Jupiter, the dynamics of Saturn\u2019s atmosphere are driven by the heat released by gravitational compression. \n\nThe moons vary significantly in size, shape, surface age, and origin. Twenty-three of the moons are \u201coriginal\u201d satellites that formed in tandem with their parent planet. \n\nAt least 3 (Rhea, Dione, and Tethys) show evidence of tectonic activity, where internal forces have ripped apart their icy surfaces.

Saturn\u2019s largest moon, Titan, is larger than Mercury and is the second-largest satellite in the solar system. Titan and Neptune\u2019s Triton are the only satellites in the solar system known to have substantial atmospheres. Titan was visited and photographed by the CassiniHuygens probe in 2005. The atmospheric pressure at Titan\u2019s surface is about 1.5 times that at Earth\u2019s surface, and the atmospheric composition is about 98 percent nitrogen and 2 percent methane, with trace organic compounds. Titan has Earth-like landforms and geologic processes, such as dune formation and streamlike erosion caused by methane \u201crain.\u201d In addition, the northern latitudes appear to have lakes of liquid methane. Enceladus is another unique satellite of Saturn\u2014one of the few where active eruptions have been observed .

Observers saw the star \u201cwink\u201d briefly five times (meaning five rings) before the primary occultation and again five times afterward. More recent ground- and space-based observations indicate that Uranus has at least 10 sharp-edged, distinct rings orbiting its equatorial region.

Twelve years and nearly 3 billion miles of Voyager 2 travel provided investigators an amazing opportunity to view the outermost planet. Neptune has a dynamic atmosphere, much like that of the other Jovian planets . Record wind speeds exceeding 2400 kilometers (1500 miles) per hour encircle the planet, making Neptune one of the windiest places in the solar system. Neptune also exhibits large dark spots, thought to be rotating storms similar to Jupiter\u2019s Great Red Spot. However, Neptune\u2019s storms appear to have comparatively short life spans\u2014usually only a few years.

In 2006, the International Astronomical Union organized solar system objects not classified as planets or moons into two broad categories: (1) small solar system bodies, including asteroids, comets, and meteoroids, and (2) dwarf planets. The newest grouping, dwarf planets, includes Ceres, a body about 1000 kilometers (600 miles) in diameter and the largest known object in the asteroid belt, and Pluto, a former planet. \n\nThe asteroid belt The orbits of most asteroids lie between Mars and Jupiter. Also shown in red are the orbits of a few known nearEarth asteroids. \n\nOne of several hypotheses to explain the boulderstrewn topography is seismic shaking, which would cause the boulders to move upward as the finer materials sink. This is analogous to what happens when a jar of sand and various-sized pebbles is shaken: The larger pebbles rise to the top, while the smaller sand grains settle to the bottom (sometimes referred to as the Brazil nut effect). Indirect evidence from meteorites suggests that some asteroids might have been heated by a large impact causing them to differentiate into a dense iron core and a rocky mantle. In November 2005, the Japanese probe Hayabusa landed on a small near-Earth asteroid named 25143 Itokawa; it returned to Earth in June 2010. Analyzed samples suggest that the surface of the asteroid was identical in composition to meteorites and was once part of a larger asteroid. Hayabusa 2, launched in 2014, July 2018. After exploring this asteroid by digging into its surface to extract fresh samples, it is scheduled to return to Earth in 2020. \n\nHolmes The nucleus of the comet is within the bright spot in the center.

Named in honor of astronomer Gerald Kuiper, who predicted its existence, the Kuiper belt hosts comets that orbit in the outer solar system, beyond Neptune . This disc-shaped structure is thought to contain about a billion objects over 1 kilometer (0.62 mile) in size. However, most comets are too small and too distant to be observed from Earth, even using the Hubble Space Telescope. Like the asteroids in the inner solar system, most Kuiper belt comets move in slightly elliptical orbits that lie roughly in the same plane Kuiper belt comets or the gravitational influence of one of the Jovian planets occasionally alters their orbits sufficiently to send them into our view. Halley\u2019s Comet originated in the Kuiper belt. Its orbital period averages 76 years, and every one of its 29 appearances since 240 b.c.e. has been recorded, thanks to ancient Chinese astronomers\u2014testimony to their dedication as astronomical observers and the endurance of Chinese culture. In 1910, Halley\u2019s Comet made a very close approach to Earth, making for a spectacular Named for Dutch astronomer Jan Oort, the Oort cloud consists of comets that are distributed in all directions from the Sun, forming a spherical shell around the solar system. Most Oort cloud comets orbit the Sun at distances greater than 10,000 times the Earth\u2013Sun distance. The gravitational effect of a distant passing star may send an occasional Oort cloud comet into a highly eccentric orbit that carries it toward the Sun. However, only a tiny fraction of Oort cloud comets have orbits that bring them into the inner solar system. \n\nduring formation of the solar system, (2) material that is continually being ejected from the asteroid belt, or (3) the rocky and/or metallic remains of comets that once ejected by a violent asteroid impact. Before Apollo astronauts brought Moon rocks back to Earth, meteorites were the only extraterrestrial materials that could be studied in the laboratory. Meteoroids less than about 1 meter (3 feet) in diameter generally vaporize before reaching Earth\u2019s surface. Some, called micrometeorites, are so tiny and their rate of fall so slow that they drift to Earth continually as space dust. Researchers estimate that thousands of meteoroids enter Earth\u2019s atmosphere every day. After sunset on a clear, dark night, many are bright enough to be seen with the naked eye. \n\nAt least 40 terrestrial craters exhibit features that could be produced only by an explosive impact of a large asteroid or perhaps even a comet nucleus. More than 250 others may be of impact origin. Notable among them is Arizona\u2019s Meteor Crater, a huge cavity more than 1 kilometer (0.6 mile) wide and 170 meters (560 feet) deep, with an upturned rim that rises above the surrounding countryside . More than 30 tons of iron fragments have been found in the immediate area, but attempts to locate the main body have been unsuccessful. Based on the amount of erosion observed on the crater rim, the impact likely occurred within the past 50,000 years. \n\nThis enhanced color image is used to detect differences in the composition and texture of Pluto\u2019s surface The bright area in the lower-central region, sometimes referred to as \u201cthe heart of the heart\u201d is formally named Sputnik Planum and is thought to be the source of exotic ices that flowed to produce the two bluish lobes near the bottom of the image."}
