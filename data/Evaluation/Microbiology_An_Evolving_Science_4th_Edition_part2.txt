sites evades the restriction-modification screening systems of
its host?

CRISPR Interference: Adaptive
Immunity of Bacteria and Archaea

One of the most formidable wars on Earth is waged by
phages and viruses against Bacteria and Archaea, respectively. Phage predators outnumber their prokaryotic prey
10:1 and destroy between 4% and 50% of prokaryotic
life-forms. In an attempt to save themselves, Bacteria and
Archaea have developed intriguing defense systems. One
system masks receptors for phage attachment. A second
uses enzymes to digest invading phage DNA while strategically protecting their own (see the preceding discussion). The third is an adaptive system, first introduced in
Chapter 6, called CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats), in which an organism that manages to survive a phage attack captures a piece of the invader’s genome and wields it as defense against future attack.
Nearly 50% of Bacteria and 85% of Archaea possess one or
more of these CRISPR loci.

CRISPR anatomy. A CRISPR locus on a bacterial chromosome (Fig. 9.12) is composed of short direct-repeat
sequences (averaging 32 bp) separated by spacers of uniform
length (20–72 bp, depending on the species). Although the
sequences of direct repeats are, by defi nition, nearly identical, the sequences of the spacers are different from one
another. Note that repeats and spacers do not encode proteins. Near these sequence clusters lie CRISPR-associated
gene families (cas) that do encode proteins. A single species can have one or more of these cas genes, as well as
cas subtype genes (called cse for E. coli). Some CRISPR
loci also contain a set of genes called the R AMP (repeatassociated mysterious proteins) module, which includes the
gene encoding a putative polymerase.
CRISPR function. Clues about the function of the variable

spacer regions were uncovered using bioinformatics, which
revealed that some spacers bear sequence homology to bacteriophage or plasmid genes. It turned out that cells harboring these spacers were immune to the corresponding
invaders, but related species lacking these spacers were susceptible. Thus, CRISPR is perceived as a primitive microbial immune system.
How does a CRISPR locus work? Bacteria with a CRISPR
locus acquire new spacers by incorporating a piece of an

invader’s DNA (Fig. 9.13A; spacer acquisition). One or more
CRISPR Cas proteins may cleave part of an invading phage
genome and integrate it as the lead spacer in the CRISPR
region. It is then thought that the CRISPR locus is transcribed starting from an upstream leader sequence. The RNA
transcript is then cleaved and trimmed (processed) by some of
the Cas products into small RNAs composed of a single spacer
sequence (crRNA, also called guide RNA) (Fig. 9.13B;
crRNA processing stage). Each guide RNA associates with
Cas proteins to form a riboprotein complex that binds to a
homologous sequence from an infecting phage or plasmid
and directs cleavage of the foreign DNA. The process may
be aided by RAMP module proteins (Fig. 9.13C; effector
stage). As a result, the infected cell is spared destruction.
The CRISPR system has also been modified for in vivo
genetic engineering purposes (see Chapter 12). Guide RNA
molecules can be designed to direct Cas nucleases to cleave
almost any in vivo DNA sequence. CRISPR-Cas technology has gained widespread use for modifying eukaryotic
genes. Emmanuelle Charpentier, currently at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Germany, and Jennifer Doudna at UC Berkeley (Fig. 9.14) played integral
roles in deciphering the CRISPR mechanism.
Novel CRISPR functions. A number of studies have now

shown that CRISPR loci contribute to cell function
beyond providing immunity from phage infections. One
novel function of CRISPR loci, discovered from work in
George O’Toole’s Dartmouth laboratory, may be to banish
a lysogenic cell from a biofi lm, so that phage produced by
the lysogen cannot kill the rest of the biofi lm community.
Figure 9.15 demonstrates this phenomenon with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Cleavage

Figure 9.15A shows that a lysogenized (infected) cell of
P. aeruginosa does not form a biofilm. If this lysogen were
a single cell among many biofilm-producing nonlysogens,
then it would not associate with the biofilm. This self-exile
saves the biofilm from infection, should the phage become
active. The CRISPR locus is essential for this loss, since
disruption of the CRISPR or several cas genes restores a
lysogen’s ability to form biofilms (Fig. 9.15B). Introducing a wild-type copy of the gene (Fig. 9.15C) into the
mutant cell once again prevents biofilm formation. Thus,
a mechanism in which an infected cell would impose selfexile would save the population. The mechanism itself
starts with Cas3 interacting with a spacer derived from the

prophage. The interaction stimulates the emergency SOS
DNA repair system (described later), which triggers the
expression of some prophage genes that kill the cell.
Another novel function for a CRISPR-Cas system was
discovered in the lung pathogen Legionella pneumophila,
a Gram-negative bacillus that causes a pneumonia known
as Legionnaire’s disease. In 2015, twelve people in New
York City died during an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease after inhaling L. pneumophila–contaminated aerosols
emitted from a hotel rooftop air-conditioning system. The
pathogen persists in these systems by infecting amebas that
inhabit the water-cooling towers. Nicholas Cianciotto and
Felizza Gunderson at Northwestern University discovered
that intracellular L. pneumophila highly expresses several cas
genes when infecting amebas. The scientists also found that
by knocking out one of the cas genes (cas2), they could significantly limit the ability of Legionella to infect amebas.
Other components of the CRISPR system did not have
this effect. The authors hypothesize that Cas2, which is an
RNase, could modify the level or structure of another RNA
that influences or encodes factors needed for infection.
Thus, preventing cas2 expression could curtail the infection
of amebas and disrupt the pathogenesis of L. pneumophila.

Transformation is the uptake by living cells of freefloating DNA from dead, lysed cells.
Competence for transformation in some organisms is triggered by a genetically programmed physiological change.
Conjugation is a DNA transfer process mediated by a
transferable plasmid that requires cell-cell contact and
formation of a protein complex between mating cells.
Some bacteria can transfer DNA across phylogenetic
domains. For example, Agrobacterium tumefaciens conjugates with plant cells.
Transduction is the process whereby bacteriophages
transfer fragments of bacterial DNA from one bacterium to another. In generalized transduction, a phage
preparation can move any gene in a bacterial genome
to another bacterium. In specialized transduction, a
phage can move only a limited number of bacterial genes.
Restriction endonucleases protect bacteria from invasion by foreign DNA. Restriction-modification enzymes
methylate restriction target sites in the host DNA to prevent self-digestion.
The CRISPR interference system is a small interfering
RNA system in which an organism captures a piece of an
invader’s DNA and uses it to fend off future attacks.

GENES AND GENOMES

Recombination

Once a new piece of DNA enters a cell through one of the
gene exchange systems, what happens to it? The answer
depends on the nature of the acquired DNA. If the DNA is a
plasmid, capable of autonomous replication, it can coexist in
the cell separate from the host chromosome. If the DNA is
incapable of autonomous replication, however, then it may be
incorporated into the chromosome through recombination
or, as is usually the case, it may be degraded by nucleases.
Two DNA molecules in a single cell can recombine by
one of two main mechanisms: generalized or site-specific
recombination. Generalized recombination requires that
the two recombining molecules have a considerable stretch
of homologous DNA sequence. Site-specific recombination, on the other hand, requires very little sequence
homology between the recombining DNA molecules, but
it does require a short sequence (10–20 bp) recognized by
the recombination enzyme.

Generalized Recombination and RecA

Enzymes participating in generalized recombination are
able to align homologous stretches of DNA in two different DNA molecules and catalyze an exchange of strands.
The result can be a cointegrate molecule in which a single
recombination event (that is, a single crossover) joins the
two participating DNA molecules. For instance, when two
circular DNA molecules are joined by a single recombination event, the two molecules are added together and form
one large circular molecule (for an example, see Fig. 9.4). A
second crossover separated by some distance from the first,
however, will lead to an equal exchange of DNA in which
neither molecule increases in length.
Why is recombination advantageous? There are three
probable functions for generalized recombination in the
microbial cell:
■

Recombination probably fi rst evolved as an internal
method of DNA repair, useful to fi x mutations or restart
stalled replication forks. This role does not involve foreign DNA.

■

Cells with damaged chromosomes use DNA donated by
others of the same species to repair their damaged genes.

■

Recombination is part of a “self-improvement” program
that samples genes from other organisms for an ability to
enhance the competitive fitness of the cell.

The central, but by no means only, player in generalized recombination is a protein called RecA. RecA molecules are able to scan DNA molecules for homology and
align the homologous regions, forming a triplex DNA molecule, or synapse. Homologs of RecA are found in many
other species.

The clearest model of RecA-mediated recombination comes
from E. coli (Fig. 9.16 ). Before RecA can find homology
between two DNA molecules, the donor double-stranded
DNA molecule is converted to a single strand by the RecBCD
enzyme. The RecBCD complex enters at the end of a DNA
fragment and begins to unwind it (Fig. 9.16, steps 1 and
2). The complex changes activity when it encounters 8-bp
sequences called Chi (crossover hot-spot instigator) that are
scattered throughout most DNA molecules. RecBCD nicks
DNA at a Chi site and continues unwinding the strand. RecA
then loads onto the single strand as a filament (step 2).
When RecA finds homology between donor and recipient DNA (the minimum required is about 50 bp), the
donor single-stranded DNA invades the homologous
region in the double-stranded DNA recipient molecule and
displaces its like strand. The process is called strand invasion (Fig. 9.16, step 3). At this point, a single-strand crossover has been made. The single-strand crossover produces a
molecule with four double-stranded ends.
Other recombination proteins, RuvA and RuvB, assemble
at the crossover point and extend the invasion in a process
called “strand assimilation” or branch migration (Fig. 9.16,
step 4 and blowup). RuvAB proteins pull matched hybrid
strands in opposite directions, thereby extending the basepairing between homologous donor and recipient strands.
Ultimately, the end of the displaced recipient strand is
cleaved (Fig. 9.16, step 5) and ligated to the donor strand
(step 6). The resulting structure is known as a Holliday junction, after the scientist (Robin Holliday) who first proposed
it (step 7; also seen in the blowup). The final step is resolution
of the crossover Holliday junction. To visualize this, we mentally rotate the right half of the Holliday structure as shown
in Figure 9.16, step 7. RuvC protein cleaves across the junction (step 8), and the products are ligated to form a complete
crossover. The ligated product represents a true crossover. In
each case, notice that a small heteroduplex region is formed
in which one strand comes from the donor and the complementary region comes from the recipient.
If we were viewing the end result of transduction, where
the recipient is a circular chromosome and the donor is a
double-stranded linear fragment, the recombinant molecule would appear as shown in Figure 9.16, step 9. A
second crossover farther along the donor strand is then
required to maintain circular integrity of the recipient (step
10). This double crossover means that any genes residing
between the first and second crossovers are simultaneously
exchanged and are said to be genetically linked.
Thought Question

9.5 In a transductional cross between an A+B+C+ genotype

donor and an A– B – C– genotype recipient, 100 A+ recombinants were selected. Of those 100, 15% were also B+, while
75% were C+. Is gene B or gene C closer to gene A?

radiation-resistant species Deinococcus radiodurans, for example, does the exact opposite. Its RecA first binds dsDNA and
then searches ssDNA for homology. This inverse DNA strand
exchange accounts, in part, for the remarkable radiation
resistance of this microbe (read more about it in eTopic 9.3).

Site-Specific Recombination
Is RecA Independent

In contrast to generalized recombination mechanisms
that require RecA protein and can recombine any region
of the chromosome, site-specific recombination does not
utilize RecA and moves only a limited number of genes.
This form of recombination involves very short regions
of homology between donor and target DNA molecules.
Dedicated enzyme systems specifically recognize those
sequences and catalyze a crossover between them to produce a cointegrate molecule. The integration of phage
lambda, described earlier, is one example of site-specific
recombination involving a 15-bp att site and the integrase
enzyme (see Fig. 9.8).
Other examples of site-specific recombination are
flagellar phase variation in the pathogen Salmonella
enterica and phase variation in the expression of type
I pili in E. coli. In these systems, a segment of DNA is
inverted (flipped) at a low frequency, resulting in the onor-off regulation of adjacent gene expression. Phase variation is frequently employed by pathogens to evade the
host immune system by changing the expression of cellsurface proteins. For more on flagellar phase variation,
see Section 10.1.

Recombination is the process by which DNA sequences
can be exchanged between DNA molecules.
General recombination involves large regions of sequence
homology between recombining DNA molecules.
RecA protein mediates generalized recombination.
The extremely radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans is thought to use RecA protein to patch together
homologous ends of fragmented DNA in a way that reconstructs the chromosome after extreme radiation damage.
Site-specific recombination requires little homology
between donor and recipient DNA molecules. Site-specific recombination enables phage DNA to integrate into
bacterial chromosomes and is a process that can turn on
or turn off certain genes, as in flagellar phase variation in
Salmonella.

9.3

Mutations

What are mutations, and how do they affect evolution?
Any permanent, heritable alteration in a DNA sequence,
whether harmful, beneficial, or neutral, is called a mutation. Two basic requirements are needed to produce a heritable mutation: Namely, there must be a change in the base
sequence, and the cell must fail to repair the change before
the next round of replication. Repair mechanisms will be
discussed in Section 9.4. Although it is tempting to think
that all mutations destroy a protein’s activity, this is not the
case. A given mutation may or may not affect the informational content or phenotype of the organism.
Mutations come in several different physical and structural forms:
■

A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide
(Fig. 9.17A and B). Changing a purine to a different
purine or a pyrimidine to a different pyrimidine is called
a transition. Swapping a purine for a pyrimidine (or vice
versa) is a transversion.

■

Insertions and deletions involve, respectively, the
addition or subtraction of one or more nucleotides
(Fig. 9.17C and D), making the sequence either longer
or shorter than it was originally.

■

An inversion results when a fragment of DNA is flipped in
orientation relative to DNA on either side (Fig. 9.17E).

■

A reversion restores a sequence altered by mutation to
its original sequence.

Mutations can also be categorized into several informational classes (refer to Figure 8.10 for the genetic code).
Mutations that do not change the amino acid sequence of
a translated open reading frame (ORF) are called silent
mutations. For example, a point mutation changing TTT
to TTC in the sense DNA strand (corresponding to a UUUto-UUC codon change in mRNA) still codes for phenylalanine. Thus, even though the DNA sequence has changed,
the protein sequence remains the same (a synonymous substitution). However, if the UUU codon were changed to
UUA (a U-to-A transversion), then the protein would have
a leucine where a phenylalanine had been (see Fig. 9.17A).
This type of mutation is a missense mutation because the
amino acid sequence of the protein has changed. (Remember: RNA polymerase makes mRNA by reading the DNA
template strand, while the complementary, or sense, DNA
strand has the same sequence as the mRNA.)
The amino acid substitution resulting from a missense
mutation may or may not alter protein function. The outcome
depends on the structural importance of the original amino
acid and how close in structure the replacement amino acid is
to the original. Missense mutations result in either conservative amino acid replacements, in which the new amino acid

is structurally similar to the original (for example, leucine is
substituted for isoleucine), or nonconservative replacements,
in which a very different amino acid is substituted (for example, tyrosine for alanine). A missense change may decrease
or eliminate the activity of the protein (a loss-of-function
mutation), or it may make the protein more active. It could
even gain a new activity, such as an expanded substrate specificity or a completely different substrate specificity (these are
called gain-of-function mutations).
A mutation that eliminates function is known as a
knockout mutation (see Fig. 9.17B). Knockout mutations can include multiple-base insertions and deletions,
as well as nonsense mutations. A nonsense mutation is a
point mutation that changes an amino acid codon into a

translation termination codon—for example, UCA (serine) to UAA. The result will be a truncated protein most
likely lacking any function—another example of a knockout mutation. Typically, these defective, truncated proteins
are degraded by cellular proteases (see Section 8.4).
Insertions and deletions can alter the reading frame
of the DNA sequence (see Fig. 9.17C and D). Remarkable as it is, the ribosome simply reads RNA sequences one
codon at a time, stringing amino acids together in the process. It translates each codon “word” but cannot understand the overall protein “sentence.” It does not recognize
when bases have been added or removed through mutation; instead, it keeps reading the sequence in triplets. If
the number of bases inserted or deleted is not a multiple of
three, the ribosome will read the wrong triplets. The result
is a frameshift mutation, which produces a garbled protein “sentence.” Frameshift mutations often cause the ribosome to encounter a premature stop codon, originally in a
different reading frame. If the insertion or deletion involves
multiples of three bases, the reading frame is not changed,
but one or more amino acids are added or removed.
An inversion mutation flips a DNA sequence (see
Fig. 9.17E). Imagine the sequence highlighted in the figure rotating 180° while the adjacent sequences (in black)
remain right where they are. The rotation would retain the
5′-to-3′ polarity in the new molecule. But if the inversion
occurred within a gene, it would likely change the codons
in the area and alter the resulting protein. What Figure 9.17E shows is a small inversion; however, inversions
often involve large tracts of DNA encompassing several
genes. If an entire gene with its promoter inverts, the gene
will likely remain functional, and its encoded protein may
very well still be made. Inversions occur within a genome
as a result of recombination events between similar DNA
sequences or as a consequence of mobile genetic elements
jumping between different areas of a genome.
Mutations can affect both the genotype and the phenotype of an organism. The genotype of an organism reflects
its genomic sequences. Regardless of whether a mutation
causes a change in a biochemical trait (phenotype), every
mutation causes a change in the genotype. In contrast to
genotype, phenotype comprises only observable characteristics, such as biochemical, morphological, or growth traits.
For instance, the product of argA allows an organism to
make enough arginine to support growth in media devoid
of arginine. Any mutation in argA is a genotypic change,
but if the result is a synonymous amino acid substitution,
then there is no phenotypic change; the organism can still
make its own arginine. However, if the mutation destroys
the activity of the argA product, then the microbe can no
longer make arginine, and the amino acid must be supplied
in the medium. This is a phenotypic change, too. A mutant
that has lost the ability to synthesize a substance required
for growth is called an auxotroph.

X-rays and gamma rays

It is also important to realize that small mutations (such as
a single base substitution) can have large effects on phenotype,
whereas large mutations (such as the insertion of a 5-kb transposon between two genes) may have little or no effect. To
illustrate, consider that a single point mutation in the hpr gene
of the phosphotransferase sugar transport system (discussed in
Section 4.2 and eTopic 4.1) will render a bacterium incapable
of growing on many sugars, but inserting 5 kb of DNA just
past the hpr stop codon will have no effect on cell growth. For
mutations, it’s often not the size that counts; it’s the location.

Mutations Arise by Diverse Mechanisms

DNA is susceptible to damage inflicted by a variety of physical and chemical agents. For example, irradiation by X-rays
can cause a massive number of DNA strand breaks. When
this happens, the integrity of the chromosome is lost and the
cell dies. Other agents can directly modify the bases in DNA
while leaving its overall structure intact. In this case, the modified bases have altered hydrogen bond base-pairing properties
that result in the incorporation of an inappropriate base during replication. When that happens, a mutation results.

amino group shifts to an imino ( NH) group, for example,
then base-pairing changes. A cytosine that normally basepairs with guanine will, in its rare imino form, base-pair with
adenine. Tautomeric shifts that occur during DNA replication
will increase the number of mutational events. Even though
the replication apparatus is very accurate with various proofreading and repair functions, such as the 3′-to-5′ exonuclease
activity of DNA polymerase III (see the discussion of DnaQ
in Section 7.3), mistakes do occur, albeit at a very low rate.
Besides misincorporation mistakes, naturally occurring
intracellular chemical reactions with water can damage DNA.
These endogenous reactions are an important source of spontaneous mutations. For example, cytosine spontaneously
deaminates to yield uracil (Fig. 9.19). The result is a GCto-AT transition. In addition, purines are particularly susceptible to spontaneous loss from DNA via breakage of the
glycosidic bond connecting the base to the sugar backbone
(Fig. 9.20). The result of this loss is the formation of an apurinic site (one missing a purine base) in the DNA. Lack of a
purine would obviously hinder transcription and replication.

DNA can also be damaged by metabolic activities of the
cell that produce reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen
peroxide (H 2O2), superoxide radicals (•O2 –), and hydroxyl
radicals (•OH). Even though bacteria have biochemical
mechanisms to detoxify reactive oxygen species, the systems can be overwhelmed. Oxidative damage causes the
production of thymidine glycol or 8-oxo-7-hydrodeoxyguanosine in DNA (Fig. 9.21).
Naturally occurring intracellular methylation agents (for
example, S-adenosylmethionine) can spontaneously methylate DNA to produce a variety of altered bases. The spontaneous methylation of the N-7 position of guanine, for
example, weakens the glycosidic bond and spontaneously releases the base (forming an apurinic
site) or opens the imidazole ring (formGuanine

absorbed by a pyrimidine hit with UV light boosts the energy
of its electrons to the point where the molecule is unstable.
If two pyrimidines are neighbors on a single DNA strand,
their energized electrons can react to form a four-membered
cyclobutane ring. The result is a pyrimidine dimer that will
block replication and transcription (Fig. 9.22).
Although DNA can be damaged in numerous ways,
the cell can repair that damage before it becomes fixed
as a mutation. But the repair mechanisms are not perfect.
Repair errors contribute heavily to the formation of heritable mutations and, thus, to evolution. Although most mutations decrease the fitness of a species, some can improve
fitness by, among other things, enabling an organism to
more efficiently use or compete for available food sources.

Mutation Rates and Frequencies

The mutation rate for a given gene is often defined
as the number of mutations formed per cell division. Since
the number of cells in a typical culture starts out very low
and grows to a very high density, the number of cell divisions is approximately equal to the number of cells in the
culture. For example, to go from one cell to eight cells
requires seven cell divisions (not generations). Mutation
rate can be estimated according to the formula a = m per
number of cell divisions, where a is the mutation rate and
m is the number of mutations that occur as the number

FIGURE 9.23

■ Sectored colonies of bacteria.
This E. coli
mutator strain is a lactose-negative mutant that does not ferment
lactose and thus does not turn the indicator blue. But because the
strain has a mutation in one of the mutator genes, there is a high
rate of reversion to the lactose fermenter strain, which shows up as
blue papillae on the white colony.

of cells increases from N 0 to N. Thus, a culture growing
from 103 (1,000) cells to 107 (10,000,000) cells requires
approximately 107 cell divisions (10,000,000 – 1,000 =
9,999,000 cell divisions). If 10 mutants developed in a
specific gene, then the mutation rate would be approximately 10/107 = 1 × 10 –6. More on mutation rate can be
found in eTopic 9.4.

Note:

Distinguish between the number of cell divisions, the number of generations, and the number of cell generations. For instance,
the replication of 1,000 cells to give 2,000 cells requires 1,000 cell
divisions but takes place over only one generation (meaning one doubling). You will sometimes see the phrase mutation rate “per cell generation,” which is essentially equivalent to “per cell division.”

A less complicated calculation is mutation frequency.
Mutation frequency tells us how many mutant cells are
present in a population. It is calculated simply as the ratio
of mutants per total cells in the population.
The colonies in Figure 9.23 graphically illustrate the
result of a high mutation rate. The example shows an E.
coli mutator strain that has a point mutation in the lactose
operon. It will not ferment lactose. The medium contains
lactose and peptides as carbon sources, and an indicator
that turns blue if the organism can ferment lactose. This
medium helps scientists follow the development of mutations in the gene needed to ferment lactose. Because the
original cell in this case was Lac– (due to a mutation in that
gene), most of the colony is white. However, the strain is
a mutator strain defective in a DNA repair gene (see Section 9.4). This defect causes a high rate of reversion to Lac+.

Each papilla represents a separate mutational event.
Thought Question

9.6 You have been asked to calculate the mutation rate for

a gene in Salmonella enterica, so you dilute an 18-hour broth
culture to 1 × 104 cells/ml and let it grow to 1 × 109 cells/ml. At
that point you dilute and plate cells on the appropriate agar
medium and estimate that there were 10,000,000 mutants in
the culture. What you don’t know is that the original dilution of
1 × 104 cells/ml already had 10 mutants defective in that gene.
Does the presence of those 10 mutants affect your estimate
of the mutation rate? If so, then how?

Identifying Mutagens Using
Bacterial “Guinea Pigs”

In a world where we are continually exposed to new
chemicals, it is important to determine which chemicals
are potential mutagens. Bruce Ames and his colleagues
invented a simple alternative that uses bacteria as a rapid
initial screen, for which Ames received the National Medal
of Science in 1998. The method, called the Ames test,
relies on a mutant of Salmonella enterica that is defective in
the hisG gene, whose product is involved in histidine biosynthesis (Fig. 9.24). The hisG mutant cannot grow on a
minimal defined medium lacking histidine. However, if a
reversion mutation occurs in the hisG gene and restores the
gene to its original functional state (phenotypic reversion),

A hisG auxotrophic mutant of
Salmonella enterica will not
grow on histidine-free medium.

the new mutant cell will form a colony even in the absence
of histidine. This method is called a reversion test.
Ames used this his reversion test to screen compounds
for potential mutagenicity. If a chemical can mutate one
gene (hisG), it can potentially affect any gene. As shown
in Figure 9.24, a mutagen-containing disk is placed in the
middle of an agar plate spread with the original his mutant.
As the mutagen diffuses into the medium and causes reversion mutations, colonies start to appear, forming a ring
around the disk. The longer the plate is incubated, the
more revertants are produced.
The plate reversion test goes only so far, however. The
technique will not expose potential mutagens that require
processing by mammalian enzymes to become mutagenic. In
humans, many nonmutagenic chemicals can be transformed
into potent mutagens by the liver. The liver is the chief organ
for detoxifying the body—a task that liver enzymes accomplish by chemically modifying foreign substances. To expose
the mutagenic potential of a chemical, the chemical is treated
with a rat liver extract before the mixture is applied to bacteria for the his reversion test (Fig. 9.25). If the enzymes of

be seen on any plate.

the liver convert the compound to a mutagen (they do this
accidentally, not on purpose), then His+ revertant colonies
will be seen. This method accelerates the process of drug
discovery by providing an inexpensive preliminary screen
for weeding out mutagenic chemicals before more expensive
animal testing is undertaken.
More involved assays for mutagenicity involve transgenic
mice. Mice are engineered to have the bacterial lacZ gene,
for instance, inserted into their chromosomes. The lacZ
gene encodes an enzyme that is easily assayed, so it is useful as a reporter for mutagenic activity. This reporter gene
will be distributed throughout the mouse in all organs. A
potential mutagen is administered to the mouse, and after
some time the mouse is sacrificed, its organs are removed,
and the DNA is extracted and examined for mutations arising in the lacZ gene. This approach allows scientists to
track where the mutagen is distributed in the mouse and to
determine whether certain organs convert harmless precursor chemicals into dangerous mutagenic compounds.

To Summarize

■

A mutation is any heritable change in DNA sequence,
regardless of whether a change in gene function results.
Genotype reflects the genetic makeup of an organism,
whereas phenotype reflects its physical traits.
Classes of mutations include silent mutations, missense
mutations, nonsense mutations, point mutations, insertions, deletions, and frameshift mutations.
Spontaneous mutations reflect tautomeric shifts in
DNA nucleotides during replication, accidental incorporation of noncomplementary nucleotides during

replication, or “natural” levels of chemical or physical
(irradiation) mutagens in the environment.

Chemical mutagens can alter purine and pyrimidine
structure and change base-pairing properties.
The mutagenicity of a chemical can be assessed by its
effect on bacterial cultures.

9.4

DNA Repair

Microorganisms are equipped with a variety of molecular
tools that repair DNA damage before the damage becomes
a heritable mutation (see Table 9.3). The type of repair
mechanism used (and when it is used) depends on two
things: the type of mutation needing repair and the extent
of damage. Some repair mechanisms are error proof and do
not introduce mutations; others are error prone and require
“emergency” DNA polymerases expressed under dire circumstances. These polymerases sacrifice replication accuracy to rescue the damaged genome. Whether damage is
introduced by mutagens or by inaccurate DNA synthesis,
microbial survival depends on the ability to repair DNA.
We will first discuss the error-proof repair pathways
that prevent mutations. These include methyl mismatch
repair, photoreactivation, nucleotide excision repair, base
excision repair, and recombinational repair. Then we will
turn our attention to error-prone repair pathways. These
pathways risk introducing mutations and operate only
when damage is so severe that the cell has no other choice
but to die. Realize that many repair enzymes are in short
supply. Special Topic 9.1 describes a new DNA wire model
for how some important DNA repair enzymes locate DNA
damage.

Error-Proof Repair Pathways

Methyl mismatch repair. What happens if DNA poly-

merase simply makes a mistake and incorporates a normal
but incorrect base? The inherent error rate of DNA polymerase III is approximately one mistake per 108 bases synthesized, after proofreading. However, the mutation rate
in a live cell is actually only 10 –10 per base pair replicated.
But how can a cell repair a mutation after it has already
been introduced during replication? One method is methyl
mismatch repair, which is based on repair enzymes recognizing the methylation pattern in DNA bases. As discussed in Section 7.3, many bacteria tag their parental
DNA by methylating it at specific sites. In E. coli, for example, deoxyadenosine methylase (Dam) methylates the palindromic sequence GATC to produce GA METC. The Dam
methylase does this soon, but not immediately, after replication of a DNA sequence.
Misincorporation of a base during replication produces a
mismatch between the incorrect base in the newly synthesized but unmethylated strand and the correct base residing
in the parental, methylated strand. Methyl-directed mismatch repair enzymes (MutS, MutL, and MutH) bind to
the mismatch. MutS first binds to the mismatch and recruits
MutL and MutH (Fig. 9.26 , steps 1 and 2). MutL recognizes the methylated strand (GA METC) and brings it in a
loop to meet MutS and MutH (steps 3 and 4). Then, MutH
cleaves the unmethylated strand containing the mutation,
near the GATC sequence (step 5). A DNA helicase called
UvrD then unwinds the cleaved strand, exposing it to a variety of exonucleases (step 6). The result is a gap that is filled
in by DNA polymerase I (Pol I) and sealed by DNA ligase.
The methyl-directed mismatch repair proteins (and
genes) are called Mut (and mut) because a high mutation
rate results in strains that are defective in one of these proteins. A bacterial strain with a high mutation rate is called
a mutator strain.

Not all DNA methylations signal methyl mismatch repair.
DNA methylation by restriction-modification systems, for example,
prevents cleavage by DNA restriction endonucleases, but is not
used to designate parental DNA after replication.

repair mechanisms do not distinguish between parental
and newly synthesized strands. Many microbes in the environment commonly encounter ultraviolet light. The pyrimidine dimers that form as a result of ultraviolet irradiation

9.7 During transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a

single strand of donor DNA is transferred into the recipient.
This single strand of DNA can be recombined into the recipient’s genome at the homologous area. However, if the segment
of recipient DNA had a mutation in it relative to the donor DNA
strand, then the result would be a mismatch after recombination. Explain how, in the face of mismatch repair, the recipient
cell ever retains the wild-type sequence from the donor.

The bacterial cell, in
this case E. coli, can use specific methylations on DNA to recognize
parental DNA strands for preferential DNA repair. Newly replicated
strands are not immediately methylated. So, when a mismatch is
found, the mismatch repair system views the newly synthesized
strand as suspect and replaces the section of unmethylated DNA encompassing the mismatch. The steps following cleavage are similar
to what is shown in Figure 9.27 (steps 7 and 8).

GENES AND GENOMES

How do DNA repair proteins find DNA damage? Do they randomly float in the cytoplasm until they happen to bump into
an abasic site or a mispaired base? Or do they bind DNA and
slide along its length until running into something? Jacqueline Barton from the California Institute of Technology (Fig. 1)
thinks that neither option is likely for repair proteins containing [4Fe-4S] groups. The [4Fe-4S] group is a tetrahedral cluster (Fig. 2, inset) with important roles in oxidation-reduction
chemistry involving electron transfer. The position of [4Fe4S] clusters in proteins is coordinated by four cysteine residues that bind to the Fe molecules.
How might a redox center help repair proteins locate DNA
damage? Many DNA repair enzymes are in very short supply.
The DNA glycosylase MutY in E. coli, for instance, is present
at only about 30 proteins per cell. It would take a long time
for those few molecules to scan that much DNA. It would
be nice if different repair proteins could collaborate in some
way to scan large stretches of DNA for defects. Barton and
her collaborators think that is exactly what happens. Their

The stacked core of aromatic bases that extends down
the helical axis of DNA allows DNA to conduct electrons, but
only if the DNA is intact. DNA damage destroys the integrity
of the wire. Repair proteins with [4Fe-4S] clusters that bind
DNA can pass an electron along an undamaged DNA “wire” (a
process called DNA charge transport, or CT) to another protein with a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Here is how the model works

an InvA strain carrying an Endo III protein that retains CT

InvA strain without Endo III or that carried Endo III lacking
CT function would not grow (tubes 2, 3, and 4). The endonuclease catalytic activity of Endo III, however, would not be

can be repaired by a light-activated mechanism called photoreactivation. In photoreactivation, the enzyme photolyase binds to the dimer and cleaves the cyclobutane
ring linking the two adjacent, damaged nucleotides. The
damage is repaired without any bases being excised.
While photolyase is specific for pyrimidine dimer repair
and requires light, a system called nucleotide excision
repair (NER) operates in the dark (or light) and is used
to excise other kinds of damaged DNA, as well as pyrimidine dimers. In this system, a three-subunit endonuclease (UvrABC) excises a patch of 12–13 nucleotides that
includes the dimer (Fig. 9.27 ). The basic mechanism
involves UvrA, associated with UvrB, recognizing the damaged base (Fig. 9.27, steps 1–3). UvrA is ejected (step 4),
and UvrB binds UvrC (step 5), which actually cleaves the damaged strand at two sites flanking the damaged base (step 6).
The small fragment is removed, and the gap is repaired
by DNA polymerase I (steps 7 and 8). Besides pyrimidine
dimers, NER can repair damage such as O 6 -methylguanine, N 2-guanine, N 3-adenine, and other modified bases
that significantly alter base pairing and helix conformation.
Nucleotide excision repair is also used to excise other kinds
of damaged DNA besides pyrimidine dimers.
Nucleotide excision repair can be enhanced by ongoing
RNA transcription. Bacteria and eukaryotic cells preferentially repair genes that are being transcribed. The preferential repair of transcriptionally active genes makes sense,
since a cell unable to transcribe such a gene because of
recent DNA damage would be at a survival disadvantage.
An RNA polymerase that encounters a UV dimer or other
unrecognizable base on a template DNA strand will stall
during transcription. The stalled RNA polymerase is then
recognized by a protein that mediates a process called transcription-coupled repair (TCR). One TCR pathway dislodges RNA polymerase (Mfd dependent); the other pushes
RNA polymerase back from the lesion (UvrD and NusA
dependent). The transcription-coupled repair protein then
snares a nearby UvrAB to begin nucleotide excision repair.
Base excision repair snips damaged bases from DNA.

Although nucleotide excision repair can recognize and repair
several types of damage, it does not work in all instances.
Another error-proof process, known as base excision repair
(BER), employs a battery of glycosylase enzymes that can
recognize and clip certain damaged bases from the phosphodiester backbone. Uracil DNA glycosylase, hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase, and 3-methyladenine glycosylase
recognize, respectively, uracil, hypoxanthine, and 3-methyladenine when these bases are present in DNA. Uracil
can be found in DNA either as a spontaneous deamination
product of cytosine (see Fig. 9.19) or as a result of inappropriate incorporation during replication. Spontaneous deamination of adenine residues produces hypoxanthine. Uracil

lead to mutations. Mutagens such as methyl methanesulfonate can alkylate adenine to produce the adduct 3-methyladenine. A 3-methyladenine residue will totally block DNA
replication, making this a lethal form of damage. Consequently, repairing these mutations is vital for survival.

The site is called an AP site because it is missing either

downstream of the AP site and at the same time synthesize

Thought Question

9.8 It has been reported that hypermutable bacterial strains are overrepresented in clinical isolates.
Out of 500 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, for
example, 2%–3% were mutator strains having mutation rates 100–1,000 times higher than lab reference
strains. Why might mutator strains be beneficial to
pathogens?

All of the repair processes described thus far (mismatch
repair, photoreactivation, nucleotide excision repair, and
base excision repair) are error-proof pathways that rely on
the presence of a good template strand opposite the damaged strand. Replication of the template strand is used to
replace the damaged bases accurately. But what happens when both strands are damaged or when there
is only one strand?
Recombinational repair. Figure 9.29 illustrates one

I. Recombinational repair is not limited to pyrimidine
dimers. It will work on any damage that causes gaps during replication.

Error-Prone DNA Repair

SOS (“Save Our Ship”) repair. When DNA damage is
extensive, repair strategies that excise pieces of DNA or that
require recombination will destroy the circularity of the
chromosome and kill the cell. To save the chromosome,
and itself, the cell must take more drastic measures and
induce the SOS response, a system that introduces mutations into severely damaged DNA. The cell relaxes replication fidelity to maintain a circular chromosome even
if incorrect bases are introduced. In the SOS system, the
RecA protein, normally located at the cell poles, senses the
extent of DNA damage by monitoring the level of singlestranded DNA produced. For example, excessive ultraviolet
irradiation produces numerous ssDNA gaps because DNA
polymerase cannot replicate through pyrimidine dimers.
RecA interacts with the ssDNA and disengages from the
poles.
Formation of RecA filaments (see Fig. 9.16, step 2) on
ssDNA activates a second function of RecA, called coprotease activity, that stimulates autodigestion of the LexA
repressor, a protein that normally prevents SOS activation. LexA protein binds to the promoters of DNA repair
genes and prevents their transcription (Fig. 9.30A and B).
Cleavage of LexA then unleashes the production of DNA
repair enzymes. Among these enzymes are two “sloppy”
DNA polymerases that lack proofreading activity: DinB
(also called DNA polymerase IV, or Pol IV) and UmuDC
(also called DNA polymerase V, or Pol V) (Fig. 9.30C).
The UmuDC enzyme is perfect for replicating through
damaged bases (a process called translesion bypass replication) because it sacrifices accuracy for continuity. When
the enzyme encounters an undecipherable damaged base,
it will insert whatever nucleotide is available. The result,
of course, will be numerous permanent mutations, but the
benefit is that the cell has a chance to live if it can tolerate
the mutations. The choice really is “mutate or die,” because
housekeeping DNA polymerases like Pol III cannot move
through damaged DNA. (Note that the term “housekeeping” is applied to proteins or enzymes that keep the cell
running at all times.)
When the cell is severely compromised by mutation,
it temporarily stops dividing. Like a pit stop during an
auto race, this pause in cell division allows time for repair
enzymes to fix the damage. The product of another SOSregulated gene, called sulA, causes this pause by binding
to the FtsZ cell division protein, keeping it from initiating cell division (see Sections 3.1 and 3.4). Once the damage has been repaired, RecA coprotease is inactivated
and LexA repressor accumulates, turning off all the SOS
genes, including sulA. The lingering SulA protein is then
degraded by a protease called Lon. The protein is called

of different mechanisms that collaborate to rescue the cell.

Lon because when it is missing, SulA inappropriately accumulates, inhibits cell division, and produces long filamentous cells.
The coprotease activity of RecA can also activate prophages by stimulating autocleavage of proteins that prevent phage replication. This phenomenon is used by some
organisms to displace competitors in an environmental
niche. For instance, Streptococcus pneumoniae, a cause of
pneumonia, displaces Staphylococcus aureus in the human
nasopharynx by producing hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen
peroxide damages S. aureus DNA, which activates the SOS

response and triggers replication of resident bacteriophages
that lyse the cell. The loss of Staphylococcus aureus means
more room for Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Nonhomologous end joining. Double-strand breaks in
DNA are particularly dangerous to a cell because the loss
of chromosome integrity is immediate. In rapidly growing bacteria such as E. coli, double-strand breaks can be
repaired by homologous recombination as long as another
copy of the chromosome is present to guide the repair.
But in slow-growing bacteria such as Mycobacterium

repair system. In humans, the ancestor of mutS evolved to
have multiple repair functions, as well as to participate in
postmeiotic segregation. Defects in this repair mechanism
have been linked to increased risk of certain colon cancers. Numerous other human genetic diseases are caused
by mutations in homologs of bacterial repair genes. For
example, defective excision repair genes in humans cause
xeroderma pigmentosum, a disease that that leads to blindness and skin cancers. A deficiency in transcription-coupled

break and recruits LigD, a protein with polymerase and 3′
exonuclease activities that fill in or remove single-strand
overhangs, and a ligase activity that joins two doublestrand breaks. Because the system does not require homology, it can be error prone, causing the loss or addition of
a few nucleotides at the break site or even the joining of
two previously unlinked DNA molecules. NHEJ has been
reported in Mycobacterium and Bacillus species.

Methyl mismatch repair uses methylation of the parental DNA strand to distinguish it from newly replicated

Photoreactivation cleaves the cyclobutane rings of
pyrimidine dimers.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) clips out a patch of
single-stranded DNA containing certain types of damaged bases.
Base excision repair (BER) excises structurally altered
bases without cleaving the phosphodiester backbone.
The resulting AP (apurinic or apyrimidinic) site is targeted by AP nucleases.
Recombinational repair takes place at a replication
fork. A “good” strand of DNA is used to replace a
homologous damaged strand.
Extensive DNA damage leads to induction of the
SOS response, producing increased levels of the errorproof repair systems, as well as error-prone translesion
bypass DNA polymerases that introduce mutations.

to the target DNA, forming a transpososome complex
(Fig. 9.34
, step 1). The transposase cuts the phosphodiester backbone (step 2), severing one strand at one end
of the insertion sequence and the other strand at the other
end. The 3′ OH ends of the IS element then attack the
unnicked strands in a transesterification reaction that produces hairpin structures (step 3). In this instance, joining
the ends of the double-stranded molecule produces a single
strand with a hairpin.
After the host carrier DNA is ejected from the transpososome, the hairpin ends are renicked and the 3′ OH ends
attack the target DNA molecule in a staggered manner
(Fig. 9.34, step 4). The element has successfully “jumped”
from one molecule to another without replicating. Note
that the target DNA segment replicates as a result of the
insertion process, thereby producing a copy of the target
sequence at each end of the IS element (step 5).
Nonreplicative transposition is carried out by insertion sequence elements and by composite transposons. A
composite transposon typically consists of two insertion
sequences that flank an antibiotic resistance gene, or one
or more catabolic genes (for example, genes for benzene
catabolism). Often the interior inverted repeats of the IS
elements have degenerated, so the transposase acts on primarily the two outermost inverted repeats, causing the
whole transposon to move as one unit. Tn10 is one such
example (Fig. 9.35).
In contrast to composite transposons, replicative transposition is typically observed with complex transposons, such
as the Tn3 family of transposons (Fig. 9.36A). Tn3 not only
possesses transposase and antibiotic resistance genes, but
also includes a gene whose product is called resolvase. The
transposase acts on the inverted-repeat ends of the element,
causing simultaneous replication and insertion of the transposon into target DNA. Replicative transposition produces
a cointegrate between two different DNA molecules, one of
which was the source of the transposon (Fig. 9.36B). As a
result of transposition and replication, the cointegrate molecule will contain two copies of the element flanking the integrated plasmid. Resolvase is a site-specific recombinase that
mediates recombination between the duplicated transposons
at the internal Tn3 res sites. The result of this recombination
is restoration of the two original circular replicons, each one
now containing a copy of the transposon.

absence of tetracycline, only a few cells in a population may
have Tn916. However, the presence of just a small amount
of tetracycline triggers conjugative transfer of the element,
spreading it throughout the population.
The study of transposons may provide insight into the
workings of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
which causes AIDS. The structure of transposase from
transposon Tn5 bears a striking similarity to the HIV integrase needed to embed the reverse-transcribed HIV viral

type of mobile element, called an integron, has evolved in
bacteria to capture DNA cassettes that encode antibiotic
resistance genes (see eTopic 9.5).

Thought Question

■

9.9 Diagram how a composite transposon like Tn10 can

generate inversions or deletions in target DNA during transposition. Hint: This happens when transposition within the
chromosome occurs using the inverted repeats closest to
the tetracycline resistance gene (see Fig. 9.35). If you draw it
right, you will see, in the end, that the tetracycline resistance
gene is lost.

All of the transposition events mentioned so far involve
transfer between DNA molecules within the same cell. Some
transposons, called conjugative transposons, are able to
transfer from one cell to another by conjugation. One example is the transposon Tn916 of Enterococcus, which encodes
tetracycline resistance. These conjugative transposons excise
from donor DNA and form a circular intermediate, like a
plasmid, just prior to conjugation, but they do not replicate
autonomously. They must be part of a larger self-replicating
DNA entity (for example, plasmid, chromosome, or phage).
Once transferred into a new host, the conjugative transposon integrates into the recipient’s chromosome. Tn916
and some other conjugative transposons evolved to transfer when a population is facing danger. For example, in the

(“jumping genes”) move from one DNA molecule to
another, usually without replicating separately (that is,
they are not plasmids).
Transposase is an enzyme that forms a transpososome
complex with the transposable element and target DNAs.
Insertion sequences are simple DNA transposable elements containing a transposase gene flanked by short
inverted-repeat sequences.
Transposable elements move by nonreplicative or replicative mechanisms.
Transposons are complex transposable elements carrying
additional genes (encoding, for example, drug resistance).
Composite transposons have two duplicate insertion
sequence elements that flank additional genes. Often
the interior inverted repeats of these elements contain
mutations.
Transposons can carry a variety of genes, including
antibiotic resistance genes.

Genome Evolution

Can bacterial genes evolve to become part of eukaryotic
genomes—and vice versa? A sense of evolution, of what went
before, pervades efforts to understand microbial genomes.
Genes can be removed (deletion), added (insertion), rearranged (recombination), or divided to the point where the
genome bears only a slight resemblance to what it once was.
The evolution of a genome is a random process driven by
natural selection. Chapter 17 describes the many features
of microbial evolution, but here in Chapter 9 we discuss the
molecular mechanisms that drive that evolution.

GENES AND GENOMES

The result of evolution can be seen in the genomes of
various strains of the gut microbe Escherichia coli. Much
of this evolution presumably took place in the intestines of
human and other animal hosts, the normal habitat of this
organism. The K-12 strain (MG1655), for example, contains
4,641,652 base pairs (compared with the 3 billion base pairs
of the human genome). Of this genome, 87.8% encodes proteins, 0.8% encodes tRNA and rRNA, and another 0.7% is
DNA with no known function. Approximately 11% of the
chromosome is involved with various forms of regulation.
Even though E. coli is the best-studied organism on the
planet, about 20% of the 4,489 genes still remain a mystery
to us, having no known function other than vague annotations such as “oxidoreductase.” Close examination of the
sequences reveals how the current organism we call E. coli
came about through the evolution of an ancestral genome.
Two basic processes are thought to contribute to genome
restructuring: horizontal gene transfers and duplications followed by functional divergence through mutation.

fl ing comes from comparing the proportion of GC base pairs
along the chromosome (also known as GC content). On
average, the E. coli genome consists of 50.8% GC pairs. But
15% of the K-12 genome and 26% of the O157:H7 genome
show GC proportions that differ significantly from the rest
of the genome and show a different codon usage, suggesting that these genes came from other bacterial species and
were acquired by E. coli more recently. These horizontal
gene transfers, occurring via conjugation, transduction, or
transformation, are estimated to happen at the rate of about
16 kb, or 0.4% of the E. coli genome, every million years.
Noticing a sudden change in the GC content in a chromosome DNA sequence is the equivalent of an evolutionary
“footprint” marking a horizontal gene transfer. The region
where such a change is observed is called a genomic island.

Microbial genomes evolve by randomly assembling an eclectic array of genes from many sources. For example, it has been
estimated that nearly 20% of the E. coli genome may have originated in other microbes. E. coli strain O157:H7, the culprit in
several fatal outbreaks of food-borne disease throughout the
world, contains 1,387 genes that are not in strain K-12. These
additional genes represent about 25% of the O157:H7 genome
and encode virulence factors, metabolic pathways, and prophages (phage genes integrated into host chromosomes), all of
which were acquired from other species. The impact of horizontal gene transfer on genome evolution is estimated to be
100 times greater than the impact of mutations.

containing numerous genes that serve a common function,
such as virulence (pathogenicity islands), symbiosis (symbiosis islands), or survival (fitness islands).
Genomic islands are often flanked by boundary regions
such as direct repeats or insertion elements, usually found
near tRNA genes (Fig. 9.37). The association of genomic
islands with tRNA genes may reflect the fact that some
tRNA genes are dispensable because often multiple copies of
a given tRNA gene are present within a genome. Genomic
islands as a whole are often genetically unstable, subject to
further rearrangements or deletions, and very often contain
functional or remnant mobility genes encoding transposases,
integrases, or other enzymes associated with recombination.
Pathogenicity and symbiosis islands can encode remarkable protein secretion systems (called type III and type
IV secretion systems) capable of injecting effector proteins directly from the bacterium straight into a eukaryotic

appear to include a variety of genes horizontally transferred
from bacteria (Fig. 9.39). How the genes jumped domains

transferred from Bacteria to eukaryotic ticks and mites several times over millions of years. The bacterial version of
the protein, called Tae, degrades peptidoglycan and is delivered as the tip of a spear from one bacterium to another via
type VI secretion (discussed in Special Topic 25.1). Once
injected into the “enemy” bacterium, Tae kills the victim
by disassembling the bacterial cell wall. Among the eukaryotic recipients of the dae gene is the deer tick Ixodes scapularis, which serves as the reservoir for the Lyme disease
spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease is described
in Chapter 26). After their horizontal transfer, the dae
genes became expressed and eventually acquired eukaryotic
protein secretion signals. Figure 9.40 illustrates that the
I. scapularis dae gene helps the insect control the levels of
B. burgdorferi colonizing the tick’s midgut. The bacterial
gene, therefore, became part of the Ixodes innate immune
system against B. burgdorferi and probably other bacteria.
Innate immunity is described in Chapter 23. Evidence of
more massive DNA transfers from some endosymbiotic
bacteria to their eukaryotic hosts is discussed in eTopic 9.6.
Can interdomain DNA transfers take place in the opposite direction—from humans to bacteria, for instance?
Mark Anderson and Han Seifert from Northwestern University found that up to 11% of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates (the cause of gonorrhea) contain human-derived DNA
sequences known as L1, or long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). LINEs are human DNA sequences that
copy and insert themselves from one gene into another.
Since the L1 sequence in N. gonorrhoeae was not found in
the closely related species N. meningitidis, the transfer from
L1 to N. gonorrhoeae probably occurred relatively recently
in evolutionary history (after N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis split from their common ancestor). The function of
Neisseria L1 is currently unknown.

The Intestine: Cauldron of HGT

The human gastrointestinal tract is ideal for exchanging genetic information between widely diverse species

(Section 23.1). The gut contains a high bacterial cell density and mixed-species biofilms that enable close and frequent contact between organisms, both living (a requisite
for conjugation) and dead (a source of transforming DNA).
The intestine is also rife with phages that can mediate transduction. Section 8.6 described a spectacular example of
horizontal transfer that likely took place within the human
gut. A gene enabling digestion of a complex carbohydrate
found only in red seaweed was transferred from a marine
bacterium to an ancestor of the human intestinal bacterium
Bacteroides plebeius. Human digestion, helped by this new
bacterium, could now harvest carbon and energy from this
unique carbohydrate.
Perhaps the most intriguing and worrisome evidence of
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the gut involves antibiotic resistance. The gut microbiome can be considered
a repository of many antibiotic resistance genes, usually
within anaerobic members of the microbiome. Studies that
examined the gut metagenomes of hundreds of individuals have identified upwards of 1,000 antibiotic resistance
genes “lurking” among the microbial population. Their
presence is not always evident until someone is treated with
an antibiotic. For example, a plasmid encoding high-level
resistance to carbapenem antibiotics was horizontally transferred from Klebsiella pneumoniae to Escherichia coli in the
intestine of a 91-year-old patient. The resistance enzyme,
carbapenemase, confers resistance to all cephalosporins,
monobactams, and carbapenems used as first-line drugs
for hospitalized patients (Chapter 27). The man was being
treated for sepsis (a severe blood infection) with ertapenem. When the man’s stool was tested after treatment, it
contained carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, but not
E. coli. One month later, carbapenem-resistant E. coli containing the same plasmid was recovered from his stool.
Antibiotic exposure may even induce HGT among
microbiome members. Human volunteers whose stools
contained erythromycin-susceptible Bacteroides strains were
given erythromycin. Within 7 days, erythromycin-resistant
Bacteroides strains were found. Conjugation of erythromycin resistance plasmids from unknown members of the gut

FIGURE 9.41 ■ Model for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between gut microbiota. High cell density and biofilm formation in the
intestine makes the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance (or other genes) easier. Many anaerobic members of the human microbiome
(such as Bacteroides) serve as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes. Various gene transfer mechanisms will randomly transfer the genes,
often on plasmids, to other members of the microbiota, some of which are opportunistic pathogens (E. coli, for instance). Opportunistic
pathogens can escape the gut to cause disease in other body locations. Source: Derived from Shaick, 2015. The gut resistome. Philosophical Transactions of

microbiome were implicated. Antibiotics can also induce
the SOS response in bacteria. The SOS response will activate prophage replication (Section 9.4), and the resulting
phage can mediate transduction of genes encoding antibiotic resistance, or other functions, to gut coinhabitants.
Figure 9.41 illustrates the mechanisms by which antibiotic
resistance genes can be transferred between reservoir gut
microbes to opportunistic pathogens that can escape the
intestine, either by defecation or intestinal lesion, to infect
elsewhere.

Genome Reduction

It is important to note that evolution involves gene loss
as well as gene acquisition. The large-scale loss of genes
through evolution is known as genome reduction. For
example, pathogenic shigellae (the cause of bacillary dysentery) exhibit chromosomal “black holes,” regions lacking
genes that occur in the closely related E. coli. Absence of
these genes is required for a fully virulent phenotype (why
is not clear). Genome reduction is discussed in Chapter 17.

Sometimes evidence of genome reduction in the making can be observed. Many genomes contain pseudogenes,
genes that by homology appear to encode an enzyme but
are nonfunctional because a portion is missing through
deletion. These appear to be the remnants of genes that
were useful to an ancestral species but were made superfluous when one of its descendants adapted to a new environmental niche. When evolutionary pressure to retain a
functional form of the gene no longer exists, the imperative
to repair mutations within that gene also evaporates. The
pseudogene, therefore, is in the process of being eliminated.
One pathogen caught in the act of losing its genes because
of its lifestyle is Mycobacterium leprae, the cause of Hansen’s
disease (leprosy). Over half of the M. leprae genome is made
of pseudogenes, presumably formed from genes it no longer
needs after becoming an obligate intracellular pathogen.

Controlling uninvited genes. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli
(EHEC) expresses many virulence genes from horizontally
transferred pathogenicity islands (PAIs). Certain PAI proteins
injected into intestinal cells compel pedestals to form that
cup the bacteria (panel A). Vanessa Sperandio and Charley
Gruber discovered that this PAI process is controlled by a
non-PAI regulatory system (GlmZ) that normally controls cell
wall synthesis. Low GlmZ levels (panel B) increase pedestal
formation compared to wild type (panel A), whereas high
levels of GlmZ (panel C) decrease pedestal formation. Thus,
the core chromosome-encoded Glm system was co-opted to

when it needs to alter its physiology and explains the
regulatory mechanisms used to effect that change.

10.1 Gene Expression: Levels of Control

Why do PAI genes co-opt nonPAI regulators to control their
expression?

The most likely reason horizontally acquired islands appropriate
recipient regulatory systems is
that those systems already sense
the cell’s environment. The Glm system, for example, controls synthesis of amino sugars used for cell wall biosynthesis. It was “smart” for EHEC PAI genes involved in type III
secretion (T3SS) to co-opt Glm control because assembly
of this secretion system requires cell wall rearrangement.

Yes. QseEF is a two-component signal transduction system
that binds epinephrine to sense entry into a host. QseEF initiates pedestal formation by activating several PAI genes.
Boris Gorke’s group found that QseF also regulates synthesis
of the sRNA glmY that stabilizes GlmZ. So, during infection,
QseE senses epinephrine and phosphorylates QseF. QseF-P
activates the transcription of glmY, which then stabilizes
GlmZ. Finally, elevated GlmZ limits pedestal formation.

GENES AND GENOMES

The Current Research Highlight illustrates how a horizontally acquired gene becomes integrated into the regulatory network of a bacterial cell. Integration ensures that the
new gene is expressed only when it is beneficial to the cell.
But what constitutes a regulatory network? Microbes use
numerous mechanisms to sense their internal and external
environments. The information collected directs synthesis of waves of proteins whose concentrations change with
changing environments. The cell’s surface, for example,
contains an array of sensing proteins that monitor osmolarity, pH, temperature, and the chemical content of the
surroundings. Quorum sensing, in which bacteria secrete
and sense chemical signaling molecules, allows members
of microbial communities to communicate, cooperate, and
even promote symbiotic relationships.
Take the Hawaiian bobtailed squid, Euprymna scolopes.
During the day, this tiny squid remains buried in the sand
of shallow reef flats around Hawaii. After sunset, the animal emerges from its hiding place and begins its search
for food. As it swims in the moonlit night, its light organ
projects light downward in an apparent attempt to camouflage the squid from predatory fish swimming below.
Looking up, the fish see only light (called counterillumination), not a squid’s shadow moving against the surfacefiltered light of the moon. The light, however, is not made
by the squid. Inside the squid’s light organ are luminescent bacteria called Aliivibrio fischeri (formerly Vibrio
fischeri). Bacteria, not the squid, produce the light. However, these microbes do not constantly glow. They light
up only when their cell number and the concentration of
a secreted signaling molecule rise above a threshold level.
The critical density of bacteria is attained by nightfall, and
the genes needed to make light are “turned on.” Symbiosis is achieved because the bacteria obtain nutrients growing in the light organ, and the squid, for its part, survives
another night.
Chapter 10 explores the fundamental principles of gene
regulation in microbes and discusses how these individual
systems are woven into global regulatory networks that
interconnect many processes throughout the cell.

In general, DNA sequence–level control is the most drastic and the least reversible, whereas control at the protein
(translational/posttranslational) level is the most rapid and
most reversible. We summarize these control levels here
and then discuss examples.

10.1

Gene Expression:
Levels of Control

How many ways can a gene’s expression be controlled? The
expression of genes and their products (mRNA and protein) can be controlled at various levels, with each level of
control offering different advantages to the cell. The major
levels of control can be categorized as DNA sequence controls, mRNA stability controls, transcriptional controls,
translational controls, and posttranslational modifications.

■

Alteration of DNA sequence. Some microbes use random or programmed changes of DNA sequence to activate or disable a particular gene. One example is phase
variation, in which reversible fl ipping of a DNA segment
enables a pathogen to turn on or turn off expression of
cell-surface proteins. The switch in protein structure
helps the microbe evade a host’s immune system.

■

Control of transcription. Many types of gene regulation occur at the level of transcription. The most
common mechanisms of transcriptional control in prokaryotes involve operons. Recall that an operon is a
string of two or more genes in a chromosome that are
expressed from a common promoter located in front of
the first gene in the operon. Genes in an operon are
coordinately regulated by protein repressors, activators,
and sigma factors, as well as by small RNAs (sRNAs).
Coordinate regulation means that the expression levels of all genes in the operon increase or decrease
simultaneously.

■

Control of mRNA stability. Levels of specific mRNA
molecules are regulated by RNase activity, which
degrades some mRNA molecules as fast as they are
transcribed. In some cases, sRNA molecules bind RNA
transcripts and help or hinder degradation.

■

Translational control. Translation by ribosomes can
be regulated by sequestering mRNA ribosome-binding
sites or by concealing mRNA sequences that recognize
specific translational repressor proteins. Translational
control mechanisms are often coupled to transcriptional
mechanisms, offering “fine-tuning” of operon control.
Attenuation, for instance, is a mechanism that uses
translation to sense the level of an amino acid in the cell
and then increase or decrease transcription of the genes
encoding the enzymes that synthesize the amino acid.

■

Posttranslational control. Once proteins are made,
their activity can be controlled by modifying protein
structure—for example, by protein cleavage, phosphorylation, methylation, or acetylation. These modifications
can activate, deactivate, or even lead to the destruction
of the protein.

All of these control measures can be used in various
combinations by the cell to build integrated control circuits
that coordinately regulate multiple systems throughout the
cell—a key to homeostasis and balanced growth (see nitrogen regulation, discussed in Section 15.5).

CHAPTER 10

We begin our discussion of gene expression by describing how DNA rearrangements can flip genes on and off.
Next we discuss how bacterial cells monitor conditions
inside and outside of the cell to make “informed” decisions
about altering gene expression. In Section 10.2 we will
then explore several paradigms of operon control.

DNA Rearrangements That
Alter Gene Expression

Most regulatory mechanisms that alter gene expression
use interactions between proteins and DNA, proteins and
RNA, or RNA and RNA. These control mechanisms are
easily reversible. A more drastic means of control, however, involves altering the DNA sequence itself. A classic
example of this strategy is phase variation. Phase variation
helps microbial pathogens avoid the immune system.
Any infection will trigger the production of antibodies specific to the invading microbe’s component parts,
such as pili, flagella, and lipopolysaccharides (discussed in
Chapter 24). Antibodies that bind to these microbial surface structures are useful for clearing an infection. However, some microbes use gene regulation to periodically
change their immunological appearance, like a chameleon
changing its color, by changing the amino acid composition of a particular surface protein. This “shape-shifting”
by the microbe, called phase variation, renders useless
those antibodies specific for the old structure. The embattled immune system must start all over again making new
antibodies, thus prolonging the course of infection. Two
types of DNA rearrangement can be used to generate phase
variations: gene inversions and slipped-strand mispairing.
Gene inversion: an on/off switch. Flagellar phase varia-

tion in the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella enterica
involves a DNA recombination event known as gene inversion that fl ips the orientation of a gene or DNA segment
in the chromosome. S. enterica has two genes, widely separated on the chromosome, that encode different forms
of flagellin, the protein from which flagella are made. A
reversible DNA inversion turns off one gene while turning
on the other. The invertible switch is a 993-bp DNA fragment (or cassette), called the H region, that contains an
outwardly directed promoter and a gene called hin, whose
product, Hin recombinase (also called Hin invertase),
mediates the recombination (Fig. 10.1). In antigenic parlance, the term “H antigen” refers to flagella, so the acronym “Hin” stands for H inversion. The hin DNA cassette
is flanked by short (26-bp) inverted repeats called hixL
(left) and hixR (right).

■

MOLECULAR REGULATION

Note:

An inverted repeat is a sequence found in identical (but
inverted) forms at two sites on the same double helix (for example,
5′-ATCGATCGnnnnnnCGATCGAT-3′). A direct repeat is a sequence
found in identical form at two sites on the same double helix (for
example, 5′-ATCGATCGnnnnnnATCGATCG-3′). A tandem repeat is
a direct repeat without any intervening DNA sequence (for example, ATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCG).

Hin recombinase collaborates with other less specific
DNA remodeling proteins, such as Fis, to link the 26-bp
left (hixL) and right (hixR) ends of the invertible DNA element. The two ends, each bound to a Hin monomer, are
brought together by Hin-Hin protein interactions. DNA
within the cassette then forms a loop. Hin cuts within
the center of each hix site, producing staggered ends. An
exchange of Hin subunits leads to strand inversion, so that
the orientation of the DNA cassette is reversed relative to
the flanking DNA on either side.
In one orientation, the outwardly directed promoter of
the H region directs expression of H2 flagellin (encoded by
fljB) and a repressor (FljA) that prevents transcription of the
other flagellin gene, fliC (see Fig. 10.1A). After the inversion, however, the promoter points in the wrong direction,
so there is no production of H2 flagellin or FljA, the repressor of fliC (see Fig. 10.1D). Lacking this repressor, the fliC
flagellin gene is expressed. Thus, H1 flagellin (present in
phase 1 cells) is synthesized instead of H2 flagellin (present in phase 2 cells). The amino acid sequences, and thus
the antigenicity, of the two flagellar proteins are different.
Inversion of the H region allows Salmonella to change how
it appears to a host immune system. In each generation, the
rate of the reversible switch varies from about one cell in
103 to one in 105. Note, however, that this switch would
not accomplish much if the infecting population of bacteria
started out mixed—that is, producing both types of flagella.
The initial infection must be of one phenotype.
Slipped-strand mispairing. A different type of phase varia-

tion relies on multiple, short sequence repeats within a gene.
The repeats “confuse” DNA polymerase as it replicates, causing it to slip occasionally during replication. Slippage either
adds a repeat to, or deletes a repeat from, the gene and alters
its translational reading frame. If the mRNA produced during transcription is out of frame, the protein is not made.
This random process can alternately turn a gene off and then
back on again in subsequent generations. A detailed example
is discussed in eTopic 10.1 using the opa genes of Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea. Eukaryotic
microbes, especially pathogenic sporozoa, possess elaborate mechanisms of phase variation. The trypanosome that
causes “sleeping sickness” undergoes extensive genetic shuffl ing and mutation of its coat proteins over successive generations, essentially overwhelming the host immune system by
presenting every possible form of antigen.

Because the repressor FljA is not formed, the gene for H1 can be expressed (D).

Thought Question

10.1 While viewing Figure 10.1, imagine the phenotype of a

cell in which fljB has been deleted but fljA is still expressed.
Would cells be motile? What type of flagella would be produced? Would the cells undergo phase variation? What would
happen if fliC alone was deleted?

General Concepts of
Transcriptional Control

DNA rearrangements that alter gene expression are random,
controlled only by the efficiency of the recombinase catalyzing an inversion or the fidelity by which a DNA polymerase

replicates sequence repeats. However, transcriptional and
translational controls are not random. For those mechanisms, a cell must monitor two compartments—the cytoplasm within the cell and the environment outside—to know
when to alter gene expression and adjust its physiology.
Intracellularly, the concentrations of vitamins, amino
acids, and nucleotides must be sufficient and balanced to
supply the biosynthetic and energetic needs of the cell. To
achieve balance, the cell must control de novo (new) synthesis of these compounds and sense the carbon and energy
sources that are present in order to assemble the proper catabolic pathway.
The microbe also needs to detect hazardous conditions
outside the cell and to distinguish whether it is floating

in a pond of water, a gastrointestinal tract, or a mammalian host cell. Once the environment is sensed, the cell can
change the repertoire of genes it expresses to meet its needs
or to protect itself.
Cells use different mechanisms to sense and respond to
conditions within the cell and outside the cell membrane.
Sensing conditions within the cell is relatively straightforward. Regulatory proteins bind specific low-molecularw
weight compounds called ligands (Fig. 10.2A). Different
w

e
proteins bind different ligands. For example,
one
o
n regulator binds a carbohydrate ligand and alerts the
cell that a new carbon source is available, while a different regulator senses whether enough of the amino acid
tryptophan is present in the cytoplasm to carry out protein synthesis. The ligand, once bound, then alters the
ability of the regulatory protein to latch onto specific
DNA regulatory sequences located near the promoters of target genes. The regulatory gene may be located
near to or quite far away from the target gene on the
chromosome.
Genes encoding regulatory proteins are usually, but
not always, transcribed separately from the target gene
(Fig. 10.2A). Regulatory proteins come in two forms:
repressors and activators (note that activator proteins differ from activator sequences of DNA). Repressor proteins
bind to regulator sequences and prevent the transcription
of target genes—an event known as repression. Repression happens in one of two ways (scenarios 1 and 2 in
Fig. 10.2B), depending on the repressor. In scenario 1, the
repressor binds a specific DNA sequence and prevents transcription of a target gene. Relief from repression requires
that a specific ligand, called an inducer, bind to the repressor protein, causing it to release from the DNA sequence.
Because a small inducer molecule is required, the increased
expression of the target gene is called induction. The lactose operon, discussed in Section 10.2, is one example of
an inducible system.

Note:

DNA regulatory sequences are sometimes called “operator sequences” if binding decreases expression of the target genes,
or “activator sequences” if binding increases expression.

362

PART 2

GENES AND GENOMES

Other repressor proteins (scenario 2) bind poorly to
DNA regulatory sequences unless they first bind a small
ligand called a corepressor. As the ligand disappears from
the cell, it is no longer available to bind to the repressor
protein. When this happens, the repressor releases from
the DNA and the target gene is expressed. This process is
called derepression rather than induction. The tryptophan
operon, also discussed later, is an example of a repression/
derepression system.
Activator proteins also bind DNA, but they stimulate
transcription by touching an RNA polymerase stuck
at a nearby promoter, spurring it to initiate transcription (Fig. 10.2C). Most activator proteins bind poorly
to DNA sequences, unless an inducer is present. When
the intracellular concentration of inducer falls, the activator protein (without inducer) either leaves the DNA or
moves to a nearby site from which it can no longer contact
RNA polymerase. As a result, transcription of that target
gene stops.

CI from lambda phage, binds to DNA. The protein

forms a dimer, and one part of each molecule, called the
DNA-binding domain, interacts with DNA in the major
groove. DNA sites that bind regulatory proteins typically
exhibit a sequence symmetry that involves an inverted
repeat (Fig. 10.4). Dimers of a regulatory protein bind
to the DNA, with each member of the duo binding half
of the symmetrical DNA sequence. Protein-DNA binding can be demonstrated in several ways, as described in
Section 12.3.
It is important to realize that all DNA-binding proteins can actually bind at a low level to any DNA sequence.
However, each individual binding protein will bind more
tightly to a specific sequence near a particular promoter.
Thus, DNA-binding proteins exhibit a relative specificity
for DNA target sequences, not absolute specificity. These
proteins essentially “scan” DNA for high-affinity binding sites. Relative specificity helps explain how a promoter,
through evolution, “recruits” the service of a regulatory

Operon Control

In 1961, French scientists Jacques Monod (1910–1976)
and François Jacob (1920–2013) (Fig. 10.6A) proposed
the revolutionary idea that the expression of genes could
be regulated. They, among others, noticed that the enzyme
used by Escherichia coli to consume the carbohydrate lactose was produced only when lactose was added to growth
media. The term “induction” was coined to describe this
phenomenon. The enzymes required to metabolize glucose, however, behaved differently. They were always

present (that is, constitutive) in the cell. The groundbreaking work of Jacob and Monod, and of André Lwoff (1902–
1994) (Fig. 10.6B) for his study of phage lysogeny, won
them a Nobel Prize and launched the field of gene regulation, a scientific realm where discoveries continue to
surprise us.

Lactose catabolism. Lactose is a disaccharide sugar made
of glucose and galactose that can be used as a carbon and
energy source (Fig. 10.7). The E. coli integral membrane
protein that imports (transports) lactose from the extracellular environment is called LacY. The enzyme that subsequently cleaves lactose into its component parts is called

beta-galactosidase (LacZ). The products, glucose and
galactose, are subsequently degraded by the enzymes of
glycolysis to harness energy and capture carbon (see Section 13.5). Without LacY and LacZ, the catabolic energy of
lactose is unavailable to the cell.
Lactose induces the lac operon. Figure 10.8A

the genes in E. coli that encode the simple regulatory circuit for lactose catabolism. The genes lacZ, lacY, and
lacA form an operon, which is a group of genes cotranscribed from a common promoter. The role of lacA, which

In the absence of lactose, the lac operon is transcribed
at extremely low levels (fewer than ten molecules of LacZ
per cell). The reason for low expression is that transcription of lacZYA is repressed by the protein product of the
regulator gene lacI (Fig. 10.8B). The lacI gene is situated
immediately upstream of lacZYA and is transcribed from
a different promoter. A tetramer of LacI repressor protein
forms in the cell and binds to two operator regions

simultaneously binds the lacO and lacOI operators (a
dimer at each site). As a result, the intervening DNA loops
out (Figs. 10.8B and 10.9A) and prevents RNA polymerase from continuing transcription into the structural
lacZYA genes. (A third binding site for LacI exists but is
not important to our discussion here.)
Once lactose is added to the medium, the lac operon is
expressed at 100-fold higher levels. How does lactose get
into the cell to induce the operon if the operon encoding its transport protein is repressed? As noted already,
even when repressed, the lacZYA operon is transcribed
at a low level. (Most genes are expressed at low constitutive levels even when uninduced.) This means that a
small amount of lactose can be transported into the cell
because a few molecules of the lactose transporter LacY
are made. The tiny amount of beta-galactosidase (LacZ)
expressed in uninduced cells is also important. At this low
level, the enzyme does not completely cleave the glycosidic bond of lactose, but rearranges it to form allolactose, the form of lactose that activates the operon (whose
structure is shown in Fig. 10.7). Allolactose binds the

repressor and “unlocks” the protein (by altering the conformation of LacI) so that it is released from the operator (Fig. 10.8C). Once this happens, RNA polymerase
guided by sigma factor (not shown in Fig. 10.8C) can
find the lac promoter sequences and initiate transcription
of the lacZYA structural genes.
cAMP and cAMP receptor protein stimulate transcription. Another important mechanism that governs the level

of lacZYA transcription in E. coli involves a small molecule
called cyclic AMP (cAMP), which accumulates when a cell
is starved for carbon. Cyclic AMP is a derivative of AMP
(adenosine monophosphate) in which the 5′ phosphate is
linked to the 3′ OH group of the ribose, making a cyclic
structure. How cellular levels of cAMP change in response
to carbon starvation has been extensively studied, but questions still remain. What is clear is that intracellular cAMP
levels fluctuate with the activities of enzymes that can make
(adenylyl cyclase), degrade (phosphodiesterases), or export
cAMP. Various internal and external signals alter the balance of these processes (see eTopic 10.2).

Polycistronic message

Activation of the lacZYA operon by cAMP

and CRP. Although the inducer allolactose removes the repres-

sor LacI and allows expression of lacZYA, maximum expression
requires the presence of cAMP and cAMP receptor protein (CRP),
which bind to a separate site at the lacZYA promoter. Bound CRP
can interact with RNA polymerase and increase the rate of transcription initiation.

As it accumulates, cyclic AMP controls the expression
of many genes by combining with a dimeric regulatory
protein called cAMP receptor protein (CRP). The cAMPCRP complex binds to specific DNA sequences located
near many bacterial genes and modifies their transcription, usually acting as an activator. This is the case for the
lacZYA operon (Figs. 10.10 and 10.8D).

Note:

The original name for CRP was “catabolite activator protein” (CAP), given to reflect its role in catabolite repression. Though
some investigators still use the “CAP” designation, the term “CRP”
is generally preferred today. Thus, the gene encoding the protein
is called crp.

How does the cAMP-CRP complex ultimately activate
the expression of lacZYA? RNA polymerase cannot easily
form an open complex (see Section 8.2) and is essentially
stuck at lacP, even in the absence of a LacI repressor. This
problem is overcome when the cAMP-CRP complex binds
to a 22-bp DNA sequence located –60 bp from the start
of transcription (just upstream of the lacZYA operator),
causing the DNA to bend (see Figs. 10.8D and 10.9C).
CRP can then directly interact with the alpha subunit of
RNA polymerase bound at the lac promoter and activate
transcription (Fig. 10.11 and eTopic 10.3). Notice in Figure 10.9B that when neither glucose nor lactose is present,
cAMP-CRP cannot by itself activate lacZYA transcription,
because it binds within the DNA loop formed by the LacI
(repressor) tetramer, leaving no room for RNA polymerase
to bind to DNA.

Note:

Recall that a gene name written in roman (not italic) type
and with a capital first letter is really the name of the protein product of that gene. Thus, lacZ is the gene, but LacZ is the protein.
In presenting a genotype, gene names written with a superscript
+ are considered wild-type genes. Gene names written without a
superscript + are considered mutant genes.

Thought Questions

10.3 Predict the effects of the following null mutations on

the induction of beta-galactosidase by lactose, and predict
whether the lacZ gene is expressed at high or low levels in
each case: The inactivated, mutant genes to consider are lacI,
lacO, lacP, crp, and cya (the gene encoding adenylyl cyclase).
What effects will those mutations have on catabolite repression?

10.4 Predict what will happen to the expression of lacZ
when a second copy of the lac operon region containing
various mutations is present on a plasmid. The genotypes of
these partial diploid strains are presented as chromosomal
genes/plasmid gene. (a) lacI– lacO+P+Z!+Y!+A+/plasmid lacI+;
(b) lacO– lacI+P+Z!+Y!+A+/plasmid lacO+; (c) crp– lacI+O+P+Z!+
Y!+A+/plasmid crp+.

Glucose represses the lac operon. What happens if, in

addition to lactose, the medium contains an alternative carbon source, such as glucose? Enzymes for glucose catabolism (glycolysis) are always produced at high levels because
glucose is the favored catabolite (carbon source), providing the quickest source of energy. Many carbohydrates,
including lactose, must fi rst be converted to glucose to be
catabolized. So, in the interest of greater efficiency, E. coli
forestalls inducing the lac operon while glucose is present.

the experiment to parallel cultures, and beta-galactosidase activity
was measured. At the point indicated, glucose was added to one
culture. From that point on, synthesis of beta-galactosidase continued to increase in the culture that lacked glucose but stopped in the
culture that had glucose.

The PTS transfers a phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) along a series of proteins to glucose during transport. When
glucose is present, the glucose transport proteins continually transfer phosphate to glucose
and, so, are usually left without phosphate
(Fig. 10.13A). Unphosphorylated enzyme
IIA interacts with LacY in the membrane
and inhibits LacY activity. So, lactose cannot enter the cell, and the lac operon remains
uninduced. When glucose is not present, the
PTS proteins remain phosphorylated; enzyme
IIA-P does not interact with LacY, so LacY
transports lactose into the cell; and the lac
operon is induced (Fig. 10.13B).

A. Glucose present
Glucose moves from protein IIC
to IIB, which transfers a
phosphate from IIA to glucose.
Glucose 6- P

The phenomenon is known as catabolite repression, in
which the presence of a more favorable catabolite (commonly glucose) prevents expression of operons enabling
catabolism of a second carbohydrate.
When glucose and lactose are both present in the
medium, cells initially grow by breaking down glucose
until the glucose is depleted. Growth temporarily stops
while lactose present in the medium induces the lacZYA
operon. Once induced, cells can consume lactose and
resume growth. The resultant biphasic growth curve is
often called diauxic growth (Fig. 10.12A). But if lactose
was present from the start, why was lacZYA turned off?
It was turned off because glucose indirectly prevents the
induction of lacZYA. Figure 10.12B illustrates that even
when lacZYA is already induced, adding glucose stops (or
represses) induction.
Catabolite repression via inducer exclusion. Failure
of lactose to induce lacZYA during growth on glucose
(Fig. 10.12B, red horizontal line) is due mainly to the fact
that growth on glucose keeps lactose out of the cell. This
phenomenon is known as inducer exclusion. If lactose cannot enter the cell, the lacZYA operon cannot be induced.
The key to inducer exclusion is that a component of the
glucose transport system (phosphotransferase system, or
PTS; see eTopic 4.1), while transporting glucose, will bind
to and inhibit LacY permease (Fig. 10.13).

10.5 Researchers often use isopropyl-β-D-

thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) rather than lactose to induce
the lacZYA operon. IPTG resembles lactose, which is why it
can interact with the LacI repressor, but it is not degraded
by beta- galactosidase. Why do you think the use of IPTG is
preferred in these studies?

Other Systems of Operon Control

Besides the lac operon model, bacteria have a surprising number of different ways to regulate operons. In
this section we discuss proteins that have dual regulatory
functions—performing as both activators (positive control) and repressors (negative control)—and we’ll see how
an idling ribosome sends a chemical signal that affects the
expression of many genes and operons.

The AraC/XylS Family of
Transcriptional Regulators

What could be better than having a regulatory protein that
either represses (like LacI) or activates (like CRP) expression of an operon? How about a regulator that can repress
and activate gene expression, depending on whether a
carbohydrate substrate is available? A regulator this versatile will provide very tight control over operon expression. One such regulator, called AraC, regulates the genes
encoding arabinose catabolism. When arabinose is absent,
AraC represses expression of the genes that break down
arabinose; but when arabinose is present, AraC activates
these same genes. The products of these genes ultimately
convert the five-carbon sugar L-arabinose to D-xylulose
5-phosphate, an intermediate in the pentose phosphate

shunt, a pathway that provides reducing energy for biosynthesis (see Section 13.5).
Bioinformatic computer analysis of microbial genomes
reveals a family of over 10,000 regulators with homology to AraC and the closely related XylS activator (xylose
catabolism). For instance, YbtA is an AraC-type regulator of the Yersinia pestis pesticin/yersiniabactin receptor
for iron uptake. The signature sequence of these proteins
is found at the C-terminal end and contains DNA-binding
motifs. The AraC/XylS family members are a diverse group
of intracellular sensors that collectively regulate a variety of
different cell functions, including carbon metabolism and
virulence, as well as many responses to environmental conditions (Table 10.1).
The AraC/XylS advantage. One advantage of AraC/XylS

family regulators, based on the AraC prototype, is that
they remain affi xed to their target genes. A drawback of the
LacI repressor strategy is that the repressors in this family
must fully dissociate from operator DNA during induction
and disperse throughout the cell. Reestablishing repression requires slow, random diffusion of bulky LacI proteins
back to the lacO DNA sequence. This takes some time. The
AraC/XylS family strategy keeps the regulatory protein
bound near target operons. The regulators simply shuttle back and forth between repressor and activator DNAbinding sites, shortening the delay between induction and
repression. The known small chemical inducer molecules
for these regulators quickly diffuse through the cytoplasm
to fi nd their cognate regulatory proteins already camped at
target promoters.
The AraC strategy. The model for regulation by AraC/

XylS regulators is based primarily on AraC itself, the most
intensely studied family member. AraC is a 33-kDa protein
with a DNA-binding C-terminal domain attached by a flexible linker peptide to the N-terminal dimerization domain
(Fig. 10.14A). AraC forms a dimer in vivo that can assume
one of two conformations, depending on whether arabinose is available. When arabinose is absent, the dimer exists

in a rigid, elongated form because the N-terminal arm
of each monomer binds to its own C-terminal domain.
This form represses expression of the araBAD operon for
arabinose degradation. When arabinose is present, however, the dimer assumes a more compact form because the
N-terminal arm of one monomer binds to the N-terminal
domain of the other monomer. This compact form activates expression of araBAD (Fig. 10.14B).
How does AraC act as both repressor and activator?
AraC is able to bind to three important DNA-binding sites.
Two of them, O2 and I1, are widely separated and flank
a binding site for cAMP-CRP that, as discussed in Section 10.2, is a global activator of many bacterial genes,
including araBAD. The elongated AraC dimer (no arabinose) can bind these two sites. The result is a looped
DNA structure that blocks the CRP-binding site and limits activation by cAMP-CRP. The araBAD operon is not
expressed. However, the I1 site sits next to another site,
I2 , near the promoter. The compact AraC dimer (with

arabinose) can bind only to these sites. Binding to I1I2 prevents DNA loop formation, allows cAMP-CRP access to
the CRP DNA-binding site, and brings AraC close enough
to physically contact an RNA polymerase already bound
(but stuck) at the araBAD promoter. Transcription of the
araBAD operon begins.
According to this model, the DNA region is rarely free
of AraC. Arabinose moves the dimer from one site (repression) to the other (induction). AraC-like proteins show
strong family resemblance at their DNA-binding domains,
but homology usually disappears at the other end of the
protein, the dimerization domain. The dimerization
domain is where these proteins appear to bind or respond
to a particular ligand (for example, arabinose). For most of
the AraC/XylS family members, the identity of the ligand
remains a mystery that, when solved, can yield interesting
discoveries. For example, the AraC-like regulator MarR
binds salicylate (an aspirin metabolite) to activate multiple
genes conferring antibiotic resistance.

CHAPTER 10

Thought Question

10.6 When the lacI gene of E. coli is missing because of
mutation, the lacZYA operon is highly expressed regardless of
whether lactose is present in the medium. Based on Figure 10.14
and its illustration of arabinose operon expression, what would
happen to araBAD expression if AraC was missing? Why?

Repression of Anabolic
(Biosynthetic) Pathways

Repressing biosynthetic pathways is fundamentally different
from repressing catabolic (degradative) systems. Repressor
proteins that control catabolic pathways, such as lactose degradation, typically bind the initial substrate or a closely related
product (for example, allolactose in the case of the lac operon).
Binding the substrate decreases repressor protein affinity for
operator DNA. Thus, increased concentration of the substrate
or inducer actually removes the repressor from the operator
and derepresses expression of the operon. This derepression
makes sense because the cell “wants” to make the enzymes
that use the substrate as a carbon and energy source.

In contrast, genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes are regulated by repressors (called inactive aporepressors) that must
bind the end product of the pathway (for example, tryptophan
for the trp operon) to become active repressors. The pathway product that binds the aporepressor is called a corepressor. Binding of the corepressor (end product) to the repressor
increases the repressor’s affinity for the operator sequence
upstream of the target gene or operon. As the concentration
of end product, such as an amino acid or nucleotide, increases
in the cell beyond what is needed to support growth, the cell
will shut the biosynthetic pathway down and not waste energy
making a superfluous pathway or compound.

The Tryptophan Operon:
Repression and Attenuation

As just noted, many amino acid biosynthetic pathways are
controlled by transcriptional repression, in which a repressor protein binds to a DNA operator sequence to prevent
transcription. For instance, when internal tryptophan levels exceed cellular needs, the excess tryptophan (acting as
a corepressor) will bind to an inactive repressor protein,
TrpR, converting it to an active repressor (Fig. 10.15).
Holorepressor
TrpR repressor then binds to an operator DNA sequence
positioned upstream of the tryptophan (trp) operon,

trp operator inhibits−but does not
altogether prevent−transcription.

Repression, however, is not the whole story in regulating the trp operon. Many amino acid biosynthetic operons,
including the trp operon, have adopted a second strategy
for down-regulating tryptophan synthesis, which can be
used alone or in conjunction with repression. This second
mechanism is called transcriptional attenuation. Attenuation uses the ribosome as a sensor of amino acid levels. It is a transcriptional control mechanism in which the
ability to translate part of an mRNA determines whether
the transcribing RNA polymerase can continue transcription. Because attenuation halts transcription in progress, it
affords an even quicker response to changing amino acid
levels than does simple repression.
Transcriptional attenuation was discovered by Charles
Yanofsky (Fig. 10.16A ) and his colleagues at Stanford
University. While examining the beginning of the trp operon
in E. coli, they discovered an odd DNA region, called the
leader sequence, located between the trp operator and trpE,
the first structural gene of the operon. The leader sequence
encodes a short peptide, but the peptide has no enzymatic
function. Its main, if not only, role is “to be or not to be.”
Key features of the leader sequence include a pair of tryptophan codons (UGGUGG), a translational stop codon, and

four complementary nucleotide stretches within the leader
mRNA. These regions, numbered 1–4, can base-pair to
form competing stem loop structures (Fig. 10.16B). Two of
the stem loop structures are critical to the mechanism. These
are the anti-attenuator stem loop formed by regions 2 and
3 and the attenuator stem loop (or terminator stem loop)
formed by regions 3 and 4. If the 3:4 attenuator stem loop
forms, then RNA polymerase is ejected and transcription
stops (Fig. 10.16C). Formation of the 2:3 anti-attenuator
stem loop, however, prevents formation of the 3:4 stem loop
because the 2:3 stem is longer and more thermodynamically stable than the 3:4 stem. The anti-attenuator stem, if
it forms, allows RNA polymerase to transcribe into trpE
(Fig. 10.16D). But what controls which stem loop forms?
High tryptophan levels. Because the ribosome is very large,
it can barrel through RNA stem loop structures. When the
cell is replete with charged tryptophanyl-tRNA and needs
no more (Fig. 10.16C), the ribosome quickly translates
through the key tryptophan codons in the leader sequence
but runs into a translation stop codon between regions
1 and 2. The ribosome stops in this position, enveloping
region 2 and preventing formation of the 2:3 stem. As a
result, once RNA polymerase transcribes through region 4,
the 3:4 attenuator stem snaps together. The attenuator stem
then interacts with the RNA polymerase ahead of it and
halts transcription. As you would expect, the ribosome dissociates after reaching the region 2 stop codon, but because
the 3:4 stem loop is already in place, the anti-attenuator
2:3 stem loop does not form. Subsequent ribosome release
leads to formation of a 1:2 stem structure, precluding all
possibility of regions 2 and 3 annealing.
Low tryptophan levels. However, if the level of charged
tryptophanyl-tRNA is low (Fig. 10.16D), then the ribosome following behind RNA polymerase stalls over the
tryptophan codons. Because these codons occur right at
the beginning of region 1, the ribosome does not cover
region 2. So, as soon as RNA polymerase transcribes
region 3, the 2:3 anti-attenuator stem loop forms and stops
formation of the 3:4 attenuator stem loop. The result is that
RNA polymerase can continue into the structural genes,
and ultimately more tryptophan is made. (A new ribosome
binds to a ribosome-binding site at the trpE message.)
Realize that for the trp operon, attenuation is a finetuning mechanism. The repressor provides the majority of
control. However, transcriptional attenuation is a common
regulatory strategy used to control many operons that code
for amino acid biosynthesis. Note that even though translation is part of the attenuation control mechanism, attenuation is not considered translational control. The reason is
that RNA polymerase, rather than the ribosome, is the target of the control. An example of translational control is
discussed shortly.

The Stringent Response

During transitions from nutrient-rich to nutrient-poor conditions, microbes must contend with dramatic fluctuations
in growth rate. This variation presents a problem. When a
cell is growing rapidly, its molecular machinery is geared
for peak performance. The pace of synthesizing new ribosomes is frenetic, trying to keep up with rapid cell division.
The more ribosomes a cell contains, the faster that cell can
make new proteins and the faster it can grow. But what happens when the party’s over—when poor carbon and energy
sources cannot supply enough energy to maintain rapid
cell division? Without a way of curbing ribosome construction, cells would soon fill with idle ribosomes. Under these
conditions, bacteria undergo a process called the stringent
response. The stringent response causes a decrease in the
number of rRNA transcripts made for ribosome assembly
and alters the expression of numerous other genes.
In the stringent-response strategy, idling ribosomes produce a small signaling molecule called guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), which interacts with RNA polymerase and
lowers the enzyme’s ability to transcribe genes encoding
ribosomal RNA (Fig. 10.17). How is ppGpp made? When
an uncharged tRNA binds at the ribosome A site, which can
happen during amino acid starvation, a ribosome-associated
protein called RelA transfers phosphate from ATP to GTP to
form ppGpp. This signal nucleotide interacts with the beta
subunit of RNA polymerase and diminishes its recognition
of promoters for operons producing rRNA and tRNA. The
result is the down-regulation of rRNA and tRNA synthesis.
The less rRNA there is available for building ribosomes, the
fewer ribosomes will be produced.
This raises another question. Even though the synthesis of ribosomal RNA has been curtailed, won’t the cell

continue to waste resources on the synthesis of ribosomal
proteins? It turns out that some ribosomal proteins can bind
to the mRNA that encodes them and inhibit translation. So,
when rRNA levels in the cell are low, free ribosomal proteins
accumulate in the cytoplasm, unassociated with ribosomes.
These excess ribosomal proteins begin to bind to their own
mRNA molecules and inhibit the translation of their own
coding regions, as well as the coding regions of other ribosomal proteins residing on the same polycistronic mRNA.
This process is called translational control because regulation affects the translation of an mRNA by ribosomes rather
than transcription by RNA polymerase.

DNA-binding proteins often recognize symmetrical
DNA sequences.
The lacZYA operon of E. coli is controlled by repression and activation. The tetrameric LacI repressor
binds operator DNA sequences to prevent RNA polymerase from accessing the promoter. Allolactose (rearranged lactose) binds LacI, reduces repressor affinity for
the operator, and allows induction of the operon.
The cAMP-CRP complex activates lacZYA transcription by interacting with the C-terminal domain of the
RNA polymerase alpha subunit. cAMP-CRP regulates
many types of operons.
In catabolite repression, a preferred carbon source (for example, glucose) prevents
the induction of an operon (for example,
lac) that enables catabolism of a different
carbon source (lactose). Glucose transport
through the phosphotransferase system
causes catabolite repression by inhibiting
LacY permease activity (inducer exclusion)
and lowers cAMP levels.
Many anabolic pathway genes (for
example, for tryptophan biosynthesis)
are repressed by the end product of the
pathway (for example, the amino acid),
which binds to a corepressor that inhibits transcription.
AraC-like proteins are a large family
of regulators, present in many bacterial
species, that can activate and repress a
target operon by assuming different
conformations.
Attenuation is a transcriptional regulatory mechanism in which translation of
a leader peptide affects mRNA structure
to influence transcription of a downstream structural gene.

■

The stringent response is triggered during nutrient limitation when low cellular amino acid levels cause ribosomes to
idle and synthesize the signaling molecule ppGpp. Binding of ppGpp to RNA polymerase decreases synthesis of
rRNA, which slows the rate of new ribosome synthesis. The
overall rate of translation, then, will match growth rate.

10.3

Sigma Factors and
Regulatory RNAs

We have seen how repressor and activator proteins can sense
the substrates or end products of biochemical pathways and
influence the transcription of individual genes and operons. Might the cell also control the expression of large
numbers of genes by modulating the levels or activities of
sigma factors? And might RNA molecules themselves sense
changes in cell physiology and posttranscriptionally regulate the translation or stability of other RNA molecules?
The answer to both of these questions is yes.

Sigma Factor Activity Can Be Regulated

Many bacteria employ alternative sigma factors to direct
transcription of distinct sets of genes (see Section 8.2).
For example, many Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli
or Salmonella enterica, use the sigma factor called sigma
S (also called sigma-38, RpoS, σS, or σ38) to initiate the

CHAPTER 10

■

375

Bacillus and Clostridium species such as B. anthracis
(anthrax) and C. tetani (tetanus) are soil organisms that
produce spores when nutrients become scarce. Sporulation
requires an asymmetrical cell division in which one of the
compartments, called the forespore, ultimately becomes
the spore (see Section 4.6). The regulation of this system
is quite complex, involving programs of transcription in the
mother cell that are separate from those in the forespore
compartment. How is this possible? Part of the answer is
that at the time of septum formation, when the forespore is
first produced, only 30% of the chromosome (the part near
the replication origin) is actually inside the forespore. The
remainder of the chromosome is slowly pumped in over a
15-minute period. The sporulating cell takes advantage of
this delay to selectively express different genes in different
compartments.
For example, sigma F is present in both forespore and
mother cell compartments, but it directs the transcription of select genes only in the forespore. Compartmentdependent activation starts with an intricate timing
mechanism that involves anti-sigma and anti-anti-sigma
factors (Fig. 10.18). Like all sporulation sigma factors,
sigma F is inactive when first synthesized. Sigma F is inactive because it binds to an anti-sigma F protein dubbed
SpoII AB that is cosynthesized with sigma F in the predivisional cell (Fig. 10.18A, step 1). After division, both
proteins become equally partitioned between the two
compartments. However, in addition to an anti-sigma,
there is an anti-anti-sigma F protein, called SpoIIAA

transcription of a variety of genes that promote survival in
stationary phase. In large part, Salmonella orchestrates the
stationary-phase accumulation of sigma S by modulating
proteolysis of the factor (protein degradation is discussed in
Section 8.4). ClpXP protease degrades sigma S rapidly during exponential growth. When cells enter stationary phase
or experience an environmental stress that slows growth,
degradation of sigma S stops. Sigma S levels increase in these
situations and trigger the expression of stress survival genes.
Other sigma factors are controlled by anti-sigma factor
proteins that inhibit sigma factor activity. Anti-sigma factor proteins target specific sigma factors and block access
to core RNA polymerase. The anti-sigma strategy prevents
expression of target genes until they are needed. For example, Salmonella uses an anti-sigma factor (FlgM) to time
events involved in constructing flagella. The transcription
factor sigma F is required to synthesize proteins used in the
final stages of flagellar biosynthesis. The anti-sigma factor
FlgM, however, keeps sigma F function at bay until membrane assembly of the flagellar basal bodies is complete.
Once complete, the basal body selectively secretes the antisigma factor from the cell. Secreting FlgM from the cell,
then, frees intracellular sigma F to direct transcription of
the final set of flagellar assembly genes.
Anti-sigma factors can themselves be neutralized by
anti-anti-sigma factors that bind the anti-sigma factor
more tightly than sigma factor does. The anti-anti-sigma
factor acts as a decoy to release anti-sigma factor from the
actual sigma factor. Freed sigma factor can then join core
RNA polymerase and direct transcription of target genes.
Many mechanisms can liberate sigma factors from antisigma factors. The next section describes one linked to a
cell differentiation event.

(AA for “anti-anti”), which is also equally distributed (steps
2 and 3). Anti-anti sigma factor frees sigma F from antisigma F, which is degraded by the ClpPC protease. This
is not a problem in the mother cell, because that compartment just makes more AB (anti-sigma), so sigma F is never
active.
These events occur in both compartments (forespore
and mother cell), so why is sigma F activation limited to
the forespore? Recall that at the time of septum formation,
one chromosome is slowly pumped into the forespore. The
gene encoding the AB anti-sigma factor is located far from
the origin and, as such, is not in the forespore immediately after septum formation (Fig. 10.18B, step 2). Consequently, no new AB (anti-sigma) is made in the forespore
during this time, and what was there is dislodged from σF
by anti-anti factor and degraded by ClpPC (steps 3 and 4).
Depletion of anti-sigma in the forespore frees sigma F to
act in the forespore compartment for a limited time. Liberated sigma F transcribes the genes needed for subsequent
sporulation steps. The gene targets for sigma F do reside in
the part of the genome trapped early on in the forespore.

30°C

Eventually, the spoIIAB gene enters the forespore and
replenishes anti-σF (step 5), and the next stage of sporulation begins.
Elegant proof for this model was obtained in the laboratory of Richard Losick, a leading scientist in the field of
microbial development. In Losick’s experiment, the gene
for SpoIIAB (anti-sigma) was moved from its normal location far from the origin to a position near the origin. As a
result, the anti-sigma F gene entered the forespore early,
continually replenished anti-sigma F lost by degradation,
and stopped sporulation.
The simple, unequal distribution of the chromosome
during septal formation is heavily exploited during sporulation to trigger differential gene expression in two different
cell compartments.

37°C—a set point that helps the microbe sense entry into
the mammalian host. The Gram-positive bacillus Listeria monocytogenes, for instance, causes mild gastroenteritis or serious meningitis in humans. When the organism
is ingested, it synthesizes a regulatory protein, PrfA, that
activates transcription of a number of virulence genes. The
prfA mRNA is transcribed regardless of temperature, but
its 5′ end contains a ROSE element that prevents translation until the temperature rises—after ingestion.

Regulatory RNAs

Are the regions of DNA between protein-encoding genes
merely spacers, or are they somehow important for regulating traditional genes? And what about the nontemplate
strands of genes? Do they have a function other than simply maintaining complementarity to the template strand?
A surprising fraction of a bacterial chromosome does
not encode mRNA, rRNA, or tRNA, but instead makes
untranslated RNA with regulatory functions. The laboratories of Susan Gottesman and Gisela Storz at the National
Institutes of Health (Fig. 10.20) were instrumental in

Regulation of the heat-shock sigma factor sigma H (also
called sigma-32, RpoH, σH, or σ32) in E. coli illustrates
how the synthesis of a sigma factor can be controlled at the
level of translation and degradation (Fig. 10.19). Excessive
heat, above 42°C for E. coli, causes proteins to denature
and membrane structure to deteriorate. All cells subjected
to heat above their comfort zone (optimal growth range)
will express a set of proteins called heat-shock proteins.
These proteins include chaperones that refold damaged
proteins, and a variety of other proteins that affect DNA
and membrane integrity. The transcription of many E. coli
heat-shock genes requires sigma H. So, one of the first consequences of growth at elevated temperature is an increase
in the amount of sigma H present in the cell.
The level of sigma H is regulated by two temperaturedependent mechanisms; one controls the speed (rate) of sigma
H synthesis, while the other determines its rate of degradation. The gene encoding sigma H is rpoH. At 30°C, rpoH
mRNA adopts a secondary structure at the 5′ end that buries
a ribosome-binding site, so rpoH mRNA is poorly translated.
The 5′ region of rpoH mRNA is called the ROSE element
for repression of heat shock gene expression. A sudden rise
in temperature, however, melts this secondary structure and
exposes the ribosome-binding site, allowing translation to
occur more readily. Thus, heat shock increases sigma H synthesis, which in turn increases transcription of the heat-shock
genes whose products include chaperones and proteases.
Proteolysis also controls sigma H accumulation. At 30°C,
the rpoH message is poorly translated, owing to secondary
structure, as previously described, but some sigma H protein is made. Inappropriate expression of heat-shock genes at
30°C is prevented by the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperone system, which interacts with sigma H and shuttles it to various
proteases for digestion (see Fig. 10.19). At 42°C, however,
proteolysis of sigma H decreases, and sigma H is allowed to
accumulate. Degradation decreases because at the higher
temperature, the chaperones are siphoned away from sigma
H by the many other heat-denatured proteins formed. The
new goal of the chaperones is to refold and rescue those damaged proteins. Chaperone redeployment frees sigma H to
transcribe the heat-shock genes, which include the chaperone
genes dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE. These genes also have promoters that depend on other sigma factors to drive basal expression. Thus, as the temperature rises, the amount of sigma H
is increased by two temperature-dependent mechanisms: One
increases translation by exposing the ribosome-binding site
(a so-called RNA thermometer), while the second redeploys
the chaperones that direct its proteolysis.
Many other examples of RNA thermometers exist, some
of which are involved in pathogenesis. Bacteria that infect
mammals have RNA thermometers set to body temperature,

discovering that regions between genes (intergenic regions)
can encode small RNA (sRNA) molecules (100–200 nt)
that affect the expression of many other genes.
In addition to intergenic sRNAs, there are so-called
cis-antisense RNA (asRNA) molecules. A cis-antisense
RNA is transcribed from the nontemplate DNA strand
that lay opposite an mRNA-encoding template strand
(see Fig. 8.20). Cis-antisense regulatory transcripts can
base-pair with cognate sense mRNAs and control their
expression. Regulatory RNAs help control a variety of processes, such as plasmid replication, transposition, phage
development, viral replication, bacterial virulence, environmental stress responses, and developmental control in
lower eukaryotes.
Mechanisms of sRNA function. Regulatory sRNA molecules typically affect gene expression after transcription
(posttranscriptional control) by binding to complementary
sequences located within target mRNA transcripts. These
hybridizations can either stimulate or prevent translation,
or affect degradation. Many but not all sRNAs require an
RNA chaperone protein called Hfq to stabilize the sRNA
and promote its regulatory effects on target mRNAs. Hfq is
a hexameric ring protein with sRNA- and mRNA-binding
faces. Table 10.2 groups sRNA molecules by mechanism.
Most known sRNAs inhibit translation by base-pairing
to a region of mRNA that overlaps the ribosome-binding site (RBS). Binding, therefore, prevents the ribosome
from accessing the RBS (Fig. 10.21A). Other sRNA

molecules can enhance translation by binding to part of
a long 5′ untranslated mRNA sequence located upstream
of an RBS (Fig 10.21B). Without the sRNA, the untranslated mRNA sequence folds in a way that occludes the RBS
and prevents translation. However, when sRNA binds the
target mRNA sequence, the untranslated region refolds to
expose the RBS (an example is DsrA). Ribosomes can now
bind the mRNA and translate the message.
Some sRNA molecules promote degradation of mRNA
by altering mRNA folding to expose an RNase cleavage
site (Fig. 10.21C)—for instance, RNAIII, discussed later.
The second mechanism in this group prevents degradation
of the message by binding to and occluding an RNase E–
binding site (the sRNA SgrS) (Fig. 10.21D).
Another class of sRNA affects mRNA processing.
Assisted by sRNA, a long, unstable, polycistronic transcript
can be processed to make shorter, more stable monocistronic mRNAs. For instance, an sRNA such as GadY of
E. coli, can bind between two coding regions of a polycistronic message and expose an RNase cleavage site required
for processing (Fig. 10.21E). Members of the last sRNA
regulatory group can bind to select regulator proteins and
interfere with their function (Fig. 10.21F). The sRNA—
CsrB, for example—can prevent the regulator from binding
to its DNA target sequence.
sRNA molecules expand the reach of regulatory proteins.

Large regulatory proteins (for example, LacI or TrpR)
typically control only a few genes, but their synthesis is

energetically expensive. Small RNAs can expand a protein’s
regulatory reach and, thus, maximize return on investment.
The benefits of sRNAs are that they do not require protein
synthesis to control gene expression, they diffuse rapidly,
and they typically act on preexisting messages. Small RNAs
represent one of the most economical ways to inhibit gene
expression.
One example of an sRNA molecule in E. coli is RyhB,
which regulates iron storage by expanding the reach of Fur,
the ferric uptake regulator. Iron is hugely important for
pathogens growing in the human body and for the quality
of soil, where it determines which communities of bacteria and plants can grow. However, too much iron increases
oxidative stress and damages the cell. As a result, iron content must be tightly controlled. In many bacteria, including intestinal E. coli, iron uptake is regulated by Fur, which
senses iron and regulates several genes whose products
either scavenge iron from the environment or store iron

in the cell (see Section 4.2). When intracellular iron levels
are high, Fur represses expression of scavenging genes but
induces production of iron storage proteins (Fig. 10.22A).
Fur represses gene expression by directly binding DNA
operator sequences in front of target genes. But how does
Fur activate iron storage genes? One mechanism is indirect and involves Fur repression of the sRNA RyhB (90 nt)
(Fig. 10.22B). RyhB sRNA is made when iron levels are
low (as within the human body) because the Fur repressor is not active. RyhB then helps destroy mRNAs of several iron-storing and iron-using proteins (such as succinate
dehydrogenase made from the sucCDAB operon). As a
result, dwindling iron reserves can be put to more productive use. When iron is plentiful, however, Fur will directly
repress ryhB. The lack of RyhB sRNA stabilizes the expression of the iron storage genes. Thus, succinate dehydrogenase is made, binds intracellular iron, and enables the use of
succinate as a carbon and energy source.

RNAIII forms hairpin loops that can interact with hairpin
loops at the 5′ ends of target mRNA molecules (for instance,
coagulase), one of which contains a ribosome-binding site.
Sections of the loops hybridize, block the mRNA ribosome-binding site, and inhibit translation. The RNA-RNA
hybrid is also an alluring target for a ribonuclease that will
degrade the message. RNAIII is expressed after the bacterial population reaches a certain density during infection

Cis-antisense RNA. We are increasingly fi nding that the
sense DNA strands from many protein-encoding genes
are transcribed to make so-called cis-antisense RNAs
(asRNAs) with regulatory functions. Typically, asRNAs are
700–3,000 nt long, originate within a protein-coding gene,
and affect only that gene. These features distinguish asRNA
from sRNA. Deep sequencing of the E. coli transcriptome
revealed the presence of about 1,000 different cis-antisense
RNA genes out of 4,290 protein-encoding genes. In fact,
every microbe examined produces asRNA molecules.
Different asRNAs have different effects on their target
genes. When bound to their sense mRNA counterparts,
asRNAs can engineer attenuator loops that stop transcription, prevent mRNA translation, or trigger mRNA
degradation. Even the simple act of asRNA transcription
can produce collisions between converging RNA polymerase complexes that prematurely terminate transcription. An example of the collision mechanism was found
for Clostridium acetobutylicum. The ubiG-mccBA operon
encodes proteins needed to convert methionine to cysteine (Fig. 10.24), but it is expressed only when methionine

ecules to fi ne-tune their physiology. One class of sRNA in
Archaea, called small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), is also
prominent in eukaryotes. The snoRNA designation was
retained for Archaea even though Archaea lack a nucleolus,
or nucleus, for that matter. Some archaeal snoRNAs help
guide the activity of enzymes. For example, one snoRNA
guides a methylation enzyme to methylate rRNA at specific
sites (Pyrococcus and Sulfolobus). Another snoRNA guides
the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine in rRNAs. A
second type of archaeal sRNA, called tRF, comes from
tRNA degradation. One example is a tRF produced by the
halophile Haloferax volcanii during alkaline stress. This
tRF binds to Haloferax ribosomes and inhibits translation,
thereby helping the organism survive high pH.
Archaea also produce sRNAs similar to those of bacteria, but their functions are largely unknown. One archaeal
sRNA (sRNA162) whose function is known inhibits the
translation of an mRNA that encodes methyltransferase in
Methanosarcina mazei (a methanogen). Numerous other

levels are high. When cytoplasmic methionine concentration is low, the RNA polymerase that transcribes the
antisense mccA gene will collide with, and stop, the
RNA polymerase transcribing the ubiG-mccBA operon
(Fig. 10.24B). The sense MccA transcript is not made,
and the premature transcript is degraded. However, when
methionine concentration is high, S-adenosylmethionine
(made from methionine) binds to the asRNA at the S-box
(a riboswitch, described next) and stabilizes a transcription
termination loop (Fig. 10.24C). The mccA antisense RNA
is not produced, and because the RNA polymerase making
asRNA disengages, there is no polymerase collision. The
ubiG-mccBA operon mRNA is completed, MccA is made,
and cysteine is synthesized. Evidence suggests that asRNAs
in bacteria have a broad impact on microbial processes.

Riboswitches Sense
Cytoplasmic Molecules

Proteins are not the only molecules capable of recognizing
and binding to low-molecular-weight metabolites. RNA
A. Translational

molecules can do the same thing by folding into threedimensional structures. These RNA 3D structures bind
specific target metabolites much as a protein binds to its
substrate. Because of this property, some RNA molecules,
called ribozymes (or catalytic RNA), catalyze enzymatic
reactions. We already discussed how 23S rRNA forms the
peptidyltransferase activity of ribosomes (see Chapter 8).
Other RNA molecules, called riboswitches, resemble activator or repressor proteins in that they bind to a cell metabolite to control gene expression.
A riboswitch is typically found at the 5′ untranslated end
of an mRNA molecule, upstream of a coding sequence. The
riboswitch can assume two alternative stem loop structures
that switch back and forth in response to a target metabolite
(Fig. 10.25). Translation of the message or transcription of
the gene can be affected. For a riboswitch that affects translation (Fig. 10.25A), excess ligand (an amino acid or vitamin) will bind to the riboswitch and stabilize a 3D structure
that sequesters a ribosome-binding site (RBS). The buried
RBS prevents translation of the coding region. Without
ligand, an alternative structure forms that exposes the RBS,
and translation ensues. For riboswitches that affect transcription (Fig. 10.25B), binding of ligand prevents transcription termination. The coding region is expressed.

A pseudoknot contains at least two stem loop structures that form a knot-shaped three-dimensional conformation.

Riboswitches can recognize a diverse set of ligands,
including amino acids, vitamins, S-adenosylmethionine
(see above), thiamine pyrophosphate, and magnesium. Ron
Breaker’s laboratory at Yale University (Fig. 10.26) discovered an unusual riboswitch in bacteria and archaea that
specifically senses fluoride, not a cell metabolite. Fluoride
has been used for decades to inhibit dental caries, but it is
also abundant in Earth’s crust. The fluoride riboswitch was
found attached to genes such as enolase that are inhibited
by this halide. Fluoride buildup in bacteria will be detected
by the fluoride riboswitch, which triggers increased translation of the enzyme being inhibited. The result is increased
fluoride resistance of the microbe. Recent work has shown
that riboswitches can also regulate expression of noncoding
RNAs and control access to transcription termination factor
Rho or RNase E.

Changing the synthesis or activity of a sigma factor
will coordinately regulate a set of related genes. Sigma
factors can be controlled by altered transcription, translation, proteolysis, and anti-sigma factors.
Sporulation relies on the hierarchical activation of a
series of different sigma factors. Control mechanisms
include temporary asymmetrical chromosome distribution between the forespore and the mother cell, and
anti-sigma and anti-anti-sigma factors.
Small regulatory RNAs found within bacterial intergenic regions regulate the transcription or stability of
specific mRNA molecules and broaden the reach of protein regulators.
A cis-antisense RNA is an RNA produced from the
sense DNA strand of a protein-encoding gene and

affects expression of only that gene. These RNAs bind
to complementary target mRNA and either stabilize the
mRNA or make it susceptible to degradation.

RNA thermometers and riboswitches are secondary
structures at the 5′ end of specific mRNA molecules that
can obscure access to ribosome-binding sites or transcriptional terminator stems. Conditions that stabilize
the secondary structures (cold for RNA thermometers,
and small molecules for riboswitches) will alter translation of an mRNA or prematurely stop transcription.

Integrated Control Circuits

The regulatory circuits outlined to this point have involved
mostly single-switch mechanisms. But microbes build on
these mechanisms by combining multiple switches with
redundant feedback controls that can form a kind of integrated gene circuit. Integrated circuits can send a virus
down alternate lifestyle paths (lysis or lysogeny), couple the
genetic and biochemical control of a metabolic pathway
(ammonia assimilation), or time the events of a developmental cycle such as sporulation.
The deeper we delve into the regulatory workings that
govern the expression of a cell’s genome, the more clearly
we see the hierarchy of control. Groups of simple control
circuits are collectively regulated by other, more complex
circuits. One illustration of this hierarchy was already presented—namely, the role of cAMP and CRP in regulating
lactose and arabinose catabolism. The lacZYA and araBAD
operons are each controlled separately by dedicated regulatory switches—LacI and AraC, respectively. At a higher
level, however, both operons are coregulated by cAMP and

CRP in response to energy status (whether or not glucose
is present and utilized). The systems we are about to discuss represent complex examples of nature’s inventiveness
and need for control.
The first example we will look at here actually has
nothing to do with transcriptional/translational or posttranslational control of protein production. It does illustrate the concept of two-component signal transduction,
whereby one protein (the sensor kinase) senses a change in
the environment and transmits a signal (via phosphorylation) to the second component in the system (the response
regulator). Two-component signal transduction systems
can be used to control transcription, but they can also
be used to affect the physiology and behavior of a cell
without changing transcription. The example we will use
is chemotaxis, the ability of a bacterium to move toward
environments favorable to growth and away from harsh
environments.

Chemotaxis: How Bacteria Know
Where They Are Going

Bacteria that use flagella to move do not simply dash about
“hoping” they will swim in a favorable direction (presented
in Chapter 3). They have a sense about where they want
to go and where not to go. Bacteria such as E. coli purposefully move toward certain amino acids and carbohydrates present in media. They swim toward these chemicals
by sensing their gradients. Chemotaxis is the ability of an
organism to sense chemical gradients and modify its motility in response.
Before we discuss how these chemical gradients are
sensed, let’s first talk about how bacteria can change direction. Recall that the flagellar motor can rotate clockwise or
counterclockwise (see Section 3.6, Fig. 3.44) and that, on
any one bacterium, all motors coordinate their rotations.
Thus, all flagellar motors on a single cell will rotate clockwise (or counterclockwise), and then suddenly switch to
the opposite rotation. In the counterclockwise mode, all
flagella sweep behind the cell, forming a rotating bundle
that propels the organism forward in what is called smooth
swimming or a “run.” When flagellar rotors suddenly
switch to a clockwise rotation, the bundle is disrupted and
the bacterium “tumbles” in a random fashion. Once the
flagellar rotors switch back to counterclockwise rotation,
the bacterium will have reoriented itself in a different position, changing its swimming direction.
The key to chemotaxis is a mechanism that suppresses
the number of tumbles an organism makes when it moves
from a lower to higher concentration of an attractant chemical. For instance, an organism moving toward an attractant

may tumble only twice in 5 seconds. In contrast, an organism moving in the wrong direction (that is, toward a lower
concentration of attractant) may tumble eight times in 5
seconds. If, all of a sudden, the organism finds itself going
in the right direction, the sensory transduction system will
suppress the number of tumbles that occur, and the cell
will continue moving in the right direction.
This is the same strategy you use to find a hamburger
that you can smell cooking on a grill in your neighborhood
but cannot see. You randomly walk around until the smell
gets stronger, and then you keep moving in that direction
until someone hands you a burger.
How does the bacterium suppress tumble frequency?
Let’s start at the end of the system and work backward. The
natural bias of the flagellar rotor is counterclockwise rotation (in other words, smooth swimming). In order to tumble, the cell phosphorylates a protein called CheY. CheY-P
interacts with a rotor protein and flips the rotor in reverse
to turn clockwise (Fig. 10.27 , step 1). CheA protein is
the kinase that phosphorylates CheY and is the “key” to
chemotaxis. The more CheA kinase activity there is, the
more CheY-P is made, resulting in a higher frequency of
tumbling (reorienting) events. Another protein, CheZ,
continually dephosphorylates CheY. When E. coli senses an
attractant chemical like an amino acid at the cell surface,
the result is decreased CheA kinase activity, which leads to
lower CheY-P levels. The presence of fewer CheY-P molecules allows longer periods of counterclockwise rotation
and, consequently, extended smooth swimming toward the
attractant.
All this makes sense, but how does a cell “know” that it
has moved into an area with attractant? The answer begins
with clusters of special membrane-spanning proteins called
methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs, or chemoreceptors) located at the poles of E. coli and other bacteria (Fig. 10.27, step 1). The periplasmic domains of
different MCPs bind to different attractant molecules that
flow into the periplasm as the cell moves. The cytoplasmic
domain of each MCP binds to the CheA kinase noted earlier (via an intermediary protein, CheW) and controls CheA
activity. When a chemoattractant chemical, such as serine,
binds to the periplasmic side of the MCP, the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain changes and inhibits CheA
kinase activity (step 2). The CheY-P level then decreases
(because CheZ continues to dephosphorylate CheY-P), and
smooth swimming ensues.
This, too, makes sense when an organism first encounters a chemoattractant, but how does the cell know to keep
moving into even higher concentrations? As it happens, the
conformational change in the MCP that inactivates CheA
kinase activity also subjects the cytoplasmic side of the
MCP to methylation (via S-adenosylmethionine) by CheR

methylase (Fig. 10.27, step 3). Methylation of glutamate
residues in the cytoplasmic struts of the MCP reactivates
the CheA kinase but desensitizes the MCP so that an even
higher concentration of attractant must be present in order
to bind the MCP and inhibit CheA kinase. So, if the organism is moving into a higher concentration of attractant,
CheA is again inactivated, tumbling is suppressed, and the
cell prolongs the run. If it is not moving into higher concentrations of attractant, CheY-P is made again and the
organism will tumble. If the bacterium moves to a lower
concentration of attractant, the cell will keep tumbling at
a high frequency until it moves back into a higher concentration, at which point tumbling is suppressed to allow a
smooth run.
When the cell moves away from attractant, the methylation switch is reset by another protein, CheB-P, which
removes methyl groups so that the system is resensitized
to attractant (Fig. 10.27, step 4). The system is elegantly
fine-tuned in that CheA kinase is also the protein that

phosphorylates CheB. So, as the cell moves away from
attractant, CheA kinase phosphorylates CheY to produce
tumble, and it phosphorylates CheB to reset the sensitization switch.
MCP sensory proteins are not uniformly distributed
around the cell surface, but assemble as clusters at both
poles of E. coli. This clustering seems logical because the
bacterium points with its pole in the direction it swims.
Karen Lipkow (Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, University of Cambridge) and Peijun Zhang (University of
Pittsburgh) have used computer modeling and cryo-EM
tomography, respectively, to image the dynamics of chemotactic signaling and chemosensory arrays (Fig. 10.28).
Figure 10.28A depicts one such MCP cluster (yellow) at
one pole of the bacterium and illustrates the diffusion of
CheY-P toward the opposite pole. CheY-P will interact with
flagellar rotors all along the cell surface, causing tumble.

It is interesting to note that while the basic chemotactic
mechanism is evolutionarily conserved in bacteria, different genera use it differently. In the Gram-positive Bacillus
subtilis, for example, ligand binding to an MCP stimulates
CheA kinase, and CheY-P stimulates counterclockwise flagellar rotation and, thus, extended runs. This mechanism is
the exact opposite of that used in E. coli.
Chemotaxis is important for some obvious and perhaps
not so obvious reasons. It clearly provides a useful survival
strategy in nature, keeping bacteria moving toward nutrient and away from trouble (for example, toxic compounds).
For natural commensal bacteria or pathogens, however,
chemotaxis can also be used to move the organism toward
a cell surface to which it can attach. For example, the intestinal lining can exude chemical attractants that, like a beacon, will lead the bacteria in the intestine toward the cell
surface where they can attach. In sum, chemotactic sensory
perception plays a major role in structuring microbial communities, in affecting microbial activities, and in influencing various microbial interactions with the surroundings.
Other important regulatory mechanisms operate without
affecting gene expression. One intriguing system involving
toxin-antitoxin modules is described in eTopic 10.4.

Thought Question

10.9 Using antibody to flagella, we can tether a cell of E. coli

to a glass slide via a single flagellum. Looking through a
microscope, you will then see the bacterium rotate in opposite directions as the flagellar rotor switches from clockwise
to counterclockwise rotation and back again (see Fig. 10.27).
Which way will the bacillus rotate when an attractant is
added? What would the interval between clockwise and
counterclockwise switching be if you tethered the mutants
cheY, cheA, cheZ, and cheR to the slide and then added
attractant?

Biofilms and Second
Messengers: Cyclic Di-GMP

To change cell physiology, some stress-sensing proteins
produce second messenger molecules, which bind to
regulatory (or effector) proteins and change their activities. We have already discussed two second messenger
molecules: cAMP (involved in carbon/energy metabolism; see Section 10.2) and ppGpp (ribosome synthesis;
see Section 10.2). These molecules freely diffuse through

GGDEF and EAL proteins? One hypothesis is that cognate
pairs of these proteins may operate at separate locations within
a single cell and generate localized changes in c-di-GMP concentrations. Multiple, focused c-di-GMP gradients could
produce different outputs in different parts of a single cell.
Other examples of integrated control circuits are found
throughout the microbial world. Regulation of nitrogen assimilation, for example, integrates physiological and
genetic controls (discussed in Chapter 15). A classic example
of integrated control involves the “lifestyle” decisions made
by bacteriophage lambda, which are described in Chapter 11.

Methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) clustered at cell poles bind chemoattractants and initiate a

Gene switches can regulate “decision-making” processes in microbes.
Chemotaxis is a behavior in which motile microbes swim
toward favorable environments (chemoattractants) or
away from unfavorable environments (chemorepellents).
The direction of flagellar motor rotation determines the
type of movement. Counterclockwise rotation results in
smooth swimming; clockwise rotation results in tumbling.
Random movement toward an attractant causes a
drop in CheY-P levels, which enables counterclockwise
rotation and smooth swimming.

A discovery that fundamentally changed the way we think
about microbes was made during studies of Aliivibrio
fischeri, a peculiar marine microorganism that colonizes
the light organ of the Hawaiian bobtailed squid (Euprymna
scolopes) (Fig. 10.31). As discussed at the beginning of this
chapter, A. fischeri is bioluminescent but glows only at high
cell densities—a situation achieved naturally in the squid’s
colonized light organ or artificially in vitro (Fig. 10.31C
and D). What accounts for the dependence of gene expression on cell density? How do cells “know” they are crowded?
The phenomenon was originally dubbed quorum sensing
because it seemed akin to parliamentary rules of order that
require a minimum number of members (a quorum) to be
present at a meeting in order to conduct business. In the microbial world, however, gene regulation is only loosely associated

Bacterial genes are regulated by a hierarchy of regulators that form integrated gene circuits.

■ Microbial communication through quorum sensing. The lux system of Aliivibrio fischeri mediates that organism’s
bioluminescence. Synthesis and accumulation of an autoinducer (AI) trigger expression of the lux operon. The greater the cell number and the
smaller the container, the faster AI will accumulate. The resulting luciferase enzymes catalyze bioluminescence. The luciferase reaction, catalyzed by LuxA and LuxB, uses oxygen and reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to oxidize a long-chain aldehyde (RCHO) and, in the process,
produces blue-green light. Other lux gene products are involved in synthesis of the aldehyde.

with actual cell numbers. Induction of a quorum-sensing gene
system really requires the accumulation of a secreted small
molecule called an autoinducer (usually a homoserine lactone, although Gram-positive organisms are known to use
short peptides). The more cells there are in a discrete space,
the faster the critical level of autoinducer is reached.
At a certain extracellular concentration, the secreted
autoinducer reenters cells and binds to a regulatory molecule. In the case of A. fischeri, the regulatory molecule
is LuxR (Fig. 10.32 ). The LuxR-autoinducer complex activates transcription of the luciferase target genes
that confer bioluminescence. Luciferase is the enzyme
that produces light in A. fischeri. The apparent cell density requirement can be bypassed by the simple addition
of purified autoinducer to a low-density cell culture. Many
other microbes use these chemical languages to coordinate behavior of the population (Table 10.3). For instance,
quorum sensing is used by pathogens to time the production of virulence factors for optimum effect on the host.

Quorum Sensing and Pathogenesis

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a human pathogen that commonly infects patients with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease

of the lung. The organism forms a biofilm in the lung and
secretes virulence factors (such as proteases and other degradative enzymes) that destroy lung tissues (and thereby
severely compromise lung function). These virulence proteins, however, are not made until cell density is fairly
high—that is, at a point where the organism might have
a chance of overwhelming its host. Made too early, virulence proteins would alert the host to launch an immune
response. The induction mechanism involves two interconnected quorum-sensing systems, called Las and Rhl, both
composed of regulatory proteins homologous to LuxR and
LuxI of Aliivibrio fischeri. Many pathogens besides Pseudomonas appear to use chemical signaling to control virulence
genes. These include Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Vibrio
cholerae, the plant symbiont Rhizobium, and many others.

Interspecies Communication

Some microbial species not only chemically talk among
themselves but can communicate with other species. Vibrio
harveyi, for example, uses two different, but converging,
quorum-sensing systems to coordinate control of its luciferase. Both sensing pathways are very different from the
Aliivibrio fischeri system. One utilizes an acyl homoserine

with other V. harveyi cells. The second system produces
a different autoinducer (AI-2), which contains borate.
Because many species appear to produce this second signaling molecule, it is thought that mixed populations of
microbes use it to “talk” to each other. Recently, Karina
Xavier (Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal) demonstrated that E. coli engineered to overproduce AI-2 could
manipulate the composition of gut microbiota in mice.
In the case of V. harveyi, specific membrane sensor kinase proteins are used to sense each autoinducer
(Fig. 10.33). At low cell densities (no autoinducer), both
sensor kinases initiate phosphorylation cascades that converge on a shared response regulator, LuxO, to produce
phosphorylated LuxO. LuxO-P activates expression of
small RNAs called Qrr1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 that promote degradation of mRNA encoding the regulator LuxR, which is
needed to activate expression of the lux genes. Thus, at low

attach to Vibrio anguillarum bacterial cells in biofilms
(Fig. 10.36). They attach and remain there because the
bacterial cells produce AHL molecules that the zoospores
sense. Part of the evidence for this interdomain communication involved showing that the zoospores would even
attach to biofilms of E. coli carrying the Vibrio genes for
the synthesis of AHL. The implications of possible interdomain conversations are staggering. Does our microbiome
“speak” to us? Do we “speak” back? For further discussion of molecular communication between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes, see Chapter 21.
This knowledge begs the question, Why would a squid
want to harbor this bioluminescent microbe? Buried in the
sand by day, the squid emerges at night from its safe hiding
place to hunt for food. In moonlight, the squid would appear
as a dark silhouette from below, marking it as easy prey for
predators. It is thought that the squid camouflages itself by
projecting light downward from its light organ, giving the
appearance of surface-filtered light to predators below.

quorum sensing in Vibrio and Pseudomonas species. Other
organisms, such as Salmonella, have been shown to activate the AI-2 pathway of V. harveyi, dramatically supporting the concept of cross-species communication.

GENES AND GENOMES

SPECIAL TOPIC 10.1- - Networking with Nanotubes
Microbial communication by secreted molecules (quorum
sensing) is now a well-established phenomenon known to
synchronize group behaviors. But quorum sensing is a system more like a loudspeaker than a phone. Everyone in the
neighborhood, friend or foe, can potentially “hear” the signal. Another drawback to quorum sensing is that only small
molecules can be sent and received, and these molecules are
subject to degradation by extracellular factors. But what if
microbes had a one-on-one communication system (like texting) in which not only signaling molecules, but also enzymes,
DNA, or RNA, could be passed privately from one bacterium
to another without ever facing the extracellular environment—
temporarily changing the phenotype of the receiving cell?
Such a system was recently discovered by Gyanendra P.
Dubey and Sigal Ben-Yehuda from the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem (Fig. 1A). Using Bacillus subtilis as a model, these
scientists witnessed adjacent bacilli exchanging cellular materials such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), while cells separated by a very small distance could not. Electron microscopy
revealed how this was possible. Unexpectedly, the adjacent
cells were connected by small tubes called nanotubes (Fig. 1B).
These tubes were much larger (about 100 nm) than the bore
of an average pilus (about 5 nm). Not only were proteins transferred, but nanotubes also served as portals through which
DNA, RNA, and other molecules could be transferred. Unlike
quorum sensing, nanotube communications were private,
between one cell and another, although small, multicellular
networks connected by nanotubes were also observed.
Dubey and Ben-Yehuda found that nanotubes could also
form between different species of bacteria. Nanotube connections developed between two different Gram-positive species
(B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), and even between
Gram-positive (B. subtilis) and Gram-negative (E. coli) species

(Fig. 2A). Figure 2B shows the transfer of GFP from a gfp+ B.
subtilis to E. coli. The faint green speckled cells in Figure 2B
are E. coli that received GFP via nanotube transfer from an
adjacent B. subtilis.
Nanotube transfer of proteins could prove very beneficial
to members of mixed-species biofilms. Imagine that one cell
type in a biofilm is resistant to the antibiotic lincomycin, while
another cell type is sensitive to this antibiotic but resistant to
chloramphenicol. Could nanotubes help cells exchange resistance proteins, thereby providing each with a transient antibiotic resistance phenotype? Figure 3 illustrates that transient
nonhereditary phenotypes can be acquired by nanotube
exchanges. Figure 3A diagrams how two cells—one expressing lincomycin resistance, the other expressing chloramphenicol resistance—can exchange resistance proteins and possibly
mRNA through the nanotubes. Figure 3B shows the result of
an actual experiment. B. subtilis CmR cells (P1) and LinR cells
(P2) were grown on LB complex agar as individual or mixed
patches (column 1). Patches were transferred to fresh media
containing the drugs indicated. Notice that only the P1 + P2
mixed cells grew on the medium containing both Cm and
Lin. To see whether the resistance phenotype was heritable,
material from the patch was streaked for single colony isolation on LB (no drug), and individual colonies (arising from
single cells) were tested for drug resistance. Amazingly, each
colony exhibited resistance to one or the other drug only, indicating that double drug resistance was a transient, nonheritable phenotype (not the result of DNA transfer).
This mechanism of directly sharing resistance proteins
could be extremely valuable to a biofilm under assault by
multiple agents or even microbes under nutrient limitation.
A report in 2015 from Christian Kost’s laboratory at the Max
Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology shows that nanotubes

immediate transfer of information and materials across
inherent species barriers. Moreover, molecules channeled by
nanotubes are protected from degrading enzymes and harsh
environmental conditions. Though untested, nanotubes might
also be an efficient defensive strategy used to kill competitors
by directly delivering toxic molecules.

Quorum sensing involves the synthesis, secretion,
and extracellular accumulation of small autoinducer
signaling molecules. Cells within a population sense a
threshold concentration of autoinducer and simultaneously respond by expressing a subset of genes.
Quorum sensing enables communication between
cells of a single species or between multiple species.
Pathogens use quorum sensing to time the expression
of virulence genes during growth within a host.

Transcriptomics
and Proteomics

The studies exposing many of the regulatory systems discussed in this chapter were accomplished by examining
only a small number of genes at any one time. Now, however, new technologies enable scientists to examine thousands of genes or proteins in a single experiment.

A pebble tossed into a pond makes a wave that spreads
and ultimately disturbs the entire pond. Similarly, altering
one biochemical pathway in a cell produces a physiological
“wave” that impacts, to a greater or lesser degree, all other
pathways. What typically initiates and propagates a physiological “wave” is a transcriptional change in gene expression.
Scientists now have the ability to see these events unfold by
monitoring the expression of every gene in a cell—simultaneously. The result is known as the transcriptome.
This global view of gene expression is possible using
next-generation, high-throughput DNA sequencing
technology (see Section 7.6). However, mRNA is easily
degraded and has to be converted, molecule by molecule,
into more stable DNA in order to be counted. Basically, all
the RNA is extracted from a culture of cells, and then stable RNAs (tRNA and rRNA) comprising the bulk of RNA
are removed by hybridization. The remaining RNA molecules are fragmented by sonic disruption, and the fragments converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) with

Proteomics

If all the expressed mRNAs in a microbe make up its transcriptome, then all the expressed proteins form its proteome.
Unlike the DNA genome, which is fixed, the transcriptome
and proteome continually change in response to a changing environment. RNAseq and gene array technologies can
capture what happens transcriptionally, but gene arrays do
not necessarily reveal which proteins are actually expressed,
because stress can change the translation of a message without changing its transcription. Thus, the level of a protein
can increase significantly without any change in the amount
of mRNA. In addition, proteins undergo posttranslational
modifications (for example, acetylation, phosphorylation)

in response to different environments. The powerful techniques of 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The science of 2D

gels is described in eAppendix 3. Briefly, the technique uses
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to separate proteins from
cell extracts in one dimension by their charge and in a second dimension by their molecular weight. When combined,
isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE display a majority of the
cell’s proteins in a 2D array, as shown in Figure 10.38 (some
proteins do not appear, because their quantities or solubilities are too low). The proteins are visualized by staining
with fluorescent dyes after separation. Subsequent computer
analysis of the proteome patterns obtained from cells grown
under two different conditions will reveal proteins whose
levels increase or decrease in response to the changing environment. Figure 10.38 shows a dual-channel image analysis that compares Bacillus subtilis proteomes from cultures
grown in a minimal glucose medium with or without amino

reverse transcriptase. The number of cDNA fragments
made corresponds to the number of transcripts present in
the cell extract. DNA adapters are ligated to each end of the
cDNA molecules. Each molecule, with or without amplification, is then sequenced in a high-throughput manner (for example, Illumina’s sequencing by synthesis) to
obtain short sequences from one end or both ends of each
fragment (corresponding to transcript copy). The reads,
millions of them, are typically 30–400 bp. A computer program aligns each sequence with its genome position (gene)
and then tabulates the number of fragments sequenced at
any one location. The number of RNA sequences (RNAseq data) found for a particular gene is proportional to how
much that gene was expressed.
Comparing results between cells grown under different
conditions, or between a mutant and a wild-type strain, will
expose how the expression of every gene is influenced by
the change. Figure 10.37, for instance, illustrates the effect
of sigma S on the expression of acid resistance genes in E.
coli. E. coli can survive pH 2 exposures for long periods of
time—a property known as acid resistance. This capability requires numerous genes, as shown in the top panel of
the figure. Tyrrell Conway and colleagues at the University
of Oklahoma used deep sequencing to quantify the transcript levels of these genes in wild-type and rpoS mutants of
E. coli lacking sigma S. E. coli rpoS mutants are highly
sensitive to acidic environments like stomach contents.
Figure 10.37 compares the expression of these genes
in wild-type (panels 2 and 4) and RpoS-deficient strains
(panels 3 and 5). Note that transcripts of all of these
genes are decreased in the acid-sensitive rpoS mutant.
Another powerful technique, called DNA microarray, can also simultaneously examine the expression of
every gene in a cell. For an organism like Salmonella
Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever, this requires
seeing more than 4,600 genes. All of this can be done
on a slide the size of a postage stamp. The microarray
technique is described in eAppendix 3.

ism’s genome gives us a wealth of useful information
and new ways to probe its physiology. One of those ways
involves mass spectrometry, which experimentally determines the exact mass of an unknown protein or peptide
fragment and uses that mass to identify the protein. The
process is easy for a single protein picked from a gel, but
new techniques make it possible to identify and quantify
proteins from whole-cell extracts.
To begin the analysis, proteins present in cell extracts
are digested into distinct peptide fragments with a site-specific protease (trypsin) (Fig. 10.39). The fragment mixture
is passed through an analytical column that separates peptides according to differences in hydrophobicity or some
other parameter (Fig. 10.39, steps 1–3). The column effluent is then directly fed through tandem mass spectrometry
(MS-MS) instrumentation (step 4). In MS-MS, each proteolytic fragment is subfragmented by ionization to produce progressively smaller secondary fragments missing one
or more amino acids. Because the weight of each amino
acid is distinct, MS-MS analysis can determine the amino
acid sequence of the initial proteolytic fragment (step 5).
Sophisticated computer programs identify the proteins by
comparing the amino acid sequences of each protein fragment with the predicted sequences of proteolytic fragments
from all ORFs in a genome (steps 6 and 7).
Can we also use mass spectrometry to quantify a given
protein in two different samples? Determining relative
quantities of a protein between experimental samples typically involves labeling peptides with isobaric tags before
MS-MS analysis (Fig. 10.40). Isobaric tags have two
parts: a reporter group and a balance group. The masses
of reporter groups from different tags differ slightly. However, the masses of the balance groups also differ, such that
all the intact isobaric tags have the same initial mass. Cell
proteins from different experimental samples are digested
by trypsin, and the peptide fragments from each sample
are collectively labeled with different isobaric tags. That
is, one sample’s peptides are all modified with an isobaric
tag whose reporter group’s mass differs slightly from the
reporter group of an isobaric tag used to mark peptides
from a different sample. But because each reporter group
is linked to a balance group, all tags for all samples have
the same initial mass (that is, they are isobaric). The two
samples are then mixed and run through MS-MS analysis.
Each peptide peak will contain representatives from both
samples because their masses are the same. Subsequent ionization of a single peptide will release the different mass

Concluding Thoughts

Transcriptomic and proteomic technologies have been
used for many microbial applications. One fascinating
example centers on the transcriptional events that occur
during the developmental cycle of Caulobacter crescentus.
This organism progresses from a nonreplicating swimming
form (swarmer cell) to a sessile stalked form that can replicate to make more swarming offspring. DNA microarray
and proteomic analysis have revealed several potential regulators of this complex developmental process. Bioinformatic
approaches have also been applied to human body odor.

Bacteria employ a vast array of regulatory mechanisms,
both simple and complex, to make survival decisions. But
do they possess cognitive ability? This is a controversial
idea, but one worth pondering. Cognition in its broadest sense is the process of acquiring, processing, storing,
and acting on information from the environment. Memory, for instance, is critical to cognition. Chemotactic bacteria use arrays of methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins
to remember where it is in a chemical gradient. The information acquired is then used to guide decisions about cell
movement. Two-component signal transduction systems,
prominent in bacteria, contribute to cognition if the systems cross-talk. Bacterial signal transduction systems crosstalk when a histidine kinase phosphorylates a noncognate
response regulator. Small RNA molecules also contribute to system cross talk by influencing disparate regulatory systems. Higher-order manifestations of cognition

11.1 Phage Lambda: Enteric Bacteriophage

How does an endogenous retrovirus
contribute to the human genome?

Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are
remnants of ancient retroviral infections and comprise about 8% of the
human genome. Major evolutionary
innovations, such as placentation, have
been associated with the co-option
of ERV sequences for regulatory functions. One human ERV
(HERV) subtype, HERV-K, is of particular interest, as it is the
most recently acquired HERV in the human genome from
which multiple insertions have retained protein-coding potential. Remarkably, HERV-K virus-like particles and Gag proteins
are readily detected in human blastocysts, indicating that early
human development proceeds in the presence of retroviral
products.
What do you find most exciting about the implications for
virology and human biology?
From the human development perspective, these results
argue that complex interactions between HERV-encoded
retroviral products and host factors fine-tune regulatory
properties of early human development. Moreover, HERVs
can rewire developmental networks via their functions as
promoters or enhancers for human genes. Furthermore,
HERVs are also interesting from a human evolution perspective, as they can be exapted (evolve a new function) in a lineage-specific manner as human-specific enhancers.

Discovery of Phage Lambda

Bacteriophage lambda was discovered in 1950 by Esther
Lederberg (1922–2006), pioneering bacterial geneticist at
the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and later Stanford
University (Fig. 11.2). At the time, it was known that some
kinds of bacteria spontaneously lyse and release phages, but
the mechanism, even the source of phage from within the
cells, was a mystery. The strain Escherichia coli K-12 had
been isolated in 1922 from a healthy patient’s colon and
was used for decades thereafter in teaching and research. In
1950, Lederberg was performing a genetic cross between
two strains of E. coli K-12: a standard laboratory stock, and
a strain that she had mutagenized with ultraviolet light.
After the two strains were mixed, the mutant strain formed
colonies that were “nibbled and plaqued” (Fig. 11.3A).
The plaques resulted from phage particles lysing the mutant
strain. The mutant had lost its lambda prophage and was
therefore susceptible to infection. The infecting phage particles came from the lysogenic E. coli K-12, which Lederberg had streaked across.
Further experiments confirmed that at that time, all
known stocks of K-12, the most widely used strain of E.
coli, were lysogenic for phage lambda. Lysogeny means
that the genome of a phage is incorporated into the
genome of the host cell (discussed in Chapter 6). As the
host cell then reproduces, phage particles no longer exist
as such, but the phage DNA replicates indefinitely within
the host, as an integrated prophage. The presence of
the prophage confers resistance to infection by the same
type of phage. Phage lambda is thus called a “temperate
phage,” rather than a “virulent phage” such as T4, which
always kills its host. But occasionally (about once in a million cells), a molecular signal tells the prophage genes to

FIGURE 11.3 ■ A lysogen reveals phage lambda. A. The

plaques in a susceptible E. coli strain (horizontal streak). B. Lambda

make progeny phages and lyse the cell. Thus, unknown
to researchers at the time, a given tube of growing E. coli
lysogen typically carried about a million lambda phages
per milliliter. The phages released can form plaques on
a strain that is not a lysogen (has no lambda prophage)
(Fig. 11.3B). The plaques have a cloudy center because
some of the infected cells become lysogens, which start
growing up where the infection began.
Lederberg and others learned to “cure” the K-12 lysogen to eliminate the phage from stock cultures, including
most strains used today. Other notable discoverers of the
nature of lysogeny include French microbiologists André
Lwoff (1902–1994) and François Jacob (1920–2013). The
molecular basis of the lysis/lysogeny “switch” was elucidated by Mark Ptashne and colleagues (discussed shortly).

measure protein” (protein H). If we delete part of the gene
encoding the tape measure protein, the phage will assemble
a shorter tail. On the other hand, if the gene is lengthened
by addition of nucleotides, the phage will make a longer
tail. How the “tape measure” works is unclear.
With respect to function, the tail of all siphophages is
noncontractile (unlike the contractile tail of myophages
such as phage T4; eTopic 11.1). The tail tube has a tip and
tail fibers, both of which help the phage attach to its host
cell. Upon host attachment, the lambda DNA must uncoil
and pass through the entire length of the tail to reach the
host cytoplasm.
Genome. Phage lambda has a genome of 48.5 kilobase
pairs (kb) that includes about 70 genes. In Figure 11.5,
the left side of the genome encodes mainly components
of the virion, including head, tail, and tail fibers. Most of
these genes are color-coded to match their products, shown
in Figure 11.4. The right side of the genome includes
enzymes for key functions such as host integration, DNA
replication and lysis, and the famous lysis/lysogeny switch
(discussed shortly).
Within a phage head, the packaged genome is linear. The
left and right ends each possess cos, a sequence of 200 bp
that was cleaved by a terminase enzyme when the phage
DNA was packaged. The cleavage generated a staggered
cut or “sticky ends” (Fig. 11.6). As the phage DNA now
enters the new host cell, the cos sticky ends anneal together,
and their backbones are sealed by DNA ligase (a replication enzyme discussed in Chapter 7). The genome is now
circular, as the sealed ends form a long operon transcribed
“rightward” from PR , all the way through the virion structural components (Fig. 11.5). Another operon is transcribed “leftward,” from PL. Note that both the PR and PL
operons use all three reading frames, and that some coding genes overlap. Long mRNA transcripts with gene overlap in three reading frames are a common feature of viral
genomes.
Besides the PR and PL promoters, which function during
the lytic cycle, other promoters are used for key events of
the lysis/lysogeny switch.
During the lytic cycle, the circularized DNA molecule
undergoes several rounds of bidirectional replication via
host DNA polymerase (Fig. 11.6). The DNA is sometimes called a “theta form” because of the shape of the
circle while replication is in progress. The completed circles are then nicked (cleaved on one strand), generating
a 3′ OH end. The 3′ OH end of DNA serves as a primer
for rolling-circle replication. Rolling-circle replication is
commonly used by plasmids (see Chapter 7), as well as by
circularized viral genomes such as that of herpes viruses
(see Section 11.5). In the rolling-circle process, one strand
of DNA extends its 3′ end continually around the circular
template, while the 5′ end “rolls away.” The 5′ extension

suppose multiple phage particles coinfect the cell at the
same time. This event implies that the host population
is outnumbered by phages, and thus progeny phages will
have poor opportunities to find a host. For this reason the
phage has evolved a mechanism to avoid lytic reproduction:
The multiple phages express a higher level of CII, some of
which now evades the host protease and blocks Cro. When
CII blocks Cro, the fortunate host cell becomes a lysogen
instead of lysing. A phage genome integrates in the host
genome as a prophage, at the att site. The phage DNA
integrates with att by site-specific recombination—that is,
recombination between the backbones of two DNAs that
share a short sequence in common (discussed in Chapter 9).
The integrated prophage now expresses only a few proteins, including CI (lambda repressor). CI repressor prevents
the lytic cycle by blocking transcription of lytic promoters. The CI repressor also prevents superinfection by other
lambda phages. This is what happens to most of your intestinal bacteria between meals: the bacteria stay in stationary phase with their lysogenic phages repressed. The phage
lambda CI repressor is famous, because its binding to DNA
was the first protein-DNA binding event to be described
(Fig. 11.9). Mark Ptashne at Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center (Fig. 11.9B) showed how CI protein forms
a dimer that binds a specific DNA sequence. Each CI subunit binds DNA through an interaction between an alpha
helix of the protein and a major-groove sequence of DNA
(Fig. 11.9A). Similar alpha helix binding to the major
groove mediates the function of many genetic regulators of
animals and plants, as well as bacteria.
When phage lambda infects E. coli, what if the Cro control wins, instead of CI? Cro protein represses CI expression, thus promoting the lytic cycle. The lytic cycle leads to
lysis (host cell destruction, and release of progeny phages).
The circularized phage DNA replicates, first bidirectionally (Fig. 11.8, step 5, “theta replication”), and then by

synthesized and assembled to form the empty capsid (or
head coat), tail tube, and tail fibers (step 7). The cos end
of the DNA concatemer gets stuffed into a progeny head
coat (step 8). The stuffed portion of the concatemer is then
cleaved at the next cos site by a phage enzyme called terminase. Terminase also helps attach the filled head to the
tail tube. When most of the progeny phages have assembled, a phage-encoded protein called holin punctures the
inner cell membrane, providing a channel through which

the CI repressor blocks expression of nearly
all other genes from the promoters PL and PR
(Fig. 11.10B). These two promoters, particularly PR , express most of the phage structural
proteins and lytic enzymes from the circularized lambda genome (see Fig. 11.5). But
the number of repressor molecules present in
a cell is small enough for fluctuation to lead
to rare events. Occasionally, perhaps one in
107 cells, the CI concentration is lowered to a
level at which PR becomes exposed, allowing
expression of Cro. CI is further decreased by
host RecA, which cleaves this protein along
with many host repressors (Fig. 11.10A).
RecA is activated by DNA damage during
UV light exposure, so UV light can induce
lysis in 100% of a lysogenic population.
When Cro is expressed, this protein
binds to both operators (OL and OR) for the

CHAPTER 11

PL and PR operons, respectively. Cro regulates these operons during the lytic cycle and, at the same time, blocks
expression of CI from promoter PRM. Thus, no further
repressor can be made to block phage production, and the
cell is committed to lysis.
Maintaining lysogeny. To avoid lysis requires continual
expression of CI repressor (Fig. 11.10B). Early in lysogeny,
CI is expressed from promoter PRE. CI expression requires
PRE to bind CII protein. But CII protein is vulnerable to
cleavage by host Hfl B (in a high-nutrient medium). Hfl B
cleavage can be prevented by CIII, a protein expressed early
from promoter PL .
Once CI protein attains sufficient concentration, it activates its own expression from a different promoter, PRM. PRM
activation requires CI dimers binding to OR . Besides activating PRM, the CI binding also blocks expression of PR ,
the major lytic operon, as well as the leftward-transcribing
operon from PL. From then on, CI maintains its own expression while preventing induction of lysis. Lysis occurs only
when stress such as DNA damage activates RecA to cleave CI.
The full repression of lysis requires eight molecules of CI
in all: a pair of dimers at OR , and another pair of dimers at
OL (Fig. 11.10C). The two pairs of dimers actually bind
each other as an octamer, with DNA looped between them
(not shown). The multiple molecules working together
show “cooperativity,” a property whereby the binding of
two regulators is stronger than the sum of the individual
regulators binding DNA. Cooperativity increases the on/
off character of a molecular switch, lessening the occurrence of partial states in between. Other examples of cooperative molecular regulators are presented in Chapter 10.

Synthetic Biology

Within natural microbiomes such as that of our intestine,
lysogenic phages carry genes that offer useful functions to
their host bacterium. An example is the bor gene (found at
the right-hand end of the lambda genome; see Fig. 11.5).
The bor gene is not needed for phage function; it encodes
Bor lipoprotein, which resides in the outer membrane of
the host bacterium. The presence of Bor protects a lysogen from destruction by the serum complement cascade
(described in Chapter 23). The location of the bor gene
near the end of the phage genome suggests that it could
have been picked up from an ancestral host, by a process
of specialized transduction (see Chapter 9). In specialized
transduction, a prophage initiates lysis and picks up a small
adjacent piece of host DNA while copying its genome out
of the integration site. The host DNA is then copied into
progeny phage and is transferred to the next host infected.
Today, we use genetic elements of the lambda switch for
synthetic biology—in effect, imitating natural gene transfer

mechanisms to construct bacteria with functions useful to
us. For example, Pamela Silver’s students used a CI/Cro
switch to build a bacterial recorder that detects an environmental signal within the intestine. This kind of bacterial
device offers promise for future development of diagnostic
and therapeutic tools.
Silver’s bacterial recorder possesses a stripped-down version of the CI/Cro switch (Fig. 11.11A). The cro gene is
fused to lacZ, whose product generates blue colonies when
expressed on indicator plates. (Gene fusion techniques are
presented in Chapter 12.) But cro expression from PR is
blocked by CI repressor, which in turn is expressed from
PRM. Cro would block PRM—if it were expressed. The net
result is colonies that are white.
The same bacteria contain another fragment of the lambda
switch, the “trigger element,” in which Cro is expressed from
a gene under control of the antibiotic-inducible promoter
tetP. Now, suppose we add the inducing antibiotic (ATC)
to the bacteria. The tetP-cro trigger element now expresses
Cro, which represses expression of CI by binding PRM. With
CI expression turned off, the cro-lacZ fusion indefinitely
expresses its protein, causing blue colonies (Fig. 11.11B).
The blue phenotype recurs for many generations.
What happens when we put this bacterial recorder into the
microbiome of a mouse? First, to colonize the mouse intestine, the bacterium needs to include a selective gene for competitive advantage within the microbial community—a gene
conferring resistance to streptomycin. The mice are treated
with streptomycin (Fig. 11.11C) until the bacterial recorders are established. Then the researcher adds the test antibiotic ATC. After ATC is removed, bacteria are sampled from
mice fecal pellets. For up to 7 days following ATC removal,
blue colonies appear, showing that the bacteria record ATC
exposure and report it long after the signal has gone.
Other applications of phage lambda sound more like science fiction. In 2015, Ido Yosef and colleagues at Tel Aviv
University constructed a lambda phage that specifically
kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria, while sparing bacteria
that lack antibiotic resistance. The phage actually delivers a
CRISPR-Cas defense to its host, protecting the host from
phage lysis. In a different kind of experiment, physicists at
the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, used
a Cro switch to build an “artificial cell” on a DNA chip.
This partly biological device is used to study biochemical
networks relevant to medicine. There is no end in sight to
future applications of the familiar phage lambda.

The phage lambda virion consists of a head containing its DNA genome and accessory proteins, a
tail composed of an internal tube, and tail fibers.
Phage lambda binds to the host maltose porin.
Phage DNA is inserted into the cytoplasm, where
early phage genes are expressed.
Control proteins bind to DNA, leading to lysis
or lysogeny. Single-phage infection (Cro protein)
leads to lysis, whereas multiple-phage infection
(CII protein) more likely leads to lysogeny.
In a lytic cycle, rolling-circle replication generates progeny genomes. The progeny genomes
are packaged into head coats and then cleaved
from the concatemer; the filled heads are attached
to tails. Late-expressed proteins lead to lysis.
CII up-regulates expression of CI repressor,
which maintains lysogeny. CI then induces its
own expression, while repressing expression of Cro
and proteins of the lytic cycle. Human gut bacteria frequently switch between lysis and lysogeny.
The CI/Cro switch is used for synthetic biology. The molecular switch is built into biomedical devices.

Virion Structure and Genome

The influenza virion has an asymmetrical structure
(Fig. 11.12). Instead of an icosahedral capsid, the (–) strand
RNA genome segments are individually coated by nucleocapsid proteins (NPs). The term “nucleocapsid” refers generally
to proteins coating a viral genome and packaged within or as
part of the virion. The NP-coated RNA segments are loosely
contained by a shell of matrix proteins (M1). The matrix
layer is further enclosed by the envelope. The envelope derives
from the phospholipid membrane of the host cell, which
incorporates viral proteins such as hemagglutinin (HA) and
neuraminidase (NA). These viral envelope proteins join the
membrane to the enclosed matrix, maintaining its structure.
When a newly formed virion exits its host cell, neuraminidase
acts as an enzyme to cleave a cell membrane glycoprotein,
thus releasing the virion outside the
cell. Neuraminidase can be blocked
by the antiviral agent Tamiflu (oseltamivir), one of the main drugs available to treat influenza.

Genome of influenza A. The influenza genome consists of eight RNA segments,

each encoding one or two proteins. Each (–) strand segment must be transcribed to a (+) strand mRNA
with a host-derived 5′ cap and viral RNA polymerase, and a 3′ poly-A tail (AAA-OH3′) consisting of a
variable number of adenine nucleotides with a 3′ hydroxyl end. Two of the segments (7 and 8) are processed further to express two additional proteins (M2 and NS2).

expressed in the previous host, before the virions formed
and the cell lysed. Within the virion, each RNA segment
forms a loop, complexed with NP subunits that condense the RNA in a helix. (The helix does not involve
base pairs, and differs from the standard helical forms
of RNA.) The two ends of RNA are complexed with the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, poised for RNA synthesis early in infection.
Segmented genome. Influenza virus has a segmented

genome consisting of multiple separate nucleic acids, like
the multiple chromosomes of a eukaryotic cell. The influenza genome includes eight segments, each a separate
linear (–) strand of RNA encoding one or two products
(Figs. 11.12 and 11.14). Within the infected cell, each (–)
strand segment must be transcribed to a (+) strand mRNA
with a host-derived 5′ cap and viral RNA polymerase, and a
3′ poly-A tail (AAA-OH3′) typical of eukaryotic mRNA. If
two different strains of influenza virus infect a host simultaneously, their segments can reassort to generate a novel
hybrid strain. Because influenza genomes are capable of
reassortment, they can rapidly generate a new strain that
our immune system fails to recognize, such as the pandemic H1N1 strain of 2009 (discussed shortly). At the
same time, like the other viruses, influenza viruses continually acquire small mutations that can lead to new phenotypes with respect to drug resistance and host range. The
double threat of drastic change and subtle smaller changes
in its genome explains why influenza presents a huge global
challenge for public health.

Thought Question

11.5 Could the influenza genome change by recombination of
segments, rather than reassortment? What about the lambda
phage genome?

Given that viral infection requires all eight segments,
how does the assembly mechanism package exactly eight
segments, one of each? Until recently, EM imaging of influenza virions suggested that the RNA genome segments
are packaged at random, avoiding the energetic expense
of an accurate packaging mechanism. Random packaging
would result in a vast majority of defective particles. But
the relatively large eukaryotic host cell can produce 10,000
progeny virions, more than enough infective particles to
propagate the virus.
More advanced imaging, however, shows that, in fact,
the eight segments package precisely within the virion.
The segments appear to link to each other in order as
they arrange themselves. Figure 11.13B shows the evidence from cryo-electron tomography (a high-resolution
EM technique described in Chapter 2). Cryo-EM combined images from frozen unstained virus particles, whose

CHAPTER 11

structure appeared highly consistent (unlike those imaged
by earlier kinds of EM). The computed images show sections across the influenza virion, in which all eight RNA
segments stand side by side, like a bundle of sticks. Sections
taken from different depths through the particle reveal tiny
molecular connections between adjacent segments. Further experiments with genetic constructs and fluorescence
microscopy confirm that all eight unique segments link
together in a defined, reproducible pattern.
Reassortment of virulent strains. The key advantage of a

segmented genome is that it enables reassortment between
two strains coinfecting the same cell. Reassortment leads
to “antigenic shift,” in which a very different strain evades
the host immune system. Even strains that infect animals

such as ducks or swine may reassort their segments with
those of a coinfecting human virus. Influx of genes from
a distantly related strain can sharply increase virulence and
mortality. For example, the 1968 Hong Kong flu strain,
which killed over 33,000 people in the United States,
derived three segments from avian strains. Major epidemics
of exceptionally virulent influenza arise as a result of reassortment with genome segments from strains that evolved
within ducks or swine, agricultural animals that live in
close proximity to humans. In each genome, the “H” and
“N” numbers designate alleles of the genes encoding envelope proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, respectively. For example, the Hong Kong flu strain had alleles
H3 and N2 (which have since become prevalent in “seasonal” human flu strains).

GENES AND GENOMES

In 1979, in Europe, an avian flu strain was found to
have “jumped” into swine (the “avian-like” swine strain).
In 1992, a triple-reassortant strain was identified that
included segments PB2 and PA (encoding RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase) from an avian virus; PB1 (polymerase
subunit), NP (nucleocapsid), and M (matrix protein) from
a swine virus; and PB, H, and N from a human seasonal
strain of influenza A. Since the H and N envelope proteins
came from a human strain, the triple reassortant could be
transmitted readily between humans. Today, molecular surveillance reveals many emerging strains of human influenza
A that combine avian and swine alleles. The “swine” strain
in 2009 had alleles H1 and N1, similar to the pandemic
1918 strain (Fig. 11.15B). In 2009, prompt public health
measures such as quarantine helped keep the disease rate
low. Yet another reassortant avian strain, H7N9, emerged
in China in 2013. So far, these avian strains have been contained—but the next time we may be less fortunate.

envelope. Cleavage of hemagglutinin enables a small peptide called the fusion peptide to mediate viral entry into
the host cell (discussed shortly; see Fig. 11.17). The presence of the protease is one host factor that determines
which kind of host may be infected, and which tissues
within the host support viral replication. Host factors of
many kinds mediate viral infections.
Influenza receptor is a sialic acid glycoprotein. Another
important host factor for influenza is cell-surface glycoproteins that contain a terminal sialic acid (Fig. 11.16). The
sialic acid polysaccharide of the glycoprotein binds hemagglutinin, attaching the virion and enabling endocytosis.
The precise structure of the sialic acid host receptor may
determine whether a strain such as avian influenza H5N1
will spread directly between humans. For example, the
sialic acid connection in the receptor polysaccharide can
involve different OH groups of the sugar galactose: a linkage to the OH-3 (alpha-2,3) or to the OH-6 (alpha-2,6)
bond (Fig. 11.16). The influenza strain H5N1 recognizes
mainly the alpha-2,3-linked protein, found in birds. In
humans, the upper respiratory tract contains mainly alpha2,6-linked receptors; alpha-2,3-linked receptors are found
only deeper within the lungs. But swine carry receptors

■ Influenza receptors in different hosts. The avian host receptor
polysaccharide contains sialic acid with an alpha-2,3 bond to galactose, whereas the human
receptor in the upper respiratory tract has an alpha-2,6 bond. Swine receptors include both
forms of sialic acid; thus, swine can be infected by both avian and human strains and may act as
a “mixing bowl” for reassortment.

of both types. For this reason, swine are believed to act
as a “mixing bowl” for strains from birds and humans, as
well as swine. Thus, swine incubated the avian strain in
1979, and then allowed later reassortment with human-flu
genome segments, leading eventually to the 2009 strain—
which sickened both pigs and humans. Today, large swine
facilities are monitored for appearance of novel reassortant
strains.

The avian influenza strain H5N1 causes exceptionally high mortality in humans, but it is rarely transmitted from one person to another. More rapid transmission
could arise from antigenic drift, a small mutation in the
gene encoding avian hemagglutinin. Rapid person-toperson transmission of H5N1 might cause an influenza
pandemic with high mortality. That is why public health

FIGURE 11.17 ■ Influenza virion attachment to receptor, acid activation, and

Endocytosis of the influenza
virion involves a key step of acidmediated membrane fusion, which
offers a target for antiviral agents
(Fig. 11.17 ). As the influenza
vvirion binds its sialic acid receptor (Fig. 11.17, step 1), a host
protease cleaves each HA, forming a fusion peptide (step 2). The
hemagglutinin trimer now contains three N-terminal fusion peptides. A fusion peptide is a portion
of an envelope protein (cleaved
from hemagglutinin in the case
of influenza virus) that changes
conformation so as to facilitate
envelope fusion with the host cell
membrane.
When the virion is taken up by
endocytosis, the endocytic vesicle
fuses with a lysosome and its interior acidifies (Fig. 11.17, step 3).
The lowered pH (increased H+ concentration) drives H+ ions into the
virion through the M2 ion channel
in the matrix layer (see Fig. 11.12
for virion structure). The influx
of acid causes the matrix proteins
to dissociate from the NP-coated
RNA. M2 ion channel is the target
of amantadine, one of the first antiinfluenza drugs; unfortunately, most
strains today have evolved resistance
to the drug. Low pH also induces

Replication Cycle of Influenza A

The replication of influenza virus requires that the viral
components travel in and out of the nucleus (Fig. 11.18 ).
Several viral enzymes and structural proteins travel along
with its genetic material. As progeny envelope proteins are
made, they require transport through the ER and Golgi to
the cell membrane. The overall replication cycle is highly
complex—even in the simplified diagram shown here.

Synthesis of (+) strand mRNA. After the influenza virion

is endocytosed (Fig. 11.18, step 1), all the viral (–) RNA
segments are released in the cytoplasm (step 2). Each RNA
retains its coat of nucleocapsid proteins, as well as a prepackaged RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The NP-coated
RNA segments individually pass through a nuclear pore
into the nucleus (step 3). Within the nucleus, each genomic
(–) RNA segment with its prepackaged polymerase synthesizes (+) strand RNA for mRNA (step 4). Each mRNA
synthesis initiates with a 7-methylguanine-“capped” RNA
fragment (labeled “C” in the figure). The influenza polymerase obtains the cap fragments from the host by cleaving
them from host nuclear pre-mRNA—a process quaintly
known as “cap snatching.” The (+) strand mRNA molecules return to the cytoplasm for translation (step 5), using
the snatched cap to bind the host ribosome. The RNA segments encoding envelope proteins attach to the ER for protein synthesis and transport to the host cell membrane (step
6). The newly synthesized nucleocapsid proteins (NPs), as
well as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase components,

subsequently return to the nucleus (step 7). Other genomepackaging proteins (M1 and NS2) also return to the
nucleus.
Synthesis of (+) strand and (–) strand genomic RNA. Back
in the nucleus, the original (–) strand RNA segments also
serve as templates for RNA synthesis, without cap snatching (Fig. 11.18, step 8). The uncapped (+) strand RNA
then becomes coated with the newly made NP subunits
imported from the cytoplasm. The NP-coated (+) strand
serves as template to synthesize (–) strand RNA (step 9),
which also becomes coated with NP (step 10).
The NP-coated (–) RNA associates with a newly made
polymerase for a future cycle of viral replication. The RNA
is then complexed with matrix protein (M1) and nuclear
export protein (NS2)—proteins that were imported from
the cytoplasm earlier. At last, the fully packaged (–) RNA
segments exit the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 11.18,
step 11), where they approach the cell membrane for packaging into progeny virions (step 12).

Envelope synthesis and assembly. The envelope proteins

synthesized at the ER include hemagglutinin (HA) and
neuraminidase (NA). Within the ER lumen, these proteins
are glycosylated by host enzymes and then transferred to
the Golgi (Fig. 11.18, step 13) for export to the cell membrane (step 14). Within the cell membrane, the envelope
proteins assemble around a group of (–) RNA segments
complexed with their matrix and packaging proteins, completing the virion particle (step 15).
To exit the cell, the virion buds out (Fig. 11.18,
step 16). Viral exit requires a final step of host release:
Neuraminidase (the envelope protein N) cuts the sialic acid
link of the host glycoproteins (step 17), releasing the virion
out into the bloodstream. This host release activity of neuraminidase is inhibited by oseltamivir (Tamiflu), the main
antiviral agent currently useful against influenza. Tamiflu remains useful today, but resistant strains of the 2009
H1N1 virus have emerged, so we urgently need new antivirals ahead of the next influenza pandemic.
Experimental evidence. How do researchers figure out all
the steps of replication shown in Figure 11.18? A key technique is fluorescence microscopy, as described in Chapters 2

A infection was observed using MDCK cells, a standard
laboratory culture derived from canine kidney tissue. The
infected cells were simultaneously probed with RNA molecules complementary to four different influenza segments
(PB1, PB2, NP, PA). The complementary RNA probes were
linked to four different fluorophores with different excitation-emission properties. Thus, the positions of progeny
viral RNA segments (vRNAs) were detected and assigned
four different colors. The “merge” panel shows how many
of the different fluorophore positions overlap (white dots).
The overlap of colors from different types of segments suggests that vRNAs are already linking together as they exit
the nucleus (Fig. 11.18, step 11) and enter the cytoplasm
for assembly into virions. Such ingenious experiments continually require us to rewrite the textbooks.

Influenza virus causes periodic pandemics of respiratory disease. New virulent strains arise through reassortment of human, avian, and swine strains.
The influenza virus consists of segmented (–) strand
RNA. Each segment is packaged with nucleocapsid proteins. Segments from different strains reassort through
coinfection.
Nucleocapsid and matrix proteins enclose the RNA
segments of the influenza virus. The matrix is surrounded by an envelope containing spike proteins.
Envelope HA proteins mediate virion attachment.
The HA protein includes a fusion peptide that undergoes conformational change to cause fusion between the
viral envelope and host cell membrane. For influenza,
the virion is internalized by endocytosis.

viral mRNAs return to the cytoplasm for translation.
Genomic RNA synthesis generates a (+) strand RNA
as a template for (–) RNA segments. Progeny RNA
segments are then packaged in newly made nucleocapsid
protein and exported to the cytoplasm, for coating with
matrix, host cell membrane, and viral envelope proteins.
Neuraminidase cleaves the sialic acid connection to
host glycoproteins. This key step of virion release can be
blocked by Tamiflu.

Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV): Retrovirus

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus
(Baltimore group VI). As discussed in Chapter 6, a retrovirus requires the enzyme reverse transcriptase to copy its
RNA genome into DNA. Retroviruses are a large family of
viruses known to infect all types of vertebrate and invertebrate animals; for examples, see Table 11.1. The “simple retroviruses” have genomes of just four genes, such as
feline leukemia virus (FeLV), the number one killer of outdoor cats in the United States. Simple retroviruses generally cause cancer. The lentiviruses, or “slow viruses,” cause
diseases that progress slowly over many years. Lentiviruses
possess additional regulator genes that modulate host interactions. In addition, most animal genomes show evidence
of endogenous retroviruses, sequences from an ancient

retrovirus whose genome integrated and became “fixed”
by mutation, such as HERV-K (discussed in the Current
Research Highlight). Surprisingly, endogenous retroviruses evolve into essential parts of host genomes (see Section 11.4).
The most famous lentivirus is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The virus HIV and its causative
role in AIDS were discovered by French virologist Luc
Montagnier, building on Robert Gallo’s studies of retroviruses. In 2013, according to the United Nations, 35 million people globally were living with HIV, and AIDS
claimed 1.5 million lives. Yet three decades of research have
yielded drugs that can prevent AIDS and eliminate HIV
from populations. And the virus is engineered to make
“lentivectors,” our most successful agents of gene therapy
(see Section 11.4).

History of HIV and AIDS

HIV is a lentivirus that evolved from viruses infecting African monkeys. Two major types are recognized: HIV-1, the
cause of most infections at present; and HIV-2, another
type that appears to have evolved independently from a different strain infecting monkeys. The virus is transmitted
through blood and through genital or oral-genital contact.
HIV can hide in the host cell for many years, with only
gradual buildup of virus particles, most of which are eliminated by the host. Eventually, however, the virus destroys
the body’s T lymphocytes, leaving the host defenseless
against many organisms that normally would be harmless.

The first U.S. cases of AIDS were reported in 1981. A
historical view of AIDS in the United States emerges in the
book And the Band Played On by Randy Shilts, adapted as
an award-winning film in 1993. The book and film show
how American society failed for many years to grasp the significance of AIDS because the syndrome first appeared in
societal groups considered marginal (homosexual men and
certain ethnic immigrants), although it spread to all social
classes. In addition, the virus proved extremely difficult to
detect and grow in culture. The discovery of HIV sparked
controversy because Gallo failed to acknowledge his use of
a virus-producing cell line from Montagnier, the first to
isolate HIV-1. Since that time, the two scientists and many
others have collaborated to develop a test for HIV-1 infection and to search for a vaccine (Fig. 11.20A). In 2008,
the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded
to Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi (Fig. 11.20B)
for their discovery of HIV and its role in AIDS.
Thirty years later, HIV infects one in every 100 adults
worldwide, equally among women and men. In developed
countries, treatment effectively prolongs the life of people
with AIDS. Treatment involves mixtures of antiretroviral
drugs—all based on the molecular mechanisms of HIV
infection, described in this chapter. HIV treatment with
multiple drugs is called “highly active antiretroviral therapy,” or HAART. A surprising benefit of HAART was
discovered through humanitarian treatment programs in
Africa, such as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR), initiated in 2003 by President George
W. Bush and continued under President Barack Obama.
The PEPFAR program showed that, in communities that

deliver HAART to all members, regardless of infection
status, the virus production decreases so much that transmission declines—and HIV can be eliminated from the
population. Thus, testing and treating an entire population could actually wipe out AIDS.
In the United States, since 2012 the CDC has recommended routine HIV testing for all people 13 years of age
and older. Individuals at risk for HIV can take one daily
pill to greatly decrease their chance of infection. But still,
infected individuals must take expensive drugs with side
effects, and the HIV eventually acquires resistance.
We need a vaccine, but decades of research have failed.
Why? The answers to this question are complex.
■

■

High mutation rate. The mutation rate of HIV is
among the highest known for any virus. Within one
patient, the virus evolves into a quasispecies whose different strains attack different organs and predominate at
different stages of the disease.
Complex regulation of replication. The lentiviruses
express a greater number of regulator proteins than do the

“simple” retroviruses. These complex regulatory options
of a lentivirus enable HIV to hide itself within host cells.

HIV Structure and Genome

The structure of HIV as visualized by TEM consists of an
electron-dense core particle (or capsid) surrounded by a
phospholipid envelope (Fig. 11.20C). The conical core is
composed of capsid (CA) subunits whose arrangement is
partly icosahedral (Fig. 11.20D). The membrane around
the core contains spike proteins, which join the membrane
to the matrix, as in influenza virus. The envelope forms
around the core from host cell membrane, when a progeny
virion is budding out. In HIV, budding out does not rapidly lyse the cell but has other devastating consequences for
cell function (discussed shortly).
HIV core. The core contains two distinct single-stranded

copies of the RNA genome (Fig. 11.21A). Unlike influenza segments, each of the two RNAs contains a complete “map” of HIV genes. However, the two RNAs can

have slightly different alleles arising from distinct replication events. Thus, the HIV virion is genetically “diploid.”
A nonfunctional mutant gene on one genome may be complemented by a functional allele on the other.
Each RNA genome is coated with nucleocapsid (NC)
proteins similar in function to the NP proteins of influenza virus. Unlike influenza virus, each RNA of HIV
requires a primer for DNA synthesis: a tRNA derived from
the previously infected host cell. The host-derived tRNA is
packaged in place on the RNA template, ready to go. The
primed and packaged RNA is contained within the core
composed of CA subunits. The core also contains about
50 copies of reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR),
as well as a DNA integration factor (IN). Unique to type

HIV-1, subunits of a host chaperone named cyclophilin A
are incorporated into the structure—about one for every
ten core subunits. An HIV-1 mutant that fails to incorporate cyclophilin A can attach to a host cell and insert its capsid, but the core fails to come apart, and infection is halted.
The core is surrounded by a matrix (MA subunits),
which reinforces the host-derived phospholipid membrane. The membrane is pegged to the matrix by spike
proteins composed of the envelope subunits TM and SU
(Fig. 11.21B). As in influenza virus, the spike proteins
play crucial roles in host attachment and entry.

UC San Diego (Fig. 11.21C). Born in China in 1947,
Wong-Staal immigrated to the United States and then
worked with Gallo on the early discoveries of HIV. WongStaal now pursues gene therapy approaches to combat HIV
infection and is developing retroviral vectors for human
gene therapy (discussed in Section 11.4).
The HIV genome includes three main open reading frames
that are found in all retroviruses: gag, pol, and env. The gag
sequence encodes capsid, nucleocapsid, and matrix proteins;
pol encodes reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase, and protease; and env encodes envelope proteins. The gag and pol
sequences overlap, but because they are translated in different
reading frames (different ways to align the triplet code), the
ribosome expresses each independently of the other. During
infection, each reading frame is transcribed and translated as
a polyprotein; then, at subsequent stages, each polyprotein is
cleaved by proteases to form the mature products.
In HIV-1, the gag and pol sequences overlap, and env
overlaps with genes encoding accessory proteins, proteins that modify and regulate retroviral infection. Accessory proteins are unique to lentiviruses, mediating host
response and maintaining the long-term slow progression
of lentiviral disease. The accessory proteins are expressed
within the infected host cell and regulate the replication
cycle (Table 11.2). For example, Tat protein activates transcription of the viral genome. The HIV-1 genome encodes

at least six accessory proteins—a greater number than in
any other retrovirus. They are major targets for research
and drug discovery aimed at preventing HIV proliferation.
Origin and evolution of HIV. Where did HIV come from?

The origin of HIV has been traced back to the early twentieth century, based on genome sequence comparison
with related viruses infecting other primates, called simian
immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) (Fig. 11.22A). Sequence
comparison of different strains of HIV and SIV reveals that
an immunodeficiency virus actually entered the human
population more than once, from SIV strains derived from
related primates in Africa. It is thought that human consumption of primates for meat may have introduced SIV
strains that then adapted to human infection. Today, the
vast majority of HIV-infected patients show the HIV-1
strain M; but some people have been infected by HIV-2,
which derived independently from another SIV strain.
HIV is the most rapidly evolving pathogen known;
its replication generates about one mutation per progeny
virion. For this reason, physicians always prescribe a combination of antiretroviral drugs, with different molecular
targets. The hope is that if any one mutation confers resistance to one drug, the mutant virus will still be blocked by
another. This strategy of drug combination and continual
testing for resistance enables many treated HIV carriers to

remain free of AIDS for decades. But in some cases, recombination of different mutants can generate strains resistant
to multiple antiviral agents (Fig. 11.22B).
Within a single infected patient, the high mutation rates
generate multiple virus strains with differing properties of
replication, tissue tropism, and resistance to antibiotics.
This dynamic population of diverse mutant strains is called
a quasispecies (Fig. 11.23). The quasispecies forms when
an infective virion commences replication with rapid mutation and trait diversification. Many of the progeny virions
have sequences and tropisms so different from their ancestor that, in isolation, they would be classified as different
species. Different clonal variants of the virus colonize different tissues and organs. Virus types within a quasispecies may interact cooperatively on a functional level, by

serving complementary roles in the disease state, and thus
collectively define the traits of the viral population. But what
happens when an infected “donor” introduces HIV to a
recipient? Within the recipient, only one HIV type proliferates—close to the original type that generated the quasispecies. After this acute infection, the HIV population again
diversifies into the quasispecies. It’s as if a relatively narrow
range of genotype carries the HIV “germ line,” whereas
the mutant types sustain the infected state and maintain
immunosuppression.

HIV Attachment and Host Cell Entry

Like other viruses, HIV needs to recognize specific receptor molecules on the surface of its target cells. The primary

GENES AND GENOMES

receptor for HIV is the CD4 surface protein on CD4 T lymphocytes (T cells). The normal function of CD4 surface
proteins is to connect the T cell with an antigen-presenting
cell, which activates the T cell to turn on B-cell production
of antibodies (discussed in Section 24.2). Disruption of this
antibody production is the main cause of the AIDS-related
susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Note, however,
that CD4 proteins appear on many other cell types, such as
microglia (macrophage-like cells in the central nervous system) and Langerhans cells (immune cells of the epidermis).
Their presence may make other cells susceptible to infection
by HIV.
Spike proteins mediate membrane fusion. The binding
of HIV to CD4 receptors involves the envelope spike protein SU (Fig. 11.24). Spike proteins are the main external
proteins accessible to the host immune system.
HIV attachment to the cell membrane requires a fusion
peptide rearrangement similar to that of influenza virus,
except that it takes place at the cell surface (Fig. 11.24).
When SU (gp120) binds to CD4, the spike transmembrane
component TM (gp41) unfolds and extends its fusion peptide into the host cell membrane. In addition, SU binds
to secondary receptors in the membrane called chemokine
receptors (CCRs), such as the macrophage receptor CCR5.
Chemokines are signaling molecules for the immune system, but their receptor proteins can bind viruses that evolve
to take advantage of them. After the spike protein SU binds

receptors and the TM fusion peptide inserts, the HIV-1
envelope fuses with the plasma membrane. A CCR such
as CCR5 is also called a coreceptor, a protein acting with
CD4 to bind the HIV spike proteins.
The requirement for CCR attachment varies among different types of HIV. Some chemokine receptors are found
on neurons, and their involvement in HIV infection may
mediate the neurological disorders seen in AIDS. Furthermore, the predominance of different viral envelope types
with different receptor preferences varies over the course
of infection. As HIV evolves a quasispecies, the virions target the CCR5 receptor early in infection, whereas laterevolved virions target a different host surface protein,
called CXCR4. These “X4” virions can infect early-stage
T cells that do not yet carry CCR5; thus the AIDS disease
accelerates. The X4 virions are less infective when transmitted; thus, most new infections start with a CCR5 strain.
An exciting discovery was that individuals who lack
the CCR5 protein because of a genetic defect show a
high degree of resistance to HIV infection. This finding prompted the Pfizer company to develop an antiviral
blocker of CCR5, maraviroc (see Fig. 11.24), which was
approved for therapy in 2007 (see eTopic 11.5).
After HIV binds to membrane receptors, how does its
genome enter the cell? The HIV envelope fuses with the
cell membrane, enabling the HIV core to enter the cytoplasm directly. This HIV entry mechanism differs from

that of influenza virus, in which endocytosis and lysosome fusion are required to open the capsid and release the
genome into the cell. The HIV core (composed of CA and
the host-derived cyclophilin A) dissolves, releasing the two
RNA genomes, along with associated viral enzymes, into
the cytoplasm.

Thought Question

11.7 How do attachment and entry of HIV resemble attachment and entry of influenza virus? How do attachment and
entry differ between these two viruses?

The two RNA genomes each possess a 5′ “cap” and a
3′ poly-A “tail” that enable them to mimic host nuclear
mRNA. Each RNA is hybridized to a tRNA primer for
DNA synthesis. The primer is a lysine-specific tRNA from
the previous infected cell. The primer might be expected
to hybridize at the 3′ end of the template, where its 3′ OH
“points” toward the opposite end, positioned to synthesize
all the way down. Surprisingly, however, the 3′ OH end of
the tRNA actually binds near the 5′ end, where initially it
can generate only a brief sequence. These early sequences
bind key regulatory factors for transcription and for DNA
insertion into the host genome (discussed next).

Reverse Transcriptase
Copies RNA to DNA

A retrovirus, unlike other RNA viruses, must integrate its
entire genome into the host genome in order to replicate
viral genomes and produce new progeny virions. Thus,
the RNA genome needs to serve as a template to synthesize a DNA complement; but then the original RNA template must be degraded and replaced by a DNA strand, for
host integration. All these processes are accomplished by
reverse transcriptase (RT), the defining enzyme of a retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase is the source of the high error
rate of retroviral replication—on average, one or two errors
per copy of HIV. This high error rate generates the quasispecies of different strains within an HIV-infected person.
Reverse transcriptase is the target of the first clinically
useful drug to treat HIV infection, the nucleotide analog azidothymidine (AZT). AZT is incorporated into the
growing DNA chain in place of a thymidine, but because
its 3′ OH is replaced by an azido group (–N3), no further
nucleotides can be added.
The reverse transcriptase complex actually possesses
three different activities:
■

DNA synthesis from the RNA template. Synthesis
of DNA is first primed by the host tRNA, which was
hybridized to the chromosome within the virion.

■

VIRAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY

■

425

■

RNA degradation. After DNA synthesis, the template
RNA is gradually removed through an RNase H activity
of the RT complex. Removal of RNA enables replacement of the entire original RNA template by DNA.

■

DNA-dependent DNA synthesis. To make the DNA
complementary strand replacing the RNA, the RT needs
to use the newly made DNA as its template. Thus, RT
has the rare ability to use either DNA or RNA as a
template.

As shown in Figure 11.25A, the RNA template with
its short RNA primer is threaded through the RT complex between the “thumb” and “fingers”—a configuration
typical of other RNA polymerases (discussed in Chapter 8).
The RT complex adds successive deoxynucleotides from
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) starting at the
3′ OH end of the RNA primer. As DNA elongates, however, the RNA template is cleaved from behind by the RT
complex. Thus, the new DNA actually replaces preexisting
RNA sequence. This “destructive replication” is unique
to retroviruses. The details are important, as they suggest
possible targets for new antiviral drugs.
Reverse transcription. Reverse transcription of the HIV

genome involves unexpected complications (Fig. 11.25B).
First, the host-derived tRNA primer initiates synthesis (by
reverse transcriptase, RT) of a DNA strand complementary
to the RNA chromosome. DNA is elongated toward the 5′
end of the HIV chromosome, generating a short segment
(Fig. 11.25B, step 1). The original RNA template for this
short segment is then degraded by the RNase H activity of
RT, leaving only the DNA extension of the tRNA primer
(step 2).
The new DNA primes the second template. The original RNA template had repeated ends (labeled “r,” lowercase,
for RNA in Fig. 11.25B), and the exposed DNA copy of
the 5′ end has a complementary sequence (“R,” uppercase,
for DNA). The “R” DNA from the second tRNA extension
hybridizes to the 3′ end of the original RNA (Fig. 11.25B,
step 3). The hybridized DNA elongates along the rest of the
chromosome (step 4), up to the primer-binding site (pbs) for
mRNA transcription. DNA completion is followed by degradation of the remaining RNA template, except for occasional
short fragments to serve as primers, such as the polypurine
tract (ppt). A complementary DNA strand is then synthesized through the PPT primer, leaving a nick at U3 (step 5).
Interestingly, human host cells have evolved a protein,
APOBEC3G, that deaminates viral cytosines and thus
increases the error rate of reverse transcriptase. APOBEC3G
can be packaged into progeny virions, decreasing production of infective virions in the next host. However, HIV has
evolved an accessory protein, Vif (see Table 11.2), that binds
APOBEC3G to prevent it from being packaged into virions.

Integration into the host genome. The fi nal step of

genome processing requires integration into host DNA.
The double-stranded DNA copy of the HIV genome (plus
a short repeat of the 5′ end) circularizes (Fig. 11.25B,
step 6). The circular molecule then integrates into the host
chromosome by site-specific recombination at a host target sequence (step 7), mediated by the HIV integrase protein (IN). This step forms an integrated viral genome, or
provirus. Integration generates two copies of the provirus
5′ end (sequence U3-R-U5), which is called a long terminal repeat (LTR). The provirus and LTR ends are also
flanked by two copies of the host target sequence. Proviral
sequences can now be expressed, directing production of
progeny virions.
An alternative to virion production is that the integrated
HIV genome lies dormant, like the lambda prophage in
E. coli. The integrated HIV genome is replicated passively
within the genome of its host cell, hiding for many years
with only infrequent production of virions. The few virions
shed by the patient, however, can infect an unsuspecting
individual who has sexual contact with or is exposed to the
blood of the patient.

Replication Cycle of HIV

The steps of HIV replication are outlined in Figure 11.26 . The main points of viral entry and replication are typical of retroviruses. HIV, however, has
an exceptionally large number of accessory proteins that
govern the level of viral production and the duration of
the quiescent phase, when the integrated chromosome
replicates with the host cell.
Synthesis of HIV mRNA and progeny genomic RNA. After

the HIV virion attaches to the host receptors, its envelope
fuses with the host membrane (Fig. 11.26, step 1). Unlike
influenza virus, the HIV core enters the cytoplasm directly,
without endocytosis (step 2). The core partly uncoats, while
the RNA chromosomes within are reverse-transcribed to
make double-stranded DNA (step 3). The double-stranded
DNA enters the nucleus through a nuclear pore (step 4)—a
key step facilitated by Vpr accessory protein. Vpr enables
infection of nondividing cells, which only lentiviruses can
do; other retroviruses, such as those causing lymphoma,
must infect dividing cells, in which the nuclear membrane
dissolves during mitosis.
Upon entering the nucleus, the DNA copy of the HIV
genome integrates its sequence as a provirus at a random
position in a host chromosome (step 5). Integration is catalyzed by integrase (the IN protein; see Fig. 11.21). Integrase inhibitors such as raltegravir are an important class
of anti-HIV drugs. Within the nucleus, full-length RNA
transcripts are made by host RNA polymerase II, including

a 5′ cap and a 3′ poly-A tail (step 6). Some of the RNAs exit
the nucleus (step 7) to serve as mRNA for translation of
polyproteins. Polyproteins are translated in alternative versions, such as Gag-Pol. Other full-length RNA transcripts
exit the nucleus to form RNA dimers for progeny virions
(step 8). Still other RNA transcripts within the nucleus
are cut and spliced to complete the env gene sequence for
translation of Env (envelope) proteins (step 9).
The Env proteins are made within the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) (Fig. 11.26, step 10). They pass through
the Golgi for glycosylation and packaging (step 11) and are
exported to the cell membrane (step 12). At the membrane,
Env proteins plug into the core particle as it forms from the
RNA dimers plus Gag-Pol peptides (step 13).
Virion assembly and exit. The core particles are packaged
with envelope derived from host cell membrane containing Env spike proteins (Fig. 11.26, step 14). To escape the
host cell, emerging virions require accessory protein Vpu to
bind a “tetherin,” a host adhesion protein induced by interferon to cause reuptake and digestion of virions. Vpu causes
proteosomal degradation of the tetherin. Emerging virions,
some still tethered to the cell, are seen in Figure 11.27A.
As the virion buds off, the protease (PR) cleaves the GagPol peptide to complete maturation of the core structure
containing Gag subunits as well as reverse transcriptase
(RT) (Fig. 11.26, step 15). The Gag subunits now form
the conical core structure. Proteases that cleave Gag-Pol
offer important drug targets, which have led to the development of anti-HIV drugs known as protease inhibitors.
However, HIV has alternative means of cell-to-cell
transmission that avoid exposing virions to the immune
system. One alternative is cell fusion, mediated by binding
of Env in the membrane to CD4 receptors on a neighboring cell (see Fig. 11.26). The two cells then fuse, and HIV
core particles can enter the new cell through their fused
cytoplasm. The fusion of many cells can form a giant multinucleate cell called a syncytium. Cell fusion with formation
of syncytia enables HIV to infect neighboring cells without
ever exiting a cell. Another means of cell-to-cell transmission is to travel through a “nanotube” connection between
two T cells (Fig. 11.27B).
The intricate scheme in Figure 11.26 actually omits
many functions of HIV accessory proteins that enhance
the virulence of HIV infection (see Table 11.2). Mutation
of genes for accessory proteins often decreases virulence;
thus, these proteins are potential targets for chemotherapy.
Surprisingly, even a modest decrease of HIV infectivity can
have major benefits for the patient, suggesting that HIV is
so crippled by its high mutation rate that the slightest interference greatly decreases production of infective virions.
Thus, numerous effective antiviral agents are now known—
but all have side effects, and all select for resistant strains.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes an
ongoing pandemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Molecular biology has led to drugs that
control the infection.
HIV is a retrovirus whose RNA genome is reversetranscribed into double-stranded DNA, which integrates
into the DNA of the host cell.
The HIV core contains two different copies of its RNA
genome, each bound to a primer (host tRNA) and
reverse transcriptase (RT). The core is surrounded by an
envelope containing spike protein trimers.
HIV binds the CD4 receptor of T lymphocytes
together with the chemokine receptor CCR5. Following
virion-receptor binding and envelope-membrane fusion,
HIV core particle is released into the cytoplasm, where
it partly uncoats.
Reverse transcriptase synthesizes DNA from the
HIV RNA template, primed by the tRNA. RNA degradation allows formation of a double-stranded DNA.
Entering the nucleus, the retroviral DNA integrates
into the host genome.
Retroviral mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for
translation. Envelope proteins are translated at the ER
and exported to the cell membrane.
Retroviruses are assembled at the cell membrane,
where virions are released slowly, without lysis. Alternative

Endogenous Retroviruses
and Gene Therapy

Suppose an integrated HIV genome mutated and lost
the ability to produce progeny. What would happen to
its genome? The integrated genome would be “trapped”
within a cell, an endogenous retrovirus. If the cell entered
the host germ line, over many host generations in its host
the retroviral sequence would inevitably accumulate more
mutations. It could even provide the material for evolution
of a new trait. Such endogenous retroviruses inspired the
idea that researchers could intentionally manipulate a retrovirus to impart a useful trait and use it for gene therapy.

Retroelements in the Human Genome

The human genome is riddled with remains of retroviral
genomes, in various states of decay. These decaying genomes
are collectively known as retroelements (Fig. 11.28). Endogenous retroviruses (in humans, HERVs) are retroelements
that retain all the genomic elements of a retrovirus, including
gag, env, and pol genes. An example is HERV-K, an endogenous retrovirus that activates during normal development of
human embryos (see Current Research Highlight).

GENES AND GENOMES

Other elements, known as retrotransposons, retain
only partial retroviral elements but may maintain a reverse
transcriptase to copy themselves into other genomic locations. An example of a retrotransposon is the well-known
Alu sequence, a short sequence found in about a million
copies in the human genome. In some cases, a retrotransposon such as Alu can interrupt a key human gene, leading
to a genetic defect such as a defective lipoprotein receptor
associated with abnormally high cholesterol level and heart
failure. Still other retroelements, known as LINEs (long
interspersed nuclear elements) and SINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements), show more vestigial remnants of
retroviral genomes. Amazingly, retroelements and transposons appear to have generated about half the sequence of
the human genome.
Many HERVs and other mammalian ERVs are now
known to express viral components, such as reverse transcriptase, as part of normal host function. An example
in mice is an ERV participating in the B-cell immune
response to carbohydrate antigens (Fig. 11.29). In
mice, normal function of the B-cell response involves
B-cell antigen receptors, antibody-like molecules that
reside in the plasma membrane (discussed in Chapter 24). Like antibodies, B-cell receptors specifically recognize certain types of foreign molecules—in this case,
carbohydrates that might come from a pathogen. The
B-cell receptor signal requires a cascade of intracellular

signals culminating in B-cell proliferation and antibody
production. Part of the cascade requires induction of an
ERV to express retroviral R NA and reverse transcriptase. Both the R NA and the reverse-transcribed DNA
activate genes for antibody production. The requirement is demonstrated by treating mice with inhibitors
of reverse transcriptase, which consequently inhibit antibody production.

Gene Therapy with Lentivectors

The exceptional ability of lentiviruses to deliver their own
DNA to human cells makes them our most effective gene
transfer vectors. A gene transfer vector is a DNA sequence
that can express a recombinant gene within an animal or
plant cell, either from a plasmid or from a sequence integrated into the host genome. Vectors derived from HIV
are particularly useful for their ability to transfer genes into
nonmitotic cells.
The viruses used as gene transfer vectors are those
whose replication cycles establish a viral genome within
the host nucleus. Some of the first viral vectors were
made from double-stranded DNA viruses such as adenoviruses, which cause mild respiratory illness. An adenoviral genome enters the cell nucleus, where it circularizes
and replicates separately from the host chromosomes, in
a cycle similar to that of herpes viruses. Thus, adenoviral
vectors avoid the long-term risks
of inserting DNA permanently

coated with a VSV envelope protein

contains a human transgene that becomes integrated into
the host genome.
Could lentiviral integration be dangerous for the patient?
Lentiviral integration into host DNA poses the danger of
activating an adjacent proto-oncogene—that is, a human
gene that causes cancer when expressed at the wrong time.
To avoid this problem, lentivectors are modified so that
their promoters can activate only the gene of choice, not an
adjacent cancer gene. Furthermore, lentiviral vectors offer a
way to integrate DNA into nondividing cells of differentiated tissues such as brain neurons. For example, in 2009 a
lentivector derived from HIV halted progression of a fatal
brain disease, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), in two young
boys. The lentivector inserted a gene replacing a defective
gene in each boy’s blood stem cells.
In a different case, in 2012, the first leukemia patients
were successfully treated by lentiviral gene therapy. The
HIV-derived vector reprogrammed the patients’ own T
cells to attack cancerous B cells. A 7-year-old girl, Emily
Whitehead (Fig. 11.30 inset), was the first child to be considered fully “cured” of disease by a lentiviral vector.

How a Lentivector Works

To construct a safe and effective vector, the HIV genome
is modified extensively. In the example shown in Figure 11.31 , accessory genes vpr, vpu, nef, and vif, which
encode HIV virulence factors for disease, were removed.
Other protein-encoding genes necessary for virion production were put into DNA helper plasmids, to be provided
only in tissue culture for vector production. These genes
provide the capsid monomer (gag), reverse transcriptase
(pol), envelope glycoprotein (env), and a regulator of mRNA
export from the nucleus (rev). The HIV env gene is replaced
by an env gene from another virus, vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV). The VSV envelope protein has a broad tropism (host
range) and thus enables the lentivector to infect a broad
range of host cell types. Each helper plasmid drives its gene
expression from a well-studied promoter of another virus,
such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV). The original HIV vector genome retains only
the LTR end sequences (R-U5) required for genome integration, a packaging signal from the start of gag, and the
infectivity-enhancing polypurine tract (PPT).

plasmids. Their expression is driven by regulatory elements from other viruses (red). Source: Modified from Blesch. 2003. Methods 33:164.

To express the transgene (the gene of interest for
expression in the host), a CMV promoter was inserted in
the HIV-derived RNA vector. To further enhance transgene expression, a genetic enhancer sequence was added
from woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). Note that a “lentiviral” gene transfer system, in fact, includes genetic elements from a diverse set of human and animal viruses, all
found in previous studies to contribute specific properties
to infection. Although these genes originate from different
viruses, they nevertheless function together like parts of a
machine.
To produce infective virions, the HIV-derived RNA
vector plus the three helper plasmids are introduced into
a special tissue culture line. The vector and plasmids enter
the cells by a process, called transfection, in which calcium phosphate treatment promotes the uptake of nucleic
acids across the cell membrane. The host tissue culture cells
are derived from human embryonic kidney 293T cells containing a gene for a protein from simian virus 40 (SV40)
that enables the replication of DNA plasmids containing an
SV40 replication site. The 293T cells allow efficient expression of the viral genes on the helper plasmids, as well as
a full virion production cycle in which the vector RNA is
replicated and packaged into virions.

Safety of Lentivectors

The use of disease-causing viruses for human therapy raises
important concerns about safety. The viruses might express
toxins, induce cancer, or trigger a damaging immune
response. These concerns need to be weighed against the
risks of the conditions they are used to treat, such as severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID), cystic fibrosis, and
cancer. In general, gene therapy is approved only for conditions that are life-threatening and for which alternative
therapies are inadequate.
Viruses used for gene therapy are engineered extensively
to decrease risks, using techniques of genetic engineering
presented in Chapter 12. Safety features of viral vectors
include:
■

Deleting virulence genes. Viral genes that promote
disease and virion proliferation, but are not required
for establishment of the viral DNA in the nucleus, are
deleted from the vector genome. To produce the vector
in tissue culture, the viral proliferation genes are provided on helper plasmids.

■

Avoiding genome insertion next to oncogenes.
Vectors engineered from adenoviruses are usually designed to avoid host chromosome integration

CHAPTER 11

altogether. The disadvantage of avoiding integration is
that the separate viral DNA is soon lost from host tissues, and the therapy requires frequent repetition. In
lentivectors, molecular modification avoids activation
of proto-oncogenes.
■

■

Altering tissue specificity. The tropism, or tissue
specificity, can be altered by replacing the gene for
the viral envelope glycoprotein (spike protein) with
the envelope gene from a different virus. For example,
a rabies virus glycoprotein can be used to target the
vector to brain cells. The alteration of viral tissue
specificity by envelope gene replacement is called
“pseudotyping.” Pseudotyping can be used either to
narrow the host range or to broaden it, depending on
the needs of the vector.
Avoiding germ-line infection. Current medical standards prohibit alteration of the germ line, the egg and
sperm cells that transmit genes to the next generation. Because the long-term risks of gene therapy are
unknown, only somatic gene therapy (gene insertion
into somatic, or body, cells) is permitted.

RNA viruses and encode a wider range of viral enzymes;
for example, the vaccinia genome encodes nearly 200 different proteins. The complexity of viruses such as vaccinia
and herpes approaches that of small cells.
Herpes viruses have been associated with humans and
our ape ancestors for hundreds of millions of years (see
Chapter 6). Different herpes viruses cause diseases ranging from chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus) to birth defects
(cytomegalovirus). Today, in a remarkable twist, we have
engineered a “tumor-eating herpes” to treat metastatic
tumors (discussed shortly).
Herpes viral DNA replicates by mechanisms similar to those
used in the replication of prokaryotic and phage genomes,
either bidirectionally from an origin of replication (as in bacteria) or by the rolling-circle method (as in phages such as T4).
Like cellular genomes, herpes viral DNA replication requires
more than a polymerase; enzymes such as helicase, primase,
and single-strand binding proteins are also needed.

Herpes Simplex Virus Infects
the Oral or Genital Mucosa

An important example of a DNA virus is herpes simplex
virus (HSV). Strains HSV-1 and HSV-2 cause one of the
most common infections in the United States. Approximately 60% of Americans acquire herpes simplex, usually
HSV-1, in epithelial lesions commonly known as cold sores.
About 30%–60% acquire genital herpes, usually HSV-2,
through sexual contact (oral or vaginal). Genital herpes

causes recurrent eruptions of infection in the reproductive
tract (Fig. 11.32). Many of those infected are unaware of
symptoms, but they can still transmit the disease to others.
Herpes simplex virus typically infects cells of the oral
or genital mucosa, causing ulcerated sores. The primary
infection is epithelial, followed by latent infection within
neurons of the ganglia. A common site of infection is
the trigeminal ganglion, which processes nerve impulses
between the face and eyes and the brain stem.
The latent infection of the ganglia later leads to new
outbreaks of virus, often triggered by stress such as menstruation, sunlight exposure, or depression of the immune
system. Progeny virions travel back down the dendrites to
the epithelia, causing lytic infection. In the trigeminal ganglion, herpes reactivation can lead to eye disease or lethal
brain infection. In most cases, herpes symptoms can be
controlled by antiviral agents such as acyclovir (discussed
in Chapter 27). No cure or means of preventing future outbreaks exists. In pregnant women, HSV can be transmitted
to the fetus, with serious complications for the child.
Herpes simplex virus is closely related to varicella-zoster virus, the cause of chickenpox, also an epithelial infection. Varicella, too, can hide in ganglial neurons, emerging
decades later to cause painful skin lesions called shingles.

packaged within an icosahedral capsid. The capsid is surrounded by tegument, a collection of virus-encoded and host-derived proteins. The
tegument is contained within a host-derived membrane envelope, including several kinds of envelope proteins. B. The genome of HSV-1 spans
152,000 base pairs, encoding more than 70 gene products. The HSV sequence consists of two segments: long (UL) and short (US). Each segment contains a unique region (UL or US) flanked by two inverted-repeat regions—terminal (TRL or TRS) and internal (IRL or IRS)—where the
two segments meet.

(Fig. 11.33A ). The capsid is surrounded by tegument,
a collection of about 15 different kinds of virus-encoded
proteins, as well as proteins from the previous host. The
tegument is contained within a host-derived membrane
envelope with several kinds of spike proteins. The HSV-1
genome spans 152 kb, encoding more than 70 gene products (Fig. 11.33B). The sequence includes two unique
segments, long (U L) and short (US), each flanked by a terminal repeat (TR L or TR S) and an internal repeat (IR L
or IR S). Within the host, the genome circularizes, so the
genetic linkage map appears circular.
Herpes genes and gene regulatory elements resemble those of eukaryotic genes. Each gene has a promoter
with eukaryotic control sequences such as the TATA box.
Genes are transcribed and translated individually; there is
no polyprotein. Genes fall into temporal classes within the
viral replication cycle: immediate, early, and late expressed
genes. Each class has specific regulatory elements. Thus,
the virus expresses only the gene products needed for a
given phase of infection. An additional class, consisting of the LAT genes, is expressed for latent infection
(discussed next).

Herpes Simplex Attachment
and Host Cell Entry
Unlike HIV, the relatively large herpes virion has several
envelope proteins that can bind to several alternative receptor molecules on the host cell surface, such as a homolog
of tumor necrosis factor receptor called HveA or intercellular adhesion molecules called nectins (Fig. 11.34 , step
1). As in the case of HIV, the entire herpes capsid enters
the cytoplasm (step 2); but unlike HIV, whose core particle
partly uncoats, the intact herpes capsid travels down a scaffold of microtubules (step 3) to the nuclear membrane. During this stage, the virion host shutoff factor (Vhs) degrades
host mRNA, thus shutting off host protein synthesis. At
a nuclear pore complex, the herpes capsid injects its DNA
(step 4). The DNA is forced out of the capsid and into the
nucleus by the high pressure of double-stranded DNA packing in the capsid, similar to the high-pressure injection of
phage T4 DNA into a bacterial cell. The DNA then circularizes (step 5) to form a plasmid-like intermediate.
The herpes genome now takes one of two alternative directions: expression of mRNA for proteins of the infection cycle,

or expression of mRNA encoding LAT proteins to maintain latency (Fig. 11.34, step 6). If the latent course is taken,
the DNA circle can persist within the cell for decades before
switching to lytic infection. Latent infection is seen most
often in nerve cells, such as those of the trigeminal ganglion.

Replication of Herpes Simplex Virus

In the nucleus, herpes DNA is transcribed to mRNA by host
RNA polymerase II (see Fig. 11.34, step 5). If mRNA for
lytic infection is produced, it exits the nucleus to be translated by ribosomes. Many different mRNAs are produced
and exported, including those required for “immediate” and
“early” stages of infection (Fig. 11.34, step 7). The translated
proteins return to the nucleus for packaging within capsids.
To generate progeny genomes, the circular DNA is replicated by viral enzymes, including DNA polymerase, singlestrand binding protein, and a proofreading endonuclease
(Fig. 11.34, step 8). Additional enzymes are provided
by the host cell. DNA is replicated by the rolling-circle
method, generating a concatemer similar to that of phage
T4. Unlike T4, however, the herpes DNA is eventually cut
into segments defined by the terminal repeat sequences.
The newly synthesized DNA expresses late-stage mRNA
(Fig. 11.34, step 9), which exits the nucleus for translation.
Translated envelope proteins are inserted into the ER membrane, through which they migrate to the nuclear membrane
(step 10). Other late proteins reenter the nucleus for assembly into capsids containing DNA genomes (step 11). The
envelope forms from the outer nuclear membrane (step 12).
The virions are then transported through the ER, where
they undergo secondary envelopment (step 13). The secondary-enveloped virions move to the Golgi, and ultimately to
the cell membrane (step 14). The secondary envelope fuses
with the cell membrane, releasing mature virions through
exocytosis (step 14). Rapid release of virions destroys cells,
causing the characteristic sores of herpes infection.

with that of the HIV chromosome.

Persistent Viral Infections

Herpes viruses can infect humans and other animals indefinitely, following initiation of latency by the viral LAT proteins (see Fig. 11.34, step 6). Most humans are infected by
several latent herpes viruses, such as human herpes viruses
6 and 7, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (see Special Topic 11.1). We may be infected all our lives without
knowing it; in fact, our bodies may actually benefit from
the presence of these viruses. For example, in 2007, Herbert Virgin and colleagues at the Washington University

School of Medicine in St. Louis showed that mice infected
with a gamma herpes virus similar to Epstein-Barr virus
resist infection by the bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes (the cause of listeriosis) and Yersinia pestis (the
cause of bubonic plague). The mechanism of antibacterial
resistance may involve stimulation of the immune response.
Thus, some of our silent herpes viral “partners” may have
coevolved with humans in a mutually beneficial relationship, or mutualism (discussed in Chapter 21).
The maintenance of persistent or latent viral infection
involves several kinds of processes that are surprisingly similar in DNA viruses such as herpes and in retroviruses such
as HIV. These processes include:
■

Infection of cell types suitable for long-term persistence. After infecting skin cells for rapid viral replication, some HSV virions infect neurons. Neurons are
long-lived cells that provide the virus with an everlasting
home in the host. Similarly, Epstein-Barr virus persists
within long-lived memory-B-cell lymphocytes.

■

Regulation of viral gene expression. The LAT proteins suppress expression of viral genes for lytic replication, thus preventing host cell destruction where the
latent viral DNA resides. Suppression is the result of
assembly of “heterochromatin,” chromosome-associated
host proteins that inactivate all viral genes except those
encoding LAT proteins.

■

Viral subversion of cellular apoptosis. To maintain
latent infection, a viral DNA must prevent host cell apoptosis, a form of programmed self-destruction in response
to viral infection. For example, cytomegalovirus prevents
apoptosis by mimicking one host apoptosis protein and
inhibiting another. Similarly, the HIV retroviral accessory protein Tat prevents apoptosis by inhibiting protein
p53, which suppresses tumors through apoptosis.

■

Evasion of immune responses. Both herpes viruses
and retroviruses express proteins that inhibit signaling
molecules of the immune system, or that mimic immunosuppressive signals.

Herpes Viruses Engineered
to Kill Tumors

The long-standing adaptation of herpes viruses to the human
body confers properties useful for virotherapy. Some kinds
of viruses have a preference for infection of tumor cells. Such
a virus is called “oncolytic.” Oncolytic viruses are being
developed to treat cancer. An example of an oncolytic virus
for tumor therapy is the engineered form of HSV-1 virus
called T-VEC, developed by a company acquired by Amgen.
In 2015, the United States approved the use of T-VEC to
treat melanoma in patients with inoperable tumors.

include microcephaly, neurological problems, and loss of

We often think of herpes viruses as something to avoid
“catching,” like chickenpox or herpes simplex. But some members of this ancient and diverse virus family are hard to avoid.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects between 50% and 80% of us
before age 40. The virus is transmitted by person-to-person
contact, usually causing no symptoms. But CMV may start
to replicate in immunocompromised people—for example,
after an organ transplant. And during pregnancy, new CMV
exposure or reactivation of a latent infection can expose the

embryonic neural progenitor cells (NPCs, left) grow as clumps of round neurospheres. NPCs infected with virus (right) form long
projections and commence migration—a sign of premature differentiation.
■

T-VEC infects tumor cells and replicates, but it cannot
replicate within normal cells. When T-VEC infects tumor
cells, it also releases tumor cell fragments that attract cells
of the immune system to recognize the tumors for destruction. Because T-VEC activates the immune system, it helps
destroy tumors throughout the body. This antitumor effect
of a virus is particularly promising for metastatic tumors
that are hard to treat by other means.

■

■

■

To Summarize
■

■

Herpes simplex virus causes recurring eruptions of
sores in the oral or genital mucosa. Initial transmission
is by oral or genital contact, followed by eruptions from
reactivated virus latent in ganglial neurons.
The herpes virion contains a double-stranded DNA
genome, packed in an icosahedral capsid. The capsid is surrounded by numerous matrix proteins and by an envelope.

■

■

■

HSV attachment may involve several alternative receptors. A microtubular scaffold transports the herpes virions to the nucleus, where the DNA genome is inserted.
The DNA circularizes for transcription.
LAT protein expression leads to latent infection, usually in nerve cells, where the DNA persists silently for
months or years.
DNA genomes of HSV are synthesized by the rollingcircle method, using viral DNA polymerase supplemented by viral and host-generated components.
Infectious mRNA expression leads to production of
capsid, matrix, and envelope proteins for assembly of HSV.
HSV assembly takes place at the nuclear membrane or
other membranes. The virions are released from the cell
by exocytosis. Rapid release leads to mucosal pathology.
HSV can be engineered to specifically kill tumors.

CHAPTER 11

on human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), the cells that develop
into neurons. Neural progenitor cells were obtained from the
brain of a premature infant that died of natural causes. When
cultured in a dish, the neural cells grow as round cells in a clump,
remaining in position. The cells can be induced to differentiate
(become more advanced neural cells). But what happens when
the cells are infected by CMV? Fortunato found that infected
NPCs begin to differentiate prematurely, at the wrong stage
of development, thus causing a defect. In Figure 1B, the CMVinfected cells (right-hand photo) are differentiating, extending
their cytoplasm, and starting to move. Thus, Fortunato shows
how cytomegalovirus could alter the differentiation of embryonic cells during neonatal development.
To uncover the details of CMV infection, we need an
immortalized cell line in which the virus replicates its genome
indefinitely. Fortunato developed such a line, using T98G
glioblastoma cells (Fig. 2). Glioblastoma is a cancer of the
glia, accessory cells to neurons. The cancer cells have lost
their growth inhibition and replicate continually in tissue culture. Figure 2 shows infected cells with the nuclei stained
blue (Hoechst stain) and the CMV viral genomes stained
pink (FISH, fluorescent DNA probe). We hope that improved
understanding of this viral process can yield insights that will
help prevent future birth defects.

RESEARCH QUESTION
How could you use the glioblastoma cell line to determine which
viral proteins initiate or prevent the CMV replication cycle?

Concluding Thoughts
In considering the mechanisms of viral infection, a picture
emerges of interesting commonalities, as well as intriguing
diversity:
■

Viral infection requires host membrane receptors.
Different viruses evolve to take advantage of different
cell membrane proteins in order to recognize and gain
entry into host cells. Mutation of host receptors confers
resistance to the virus.

■

Viruses recruit host cells to replicate their genomes.
Viral genomes are remarkably diverse, including RNA or
DNA, single- or double-stranded, linear or circular. Within
the host cell, replication proceeds by a variety of methods,
with varying dependence on viral and host enzymes.

■

Virus particles (and their genomes) range in size
from a few components to assemblages approaching

the minimal requirement for resources. The advantage
of complexity is the fi ne-tuning of infection mechanisms
for evading host defenses.
The study of viral molecular biology raises intriguing questions about the nature of viral replication and
about viral origins (see eTopic 6.1). Research in virology
offers hope for new drugs and cures for humanity’s worst
plagues, as well as devastating diseases of agricultural
plants and animals. At the same time, it is sobering to note
that despite the enormous volumes we now know about
viruses such as HIV and influenza, the AIDS pandemic
continues to grow, and we face the likely emergence of a
new deadly flu strain. Molecular research can succeed only
in partnership with epidemiology and public health (discussed in Chapter 28).

We can now ask previously unanswerable questions about ribosome function. For example, we assumed that
the two ribosomal subunits had to

is inaccurate. We can also use Ribo-T
to create the first ever fully independent ribosome mRNA

Transposons Inactivate
and Mark Target Genes

How were E. coli acid survival genes found and their function discovered? An early step taken to gain insight into
E. coli acid resistance involved isolating mutants defective
in that process. The initial goal was to inactivate relevant
genes and tag them with an antibiotic resistance marker. To
do this, a transposon (see Section 9.5) containing a tetracycline resistance gene was randomly inserted into the chromosome by transposition. When a transposon inserts into a
target gene sequence, the target gene is inactivated and the
mutant cell becomes antibiotic resistant. In our example,
each tetracycline-resistant cell resulting from transposition
grew into a colony; the colony was picked with a sterile
toothpick and transferred into a well of a microtiter plate
containing growth medium (Fig. 12.2A).
After about 10,000 colonies were transferred to microtiter dishes and grown, a multipronged replicator device
(a square with 48 metal prongs arranged in six rows of eight)
was used to transfer small amounts of each culture to new

microtiter plate wells that contained a pH 2 medium. After
several hours of incubation, the multipronged replicator was
again used to sterilely transfer samples of the pH 2 culture
from each well to an agar plate. A few of the tetracyclineresistant mutants failed to grow on the agar, meaning they
had been killed by the pH 2 environment. The transposon in these acid-sensitive mutants had inserted into a gene
required for acid resistance, rendering it inactive. The acidsensitive mutants were retrieved from the original growth
medium microtiter plates and subjected to further analysis.

Thought Questions

12.1 How would you modify the technique illustrated in

Figure 12.2A to identify mutants defective in the synthesis
of an amino acid, such as glutamic acid? Hint: You can use a
minimal agar medium.

a strategy to construct a strain of E. coli that cannot synthesize histidine?

DNA Sequencing of Insertion
Sites and Computer Analysis

Once mutants in a project are identified, it is important to
know which genes the insertions occurred in. In our example, an oligonucleotide primer (a short, single-stranded
DNA molecule) that anneals to one end of the transposon
was used to sequence across the insertion joint and into the
adjacent E. coli DNA (Fig. 12.2B). The DNA sequences
obtained were subjected to computer-based homology
searches with the sequenced genome of E. coli. The resulting matches indicated that insertions had occurred in four
genes. Two of these genes encode isoforms of glutamate
decarboxylase (GadA and GadB) that differ by only a few
amino acids. A third gene produces a glutamate/GABA
antiporter (GadC), and a fourth gene encodes a putative
DNA-binding protein with no known function, although it
was annotated as a possible regulator.
The nature of the genes’ functions suggests how the
system might protect cells submerged in acid (Fig. 12.3).
When E. coli is placed in a pH 2 environment, the cytoplasmic pH falls to dangerously low levels. Glutamate decarboxylase removes a carboxyl group from glutamate and replaces

gene target of a transposon insertion. A primer that anneals to a

annealing temperature, bind random sequences around the chromosome (including downstream of the transposon) are used to amplify
the junction between the transposon and the gene into which it
has inserted. Subsequent sequencing of the product using only the
transposon primer identifies the gene and the insertion point.

sequence data identified the location of the transposon insertions leading to acid sensitivity. The genes identified included two
isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase and a putative antiporter that

of the cell. The combined action of the decarboxylase and antiporter
removes H+ from the cell.

it with a proton from the cytoplasm, thereby decreasing
acidity and elevating cytoplasmic pH. The decarboxylation product of the reaction is gamma-aminobutyric acid
(γ-aminobutyric acid), also known as GABA. But to continue draining protons from the cytoplasm, E. coli must
bring in more glutamate. The glutamate/GABA antiporter
does this by importing glutamate while expelling GABA.
Alternative strategies have also been used to identify
genes potentially related to acid resistance. Microarrays and
RNA deep sequencing techniques have been used to identify all cellular transcripts regulated by growth of E. coli
under milder acid environments. Bioinformatic strategies
outlined in Chapter 8 were then used to hypothesize function of the products (regulator, transporter, and so on).
Some of the acid pH-regulated genes were then selectively
deleted using in vivo molecular tools that precisely delete
the gene of interest, replacing it with an antibiotic drug
marker. Once these genes were deleted, researchers could
determine the effects of the missing gene on acid resistance
or on the expression of other acid-regulated genes.

Exploring Gene Regulation:
Transcriptomics versus
Reporter Fusions

Another important question in our research example was
whether acid resistance genes are regulated in response to
changes in the environment. Are they always expressed, making the cell ever-ready to encounter acid stress? Or does the
cell sense when it might encounter life-threatening low pH
and only then express acid resistance genes? Recall that the
cell can control production of a protein by regulating transcription and/or translation, or by altering mRNA or protein stability (processes described in Chapters 8 and 10). How
do microbiologists differentiate among these possibilities or
determine whether there is any regulation in the first place?
As will be described in Section 12.2, quantitative (realtime) PCR can be used to measure changes in the amount of
a specific RNA transcript when cells are subjected to environmental or genetic perturbations. RNA deep sequencing (RNAseq), described in Section 10.6, can measure the
levels of all transcripts in a cell. However, those techniques
have drawbacks if you want to continually monitor gene
expression in a live cell or if you want to screen for regulatory genes that control the expression of the target gene.
One technique that allows continuous monitoring of a
gene’s expression involves linking (or fusing) the promoter of
the gene of interest to what is called a promoter-less reporter
gene, such as lacZ (which encodes beta-galactosidase) or gfp
(GFP, green fluorescent protein; see Chapter 2). Reporter
genes encode proteins whose activities are easily assayed. In
the case of lacZ, beta-galactosidase (β-galactosidase) converts the substrate o-nitrophenyl galactoside (ONPG) to a

GENES AND GENOMES

Because there is only one promoter, only one mRNA transcript is made. The 5′ end of the newly engineered polycistronic mRNA will contain the target gene transcript
followed at the 3′ end by the reporter gene transcript. Now,
any factor that controls expression of the target gene’s promoter will also control production of the reporter. Because
the reporter retains its own ribosome-binding site, it will
not respond to translational controls over the target transcript. The fusion just described is known as a transcriptional fusion, which can monitor transcriptional control
of the target gene.
Another type of reporter lacks both its promoter and its
RBS. This reporter produces gene fusions (also known as
protein fusions or translational fusions). For the reporter
protein to be synthesized, the reporter gene sequence must
be joined to the target gene sequence in the proper codon
reading frame (Fig. 12.4C). Now, not only will the mRNA
transcripts of the target and reporter genes be fused, but
the peptides of the truncated target gene and the reporter
gene will also be linked. In this case, anything controlling
the transcription or translation of the target gene will also
control reporter protein levels.
Each type of fusion can be constructed in vitro using
plasmids and then transferred into recipient cells in a way
that promotes the exchange of the reporter fusion for the
resident gene. Once constructed, these fusions allow the
researcher to monitor how different growth conditions,
or whether suspected regulators, influence the transcription or translation of the gene. These fusions provide convenient phenotypes (for example, lactose fermentation or
fluorescence) that can be exploited in mutant hunts to
screen for new regulators. eAppendix 3 describes how lacZ
fusions can be used to find regulatory genes.

dips. Now imagine looking down at a neighborhood of
houses. You see that the heater in one house turns on as
another house’s heater turns off. The result appears to be a
stochastic (random) process of heaters being turned on and
off, but the population as a whole stays warm.
Do bacterial cells respond to stress in the same way? What
technique could even address this question in single cells?
LacZ fusions are inadequate because LacZ enzyme activity is
measured as an average of all cells in the population. However, green fluorescent protein (GFP), or a derivative such as
yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), fused to a gene does allow
scientists to view (in real time) what happens inside single
cells within a population. Realizing this, Michael Elowitz
and colleagues from the California Institute of Technology
used a YFP fusion to elegantly reveal stochastic gene expression in Bacillus subtilis subjected to energy stress.
Elowitz and co-workers placed the promoter and
ribosome-binding site of the gene encoding sigma B, a
major stress sigma factor from B. subtilis, in front of yfp.
Cells in which sigma B was expressed would fluoresce
green. A sigma B–YFP cell was then treated with mycophenolic acid to induce energy stress. What happened
next was observed using quantitative time-lapse microscopy. Surprisingly, the constant energy stress imposed on
the population triggered unsynchronized pulses of sigma
B activation in individual cells (Fig. 12.5). As the stress
increased, the pulses became more frequent. Thus, sigma B
controls its target genes through sustained on/off pulsing
(like the neighborhood house heaters) rather than by continuous activation.
As this example illustrates, GFP fusions are more versatile than LacZ fusions in many ways. GFP fusions can be

You find a 50-fold increase in expression of gadA (based on

is transcriptional or translational?

Targeted Gene Editing and Regulation
with CRISPR-Cas9 Technology

Chapter 9 described a form of bacterial and archaeal
“immune system” called CRISPR (clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats). Recall that when a
bacterial cell survives a viral attack, a short DNA sequence
from the virus is captured and inserted into the CRISPR
locus as a kind of memory of the attack (see Fig. 9.13).
The CRISPR locus includes sequences captured from
many viruses, forming a kind of rogues’ gallery of viral
suspects. The virus-derived sequences are separated from
each other by short (32 bp) palindromic repeat sequences.

Once captured, transcripts of the virus memory sequences
are periodically incorporated into a “search and destroy”
endonuclease called Cas (Fig. 9.13). If the same virus reinvades the cell at a later date, the CRISPR transcript (called
csRNA) guides Cas to the target viral DNA sequence and
cleaves it, thereby destroying the virus. This is how the system works in nature. One CRISPR-Cas system has now
been repurposed into a powerful molecular tool that can
genetically edit any gene in a eukaryotic cell. The technology has enabled precision gene editing in species where this
has never been possible.
The CRISPR-Cas9 editing tool. The system most often used
is the CRISPR-Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes. The key to
this tool is in programming a synthetic csRNA (now called
a guide RNA, or gRNA) to direct Cas9 endonuclease to a
specific eukaryotic gene. The programmed gRNA is fused to
what is called the tracer RNA, a molecule that binds to and
activates Cas9 (Fig. 12.6). How are these genes introduced
into eukaryotic cells? The gene that encodes Cas9 and the
gene for the programmed guide RNA are inserted into plasmids that are introduced into eukaryotic cells via transformation, and the genes are transiently expressed in the nucleus.
The guide RNA binds to the Cas9 endonuclease and helps it
recognize the target eukaryotic sequence. The endonuclease

then introduces a double-strand break in the target DNA—a
critical feature of this gene-editing tool. To survive, the
eukaryotic cell will try to re-join the blunt ends using nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair (Fig. 12.6A; described
in Section 9.4). However, the process often deletes a few
bases, which may cripple the gene. Once mutated, the effect
of the altered gene on cell physiology can be assessed.
The targeted gene can also be changed or replaced using
CRISPR-Cas9 technology. In this case, a third plasmid is
introduced that expresses a modified version (or allele) of
the gene. Both ends of the replacement gene are homologous to DNA flanking the target gene, so homologous
recombination systems will replace the broken gene with
the modified allele. Any type of insertion, deletion, or
change in sequence can be introduced.
A striking example of this technology’s potential was
demonstrated when it was used to disrupt latent HIV provirus in infected cells. As described in Chapter 11, HIV
DNA made by reverse transcriptase integrates into the host
genome. Current drug therapies can stop HIV replication
and transmission, but will not expunge the provirus from
infected cells. Scientists from Kyoto University led by Hirotaka Ebina used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to disrupt HIV
provirus, offering hope that this system may provide a tool
for curing HIV infection.

The CRISPR-Cas9 system has also been modified to serve
as a regulator of gene expression. CRISPR interference
(CRISPRi), for example, uses an inactive version of Cas9
(dCas9) that no longer works as an endonuclease but can
still be guided to target DNA sequences. Once bound to its
target, dCas9 blocks transcription. Timothy Lu’s laboratory
at MIT recently used CRISPRi to control gene expression
in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron growing in a mouse intestine. B. thetaiotaomicron is an important bacterial member
of mammalian gut microbiomes (discussed in Sections 13.4
and 23.1). The scientists designed an sgRNA (single guide
RNA) to target a luciferase gene that was part of the organism’s genome. The sgRNA and the gene for dCas9 were
also integrated into the microbe’s genome (Fig. 12.6B).
The gene for dCas9 also included the lacO operator, which
means that dCas9 can be induced by the addition of IPTG.
Without IPTG, the circuit allows luciferase to be made,
and cells glow. Adding IPTG, however, induces dCas9 production. The sgRNA guides dCas9 to the luciferase gene
to turn it off. The authors demonstrated that the system
worked when the programmed organism resided in the
mouse intestine and IPTG was added to drinking water.
The ability to precisely modulate gene expression in commensal organisms should enable functional studies of the
microbiome, noninvasive monitoring of in vivo environments, and long-term targeted therapeutics.

Transposons can be used to mutate genes and mark the
defective gene with antibiotic resistance.
The location of a transposon insertion can be determined by sequencing from the end of the transposon
across the insertion junction. The junction sequence
is examined by online comparative BLAST analysis to
identify the gene in the genome.
Annotations of the gene may provide clues about the
function of the protein.
Regulation of a gene can be determined by fusing that
gene to an easily assayed reporter gene.
Transcriptional fusions to reporter genes reflect transcriptional control of the subject gene.
Translational fusions to reporter genes (gene fusions)
reflect transcriptional and translational control of the
subject gene.
The CRISPR-Cas9 microbial “immune system” has
been adapted as a tool to quickly and efficiently edit
eukaryotic genes.

Molecular Techniques

In many cases, making gene fusions is not possible. For
instance, some fusion proteins can aggregate and block
membranes. In these situations, deep sequencing and mass
spectrometry techniques can be used for whole-cell transcriptomic and proteomic purposes, respectively (see Chapter 10).
But sometimes, examining only a specific gene or protein is
desired. Classic molecular techniques can then be used, such
as the northern blot (for RNA), the Southern blot (for DNA),
and the western blot (for protein). All rely on electrophoresis
to separate relevant macromolecules (see Section 3.2). Details
of the northern and Southern blot techniques are found in
eAppendix 3. Here we briefly review the techniques and
show how they helped reveal details of E. coli acid resistance.

Northern and Southern Blots

Northern blots are used to analyze the presence, size, and
processing of a specific RNA molecule in a cell extract. In the
northern blot technique, RNA is extracted from the cell, and
individual molecules are separated by size, using electrophoresis through an agarose-formaldehyde gel (see eAppendix 3).
The separated fragments are transferred by simple capillary
action onto a nylon or nitrocellulose membrane, forming the
blot. After the RNA has been transferred, the membrane is

blots can be used to monitor the quantity and breakdown of RNA.
The blot shown illustrates that gadB and gadC are transcribed as
an operon (note the size markers on the left). The gadA gene is
located elsewhere in the genome and is transcribed separately. The
data also illustrate that gadA and gadBC mRNAs accumulate after
growth at pH 5.5. The accumulation is due to increased transcription. A second blot using a gadC probe was used to show that the
larger transcript also contains gadC (not shown). Source: Modified from

hybridized (or “probed”) with a small, labeled DNA fragment (usually made via PCR) that will anneal to a specific
mRNA species on the blot. A similar probing strategy, called
the Southern blot technique, is used to detect the presence
of specific DNA bands (genes) among electrophoretically
separated DNA fragments (see eAppendix 3).
In our acid resistance example, northern blots were used
to ask whether the E. coli acid resistance genes are regulated. The northern blot in Figure 12.7 reveals that when
cells are grown under acidic conditions (low pH), the gadA
gene and the operon gadBC are both induced. The DNA
probe used can bind to either the gadA or gadB mRNA.
Because gadB and gadC form an operon, a longer mRNA
molecule appears on the blot. The RNA bands are also
more intense in the lane from acid-grown cultures (pH 5.5)
than in the lane from cultures grown at high pH (pH 7.7),
suggesting that the transcription of these genes is induced
by acid. An alternative procedure for quantifying levels (but
not sizes) of specific RNA molecules is quantitative (realtime) PCR, which is discussed later in this section.

Western Blots

Another way to examine gene regulation is to detect the
protein products themselves using a technique called the
western blot. The western blot is frequently used in today’s
laboratories. To begin with, the protein extract is subjected
to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
(see Section 10.6 and eAppendix 3). The protein bands are
electrophoretically transferred from the gel to a membrane
made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Fig. 12.8A).

phosphorimager is a machine that records the energy emitted as light or radioactivity from gels or membranes). Only
protein bands to which the primary antibody has bound
will be detected. The technique is used to determine
whether, and at what levels, specific proteins are present in
a cell extract; it can also reveal whether a protein has been
cleaved (processed) from a larger to a smaller form.
In the acid resistance example (Fig. 12.8B), western
blot analysis was performed to detect glutamate decarboxylase protein. The blot shows that the level of this protein is
induced by growth under acidic conditions. Thus, the acidinduced increase in mRNA from transcription (as shown by
northern blot) correlates with an increase in translated protein (as shown by western blot).
Thought Question

12.5 What would you conclude if the northern blot of the gad
genes showed no difference in mRNA levels in cells grown at
pH 5.5 and pH 7.7, but the western blot showed more protein
at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.7?

DNA Mobility Shifts

Once a gene encoding a putative transcriptional regulatory
protein has been identified by sequence annotation, proof of
function requires a demonstration that the protein will bind
to a DNA sequence present in the target promoter area.
One approach is to add purified protein to the putative target DNA fragment and then see whether the protein causes
a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of that fragment in
a gel. An example of this method, as applied to our acid
resistance problem, is illustrated in Figure 12.9A. Linear
DNA molecules travel in agarose or polyacrylamide gels at
an inverse rate relative to their size; that is, larger molecules

■

travel more slowly than smaller ones. If a protein binds to a
DNA molecule, the complex is larger than the DNA alone
and will travel even more slowly in the gel. This method of
analyzing protein-DNA binding is called the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (see Section 10.1).
In our research example, one of the genes that affected
acid resistance (yhiE) was annotated in databases as a
potential transcriptional regulator. The encoded protein
was purified and tested by EMSA for its ability to bind to
the promoter regions of the two potential targets, gadA
and gadBC. As shown in Figure 12.9B, the purified YhiE
protein, renamed GadE because of its role in regulating
glutamic acid decarboxylase expression, did bind the gadA
sequence and retard its mobility. Thus, GadE is a true regulator of the acid resistance genes.

Purifying Proteins by Affinity Tag

How do researchers purify proteins? Today, a protein with
a known sequence can be purified in about a week. The
trick is to fuse the gene encoding the protein to a DNA
sequence encoding a peptide tag that strongly binds a particular small ligand molecule. The target ligand is attached
to beads, and the cell extract containing the tagged protein
is passed over the beads. The tagged protein binds to the
beads, while other proteins do not. This technique, called
affinity chromatography, allows researchers to essentially
“fish” the tagged protein from a complex mixture of proteins present in a cell extract.
There are several commonly used peptide tags. One tag
is a series of six histidines, called a His6 tag, which tightly
binds to nickel. A commercially available plasmid that
is used to make His-tagged proteins includes an inducible promoter constructed by linking the promoter from
T5 phage to two copies of lacO (Fig. 12.10A ). Adding

the lactose analog IPTG will induce transcription (see
Chapter 10) and control when the fusion protein is produced. To make the fusion, the vector (the DNA carrier
molecule) sequentially contains a ribosome-binding site
(RBS), a start ATG codon, a sequence encoding six histidine residues, and a multicloning site (MCS) to insert the
desired open reading frame (ORF). The translational reading frame of the His codons and the codons of the ORF
must be the same to yield a protein fusion.
To purify the resulting protein, nickel-coated beads are
loaded into a column, and then a crude extract containing
the tagged protein is added to the top (Fig. 12.10B). Proteins that do not bind to the nickel (that is, those without
the His6 tag) are eluted with buffer. The tagged protein
molecules that did bind are then eluted from the column
with an elution buffer containing imidazole. Imidazole has
a stronger affinity for the nickel, so it displaces the His6 tagged protein from the beads. Analysis of the progressive purification of GadB by the His6 tag fusion method is
shown in Figure 12.10C.

Mapping Transcriptional Start Sites

Recall from Section 8.1 that promoters have consensus sequences located at –10 and –35 bp from the transcription start site. To begin searching for upstream
promoter sequences, we need to define where each
transcript begins. One method to determine transcript
length is called primer extension (details are provided in
eAppendix 3). In brief, a single DNA primer is designed
to anneal near the 5′ end of an mR NA. Reverse transcriptase, which synthesizes DNA from an R NA template, is then used to extend the primer to the 5′ start of
the message. The result is complementary DNA (cDNA)
of a precise length. When electrophoresed next to a DNA
sequencing ladder of the region (made using the same
primer), the cDNA product aligns with the base corresponding to the transcription start site. eAppendix 3
describes how primer extension was used to identify the
gadA promoter.
Primer extension will identify transcripts for single genes,
but how can transcript start sites for an entire genome be
determined all at once? This is possible using modern deep
sequencing technologies (see Section 10.6). Briefly, wholecell RNA transcripts are extracted from cells and made into
small fragments that are converted to cDNA. The cDNA
is sequenced using next-generation sequencing platforms.
Computer programs then assemble the fragments and align
them with the genomic DNA sequence. An example of this
strategy is shown in Figure 12.11A. The 5′ end of each
assembled, nonoverlapping transcript is presumed to be the
transcriptional start site. So the segment in the figure contains two transcripts—or does it?

RNA molecules can undergo a type of processing in
which a long transcript starting from a bona fide promoter
is cleaved into smaller fragments. So, is transcript B in
Figure 12.11A made from its own promoter, or is it a product made from a larger transcript encompassing A and B?
Recall that the 5′ nucleotide in all primary RNA transcripts is a triphosphate, whereas the first nucleotide of a
cleaved (processed) transcript has to be a monophosphate
(Fig. 12.11B). This distinction led to a novel differential
RNA sequencing (dRNAseq) approach that was developed to discover primary transcriptional start sites on
a genome-wide scale. It uses the 5′-monophosphatedependent terminator exonuclease (TEX) that specifically degrades 5′-monophosphorylated RNA species, such
as processed RNA (including mature rRNA and tRNA).
Any 5′-triphosphorylated RNA species (primary transcripts) remain intact. This approach makes it possible to
identify primary-transcript start sites by comparing TEXtreated transcripts with untreated libraries. The dRNAseq
procedure has been used to identify primary transcripts in
numerous species, including small RNAs (sRNAs) in the
plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris.

DNA Protection Analysis Identifies
DNA-Protein Contacts

Although EMSA identifies DNA fragments bound by a
transcriptional regulatory protein, the technique does not
reveal which nucleotides are bound. There are several techniques that can do this. One method asks which nucleotides
are protected from nuclease digestion when a regulatory
protein binds to a DNA fragment. The protected bases represent what is called the “footprint” of the binding protein.
Identifying specific nucleotide-protein interactions between
transcriptional regulators and their target sites (for instance,
an activator of a pathogenicity operon) provides insight into
how these interactions promote or inhibit transcription.
Because a regulatory protein covers DNA at its bindingsite sequence, an enzyme that might attack the sequence
cannot get close enough to do damage. Deoxyribonuclease
I (DNase I), one of many different types of DNases, is one
such enzyme. It cleaves phosphodiester bonds between bases.
Figure 12.12 presents the DNase I footprinting technique.
In this method, DNase I is added to a DNA fragment at a
concentration that can nick each molecule only once during
the incubation period (Fig. 12.12A). When the DNA is
later denatured by heat, arrays of single-stranded fragments
are produced (Fig. 12.12B). Each fragment is a different
size, depending on where the nick occurred. Because only
one end of one strand of the DNA is labeled (by radiation
or fluorescence), only the fragments containing that label
will be seen following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and autoradiography.

Figure 12.12C presents the actual footprint of GadX,
another regulator of E. coli acid resistance. The regulatory
protein GadX covers a region around the promoter of gadA
and gadB (only gadA is shown). The region is immediately
upstream of the promoter. It is thought that both regulatory proteins GadE (previously described) and GadX communicate with RNA polymerase at the promoter, allowing
it to transcribe the acid resistance genes.
DNA protection assays do not definitively show contact
points between protein and DNA. Areas of the protein only
have to be close enough to the DNA to hinder nuclease
access. Protein-DNA interaction sites can be better defined

by other, more difficult methods that cause a cross-link
between amino acids of the protein and the specific bases
they contact in the DNA. Nevertheless, the DNA protection assay remains a useful tool.

Thought Question

12.6 Another regulator of glutamate decarboxylase (Gad)
production does not affect the production of gad mRNA, but
is required to accumulate Gad protein. What two regulatory
mechanisms might account for this phenotype?

Another modification of the PCR technique is called quantitative (real-time) PCR (RT PCR). Real-time PCR uses fluorescence to monitor the progress of PCR as it occurs (that is,
in real time). Data are collected throughout the PCR process
rather than just at the end of the reaction. Quantitative PCR
can be used to quantify the level of DNA or RNA in a sample. DNA is quantified by how long it takes to first detect an
amplified product while the polymerase chain reaction is still
running. The higher the starting copy number of the nucleic
acid target, the sooner a significant increase in fluorescence is
observed. Thus, the time at which fluorescence increases is a
reflection of the amount of nucleic acid in the original sample.
How does quantitative PCR work? Two techniques are
commonly used. In one, a compound called SYBR green is

Visualizing the Interactions
and Movements of Proteins

When a cell encounters a change in its environment, the
impact on the cell radiates along and between pathways
affecting many different genes and proteins. Tracking
these global regulatory influences can show how a species adjusts its physiology to better tolerate, or even flourish in, a new environment. Transcriptomic and proteomic
techniques described in Chapters 7, 8, and 10 reveal the
global changes in mRNA and protein levels that cells
undergo when entering new environments. Here we will
show how to reveal interaction networks between proteins
and genes, and between proteins and proteins. We will
also see how to track protein movements through cells.

Whole-Genome DNA-Binding
Analysis: ChIP-seq

The techniques discussed in Section 12.2 are great for identifying a protein-DNA binding site where you already suspect
that the protein binds. But is there a way to blindly determine
all the sites in a genome to which a given protein binds? There
is, and the basic process, called ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq)
is outlined in Figure 12.15. In the cell, the DNA-binding
protein of interest (a transcription factor, TF) binds to all of
its DNA target sites in the genome. The cells are treated with
formaldehyde to covalently cross-link proteins to DNA. The
DNA and its bound proteins are isolated and sheared into
small fragments. Next, the transcription factor–DNA complexes are “fished” from the extract using tiny beads with

antibodies attached that bind only to that particular TF protein. The beads are pelleted by centrifugation, which “pulls
down” antibody bound to the TF protein–DNA complexes.
Unbound DNA fragments are washed away. This process is
called chromatin immunoprecipitation, or ChIP.
Next, the protein-DNA cross-links are removed (usually
by heat), and the released DNA fragments are amplified
by PCR. (To amplify the unknown fragments, the fragments are ligated at both ends to linker oligonucleotides
that can be amplified by known primers containing fluorescent dye.) The fluorescently tagged, amplified fragments

Many cellular proteins interact with and influence the
function of other proteins in the cell. For example, antisigma factors help control the timing of sporulation in
Bacillus by interacting with sigma proteins. Many proteins, such as RNA polymerase and the ribosome, function as components of multisubunit complexes. However,
there are other intracellular situations in which protein
complexes can simplify physiological processes. A complex
containing fatty acid biosynthesis enzymes, for instance,
allows intermediates to pass quickly from one subunit to
another without having to diffuse through the cell. Thus,
all the protein-protein interactions of a living cell, which
are collectively referred to as the interactome, are essential to the normal workings of the cell. Unraveling these
interactions is an invaluable way of understanding protein
function. How, then, does one map an interactome?
Yeast two-hybrid analysis. It is important to probe

protein-protein interactions in vivo, where the proteins
actually work. An ingenious tool to measure in vivo protein-protein interaction is the two-hybrid system. Twohybrid analysis can be used to mine for unknown “prey”
proteins that interact with a known “bait” protein.
While there are many types of two-hybrid techniques, a
classic example is the yeast two-hybrid system shown in
Figure 12.16. In yeast two-hybrid analysis, genes encoding two potentially interacting proteins are fused to separated parts of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor, which is
normally one protein (Fig. 12.16A). One gene is fused to
the GAL4 activation domain, while the other gene is fused
to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. If the two proteins of
interest interact with each other, then the two parts of GAL4
are brought together. The DNA-binding domain binds to the
yeast GAL1 gene promoter region, and the activation domain
(towed behind by the interacting proteins) is positioned to
bind RNA polymerase and stimulate GAL1 transcription.
The target reporter gene is typically a chromosomal
GAL1-lacZ transcriptional fusion, although other reporter
genes can be used. When the two hybrid proteins interact,
the complex activates transcription of GAL1-lacZ, which is
visualized on agar plates containing X-Gal. X-Gal is a colorless substrate of beta-galactosidase that, when cleaved,
produces a blue product.
The power of this technique is that it can also be used
to find unknown proteins that interact with a known protein. A known protein fused to one of the GAL4 domains

can be used as “bait” to find the “prey” proteins expressed
by randomly cloned “prey” genes fused to the other
GAL4 domain. Plasmids containing the bait and prey
fusions are transformed into yeast cells, and the transformants are plated onto a medium containing X-Gal.
Colonies that express beta-galactosidase are the result of
protein-protein interactions between the bait and prey
fusion proteins. Sequencing the DNA insertion can then
identify the gene encoding the prey protein. An example
of two-hybrid analysis is shown in Figure 12.16B.
Another approach to mapping interactomes uses individual
bait proteins to pluck all of a particular protein’s interacting
partners out of the cell. A small-peptide affinity tag added to
one end of the bait protein will allow the bait protein and its
interacting proteins to be purified by affinity chromatography.
The process is described in eTopic 12.1. A graphical representation of part of an interactome is shown in Figure 12.17.

12.8 You suspect that proteins A and C can simultaneously
bind to protein B, and that this interaction then allows A to interact with C in the complex. How could you use two-hybrid analysis to determine whether these three proteins can interact?

Tracking Cells with Light

The use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to track the
location of plasmids and nucleoids in living bacteria is
described at the start of Chapter 7. GFP technology can
also be used to target how microbial proteins move through
eukaryotic cells. For instance, the potato virus X (or potexvirus) is a positive-strand RNA virus (a positive-strand
RNA is equivalent to mRNA). One viral protein, called
TBGp3, is required for the virus to move between plant
cells. Investigators fused GFP to the TBGp3 protein and
asked where the protein ended up in the plant leaves. They
delivered the genes to plant cells by bombarding leaves with
the fusion plasmids. As shown in Figure 12.18, GFP alone

was diffusely located throughout the leaf. However, the
GFP-TBGp3 fusion protein inserted only into the reticulated network of veins. Altering specific residues within the
protein via mutation prevented this localization, causing
the fusion protein to remain diffused throughout the plant
cells. These results suggest that TBGp3 protein helps guide
the virus through the plant’s reticulated network.
This type of gene fusion technology has been used extensively to trace the movement and final location of numerous proteins delivered into host cells by pathogenic bacteria.
GFP tagging has also been used to track the intermingling
of different bacteria forming a biofilm (eTopic 12.2).

Applied Biotechnology

It is remarkable how many useful products can be imagined
and are being developed using the tools of biotechnology (see
Chapter 16). You may be surprised to learn that plants have
been engineered to produce microbial vaccines, and that vaccines can be delivered not only by injecting a protein, but by
simply injecting DNA or RNA that encodes the antigenic
protein (DNA vaccines are discussed in eTopic 12.3). We even
have technology that uses a genetically engineered virus to
repair a human genetic defect (eTopic 12.4). These are all
remarkable additions to our scientific toolbox and are already
helping to improve human life.

Protecting crops such as corn and cotton
from hungry insects is an age-old problem. Insects such as moths or beetles
can cause widespread damage to a crop
in a short period of time. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, chemical
pesticides were widely used to kill these
pests. While generally effective, chemical pesticides can contaminate soil and
groundwater and can impact human
health. Through bioengineering, we
now have a better, safer way.

Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a close relative of Bacillus
anthracis, sporulates on the surfaces of plants. In addition
to the spore, the sporulating cell makes a separate parasporal body that cradles the spore (Fig. 12.19). The parasporal body contains crystallized proteins that are toxic
to insects feeding on the plant. A single subspecies of B.
thuringiensis can produce multiple insecticidal proteins.
After the insect or insect larva ingests the insecticidal protein crystals, the alkaline environment in the insect midgut dissolves the crystals, and insect proteases inadvertently
activate the proteins. Activated insecticidal proteins insert
into the membrane of the midgut cells and form pores that
lead to a loss of membrane potential, cell lysis, and death
of the insect through starvation. It is also proposed that
death is due to septicemia by enteric bacteria that escape
the damaged midgut (antibiotic treatment reduces death).
Because of its effectiveness, farmers have taken to spreading
B. thuringiensis directly on their crops, where even dead
cells are effective.
B. thuringiensis is considered a highly beneficial pesticide with few downsides. Unlike most insecticides,
B. thuringiensis insecticides do not have a broad spectrum of activity, so they do not kill animals or beneficial insects—including the natural enemies of harmful
insects (predators and parasites) and beneficial pollinators
(such as honeybees). Therefore, B. thuringiensis integrates
well with other natural crop controls. Perhaps the major
advantage is that B. thuringiensis is nontoxic to people,
pets, and wildlife, so it is safe to use on food crops or in

other sensitive sites where chemical pesticides can cause adverse
effects.
Although spreading B. thuringiensis on crops is helpful, an
even more effective means of
delivering the toxin has been
developed. The genes encoding
insecticidal proteins have been
spliced right into the genomes of
agriculturally important plants
such as cotton and corn. The
gene is placed under the control
of a plant promoter, so that the
transgenic plant makes its own
insecticide. As of 2013, over 75%
of the cotton and corn planted
in the United States contains
B. thuringiensis genes. Rigorous scientific studies have shown
that foods from these transgenic
plants are safe.

Thought Question

12.9 Would insect resistance to an insecticidal protein be a

concern when developing a transgenic plant? Why or why not?
How would you design a transgenic plant to limit the possibility of insects developing resistance?

Vaccine Proteins Produced in Plants

Starting with the war against smallpox in the late 1700s,
vaccines have been used to inoculate humans against
many terrible diseases (see Chapters 25 and 26). However, the cost of producing them is enormous, and the
price, of course, is passed on to those who are vaccinated or to governments that conduct vaccination programs. Because the cost is problematic for impoverished
nations, 20% of the world’s infants are not vaccinated
properly, resulting in over 2 million preventable deaths
annually.
One potential solution to this problem was to engineer
plants to express vaccine proteins. The gene encoding a
vaccine protein is inserted into the genome of a plant so
that the plant makes the vaccine protein as part of itself.
The vaccine gene must be placed under the control of a
well-expressed plant promoter (recently, plastid genes have
been used). Transgenic plants expressing bacterial or viral
virulence proteins can be used in two ways: They can be
direct vaccine delivery systems, as through edible fruits
and vegetables (such as potatoes, tomatoes, and corn);

CHAPTER 12

or, as with transgenic tobacco crops, they can be a cheap
way to grow large amounts of the vaccine protein that can
be extracted later and used in more conventional ways.
Producing vaccine in edible fruits was an attractive idea
because the fruit could be grown locally and distributed
to residents of poor countries even without refrigeration.
But practical and ethical problems have, so far, prevented
implementation. The use of engineered plants to mass-produce and purify vaccine proteins, however, especially for
use in animals, is happening. Plants used to make vaccines
are listed in Table 12.2.

GENES AND GENOMES

peptides, antibodies cloned from natural sources, or libraries (collections) of mutant enzymes that one wishes to
study. Phage display enables scientists to screen for peptide
variants with altered properties such as increased affinity
for ligand.
The phage vectors used most often are the filamentous bacteriophages fd and M13 (discussed in eTopic 11.2).
These phages infect E. coli strains containing the F plasmid (the phages attach to the sex pili) and replicate without
killing the host cell. The phage particle consists of a single-stranded DNA molecule encapsulated in a long, cylindrical capsid made up of five proteins. The product of gene
3 (g3p)—present in three to five copies—confers phage
infectivity. Most phage display libraries have been produced
by cloning into gene 3.
Peptides displayed on filamentous phages have been used
to select peptides, including antibodies, with high affinities for receptors or antigens (see Section 24.2). Recombinant phages that display high-affinity binding peptides
are isolated from libraries in a process called biopanning
(Fig. 12.20B). In biopanning, the target ligand—for
example, a human virus attachment protein—is attached
to a plastic plate or other support, and phages displaying
random peptides are added. The phages that do not stick
to the human virus protein are washed away. Those that do
bind are subsequently released by adding free ligand (for
example, human virus protein). This process is analogous
to the way miners would pan rivers for gold. Several rounds
of biopanning are required to obtain high-affinity clones.
Following each round, the selected phages are enriched
by repropagation in E. coli. Phage display was successfully
used to identify high-affinity peptides that bind to attachment proteins of some eukaryotic viruses. These virusbinding peptides effectively block viral infection. More
recently, phage display was used to identify specific singlechain antibodies that bind to a surface protein uniquely
present on cancer cells. The antibody disrupts the function
of this protein and significantly decreases viability of the
cancer cell.
Phage display can also be used for directed evolution
projects that retool enzymes (directed evolution is discussed in Chapter 17). Natural enzymes, because they
were selected by evolution to sustain life, do not necessarily have the stability or catalytic activity that would
make them suitable for more harsh biotechnological
applications. Phage display, with its ability to screen millions of mutants, can quickly find the variant with the
desired trait. An example of how phage display was used
to direct the evolution of a more effective beta-lactamase
enzyme that cleaves penicillin is described in eTopic 12.5.
Other in vitro evolution techniques—DNA shuffling and
site-directed mutagenesis—are described in eTopics 12.6
and 12.7.

Thought Question

12.10 You have just employed phage display technology to
select for a protein that tightly binds and blocks the eukaryotic cell receptor targeted by anthrax toxin. When this receptor
is blocked, the toxin cannot get into the target cell. You suspect that the protein may be a useful treatment for anthrax.
How would you recover the gene following phage display and
then express and purify the protein product?

In addition to what we describe here, microbes have been
genetically engineered for many other applications that we
will discuss in later chapters. These applications include the
bioremediation of organic wastes (Chapter 13) and inorganic wastes (Chapter 14); mine leaching (Chapter 14);

Biocontainment: “Who
Let the Bugs Out?”

Since the advent of genetic engineering in the 1970s, scientists and ethicists have struggled with how to prevent
the accidental escape of a genetically engineered microbial
“Frankenstein” from the lab. Physical containment such as
air locks at the entrances of some labs is necessary to prevent the escape of lethal pathogens (see Section 28.6), but
what about genetically modified organisms (GMOs)? The
potential consequences of releasing GMOs into an environment are largely unknown. A GMO designed for laboratory
use but accidentally released into the natural environment
might alter ecological balances through competition or by
sharing modified genes with other organisms in the environment. A highly improbable, but not inconceivable,
concern is that a GMO microbe could evolve to become
pathogenic to plants, animals, or humans. With these
unknowns in mind, might there be a way to efficiently contain these organisms without resorting to extreme physical containment strategies? For instance, could we engineer
the organisms to quickly self-destruct if they escape the
laboratory environment?
Existing biocontainment strategies employ natural auxotrophies that are not easily met in nature, or conditional
suicide switches introduced into the organism’s genome
(described in Section 12.5). But many of these mechanisms can be compromised through metabolic crossfeeding or genetic mutation. However, a promising new
approach involving a bioengineered synthetic auxotrophy
has emerged from the Yale University laboratory of Farren
Isaacs. This team of scientists altered the genetic code of an
E. coli strain to require an unnatural amino acid found only

CHAPTER 12

in laboratories. To recode the bacterium, they replaced all
UAG stop codons with UAA stop codons. They then converted UAG into a sense codon by introducing an orthologous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase–tRNA pair derived from
the archaean Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. The tRNA
recognizes the UAG codon, and the amino acid binding
pocket of the tRNA synthetase was modified to accept the
unnatural amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine (pAzF). The
new tRNA synthetase will charge the UAG tRNA with
pAzF.
Finally, UAG codons were introduced into three essential genes encoding DnaA (initiation of replication), MurG
(peptidoglycan synthesis), and SerS (serine aminoacyl
tRNA synthetase). For this strain to grow, the unnatural
amino acid pAzF must be incorporated by translation into
those three essential proteins. Because pAzF is not found
in the environment, any recoded microbe released from the
lab will die and not pose a threat. Synthetic auxotrophies
like the one just described will allow us to control when
and where genetically engineered microbes of unknown
risk can grow.

tell us about it? Or detect pathogens or keep time? Or

maybe even remember things—much like a computer?
These are all goals of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological parts,
devices, and systems for a desired purpose, similar to building electronic circuits.
How do we make these new parts or components? All
living organisms already contain an instruction set encoded
in DNA that determines what the creature looks like and
what it does. Humans have been altering the genetic codes
of plants and animals for millennia by selectively breeding individual plants and animals with desirable features.
Today, scientists easily take pieces of genetic information
from one organism and insert them directly into another,
bypassing the need to breed. This is the basis of genetic
engineering.
Recent technological advances now allow scientists to
synthesize and manipulate DNA in ways never before possible. By applying engineering principles to these genetic
manipulations, researchers can take components of genes
from several different organisms, link them together
like Lego blocks, and design new organisms that do
new things. For instance, Jay Keasling’s laboratory (UC
Berkeley) used genes from several species to engineer a
new pathway for artemisinin, an important antimalarial
drug. By exploiting E. coli, Keasling’s team eliminated
the effort required to chemically synthesize a structurally
complex molecule. In another example, Chang Li and colleagues (Harvard Medical School) engineered an E. coli
that prevented cancer in mice. The new strain contained
the invasin gene from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and the
hemolysin gene from Listeria monocytogenes. The invasin
gene allowed the modified E. coli to invade mouse cells.
The hemolysin enabled delivery of an inhibitory small
RNA molecule that reduced expression of a tumor-initiating gene. Amazingly, this novel E. coli prevented cancer
in this mouse model.

Principles of Synthetic Biology

The key to synthetic biology is engineering. Among the
more visually intriguing ways to apply engineering principles to biological systems involves the use of GFP as a visual
on-or-off output; that is, cells light up or go dark. If you
build the biological circuit correctly, you can make a population of bacteria alert you to the presence of a toxic compound by flashing on and off (Special Topic 12.1).
What engineering principles are employed by syntheticbiology scientists? Many of them are borrowed from the
field of electrical engineering and involve “logic gates.”
An electronic logic gate (as in semiconductors) receives a
tiny current as an input and produces voltage as an output. A genetic logic gate is simply a promoter and a gene.
An input signal such as a regulatory protein affects the

GENES AND GENOMES

We know that bacteria “talk” to each other using signaling molecules, but with synthetic biology can we also
train them to keep time? The answer appears to be yes.
Jeff Hasty’s laboratory at UC San Diego constructed a network circuit that relies on quorum sensing to propagate a
signal through a population of cells (Fig. 1). The network
design is shown in Figure 2. The organism, E. coli, was built
to contain the luxL gene from Vibrio fischeri and the aiiA
gene from Bacillus thuringiensis. LuxL synthase produces
an acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducer (see Chapter 10); AiiA is a secreted enzyme that degrades extracellular AHL. Both luxL and aiiA have a luxL promoter that can
be activated by LuxR bound to AHL. LuxR was also engineered into this synthetic organism, but it is constitutively
expressed. The output signal is a form of GFP, so the cells
glow when the circuit is on.
How does it work? Figure 3 shows what happens when
these cells are grown as a streak on an agar plate. The system produces a flash of emission that propagates bidirectionally along the streak and then shuts off. The flash starts
at a point in the colony where AHL stochastically accumulates at a low level. The secreted AHL reenters nearby cells,
where AHL binds LuxR and activates the expression of all
three circuits in the cell cluster. Those cells then glow (see
the 100-minute panel in Fig. 3). The new burst of AHL diffuses and activates more nearby cells, which also start to
glow (the 106- and 118-minute panels). Because the AHL
signal diffuses away from the producing cells, the light wave
propagates through the streak. However, the AiiA enzyme
that degrades AHL is also made and secreted by the glowing cells. AiiA degrades AHL and shuts the system off beginning where the light wave started (the 138-minute panel).
The remaining GFP is degraded by cell proteases, and cells
stop glowing. But now, without AHL, AiiA is no longer made.
Consequently, small amounts of AHL can again accumulate
at some point in the streak and the migrating flash begins
again (the 170- and 180-minute panels).

promoter, which drives the output signal (mRNA and protein). The output signal for one gate can be an input signal
for another part of the logic circuit. The final output signal
of the circuit does something useful or eye-catching (think
GFP fluorescence).
Many of the symbols used in building an electronic circuit are also used when building a complex genetic circuit.
Figure 12.21 shows three common logic gates used in synthetic biology and the symbols that represent them. The
first is a “buffer gate” that amplifies signals (Fig. 12.21A).
For a simple gene, the protein input activates a promoter;

(right) and Arthur Prindle examine a culture used for their
synchronous-clock experiments.
The system was then modified to be a sensor for arsenic.
For this purpose, luxR was placed under the control of a promoter repressed by ArsR. Arsenic inactivates the ArsR repressor. In the absence of arsenic, flashing was not seen, because
LuxR is needed to activate the luxP-gfp fusion. When even small

a message is then transcribed and a protein is made. With
a “NOT gate,” a protein input represses a promoter and
the output protein is not made (Fig. 12.21B). Finally, an
“OR gate” involves several genes. For instance, two alternative gene output proteins can activate a third gene. So,
in Figure 12.21C, the alternative input proteins I1 and I 2
activate gene 1 or gene 2, respectively, to make product 1
or product 2 (Pr1 or Pr2). Either of those output signals can
activate gene 3 to make product 3, Pr3 (such as GFP). Once
you understand how these gates work, you can make any
kind of circuit.

Toggle Switches

Electrical systems rely heavily on toggle switches to control whether a system is turned on or off. Similarly, synthetic-biology circuits depend on biological toggle switches.
Figure 12.22 illustrates a basic, genetically engineered toggle
switch designed to control whether a gfp gene is turned on
or off. The circuit involves two repressor genes (called NOT
gates) whose products can repress each other’s transcription.
The switch depends on whether one of two different inducer
signals is present. Inducer 1 inactivates repressor 1, which
means repressor 2 is produced. Repressor 2, in turn, stops

So, when inducer 1 is added, GFP is not made and the system
is stably toggled off. Alternatively, inducer 2 inactivates repressor 2, which means that the genes for repressor 1 and GFP are
transcribed and the cell lights up. The system is stably toggled
on because repressor 1 halts transcription of repressor 2. So,
a genetic engineer can control the on/off switch of these cells
by adding one or the other inducer. Of course, for this system
to toggle, at least a small amount of both repressor proteins
must be made at all times—just enough to bind to inducer
molecules and have an effect on gene expression.

systems discussed in Chapter 10. One component is the
gene for the AraC activator protein, which was linked by
Hasty’s group to a hybrid operator region that included
an ara activator sequence and a LacI repressor control
sequence. The next component is the gene encoding the
repressor LacI, which was also spliced to the hybrid ara

Before we discuss more complex circuits, we should first
talk about “noise.” Noise (variance from a mean) is a
problem in any electrical circuit but also arises in biological circuits, because of f luctuations of gene expression
among single cells in a population (see Section 12.1).
The concept of noise in a biological or electrical system
might be best explained by the following analogy. Imagine you are at a concert and your friend is trying to talk
to you. You can’t understand what she is saying, because
the sound of her voice is not rising above the music and
all of the background noise. The band would have to go
quiet in order for you to hear her. The same is true for
anything you want to measure. The less noise there is,
the easier it is to measure what rises above it. In bacteria,
translation inefficiency is a major contributor to noise,
although many factors can inf luence the expression of a
gene (Fig. 12.24). To be useful, synthetic biological circuits must operate with transcriptional and translational
controls balanced in a way that minimizes noise. Choosing the right ribosome-binding sequence and promoter,
as well as using a small R NA to control message stability
or translation, can help to decrease noise.

■ The basic synthetic riboswitch. Cis-repressed mRNA (crRNA) folds to obscure a ribosome-binding site (RBS) needed
to translate a downstream output gene (A). Trans-activating RNA (taRNA), driven by a different promoter (B), can base-pair with crRNA (C),
thus opening up the hairpin to expose the RBS. Whatever activates the taRNA will activate translation of the output genes’ mRNA.

riboswitch consists of two parts: a cis-repressed mRNA
(crRNA) and a trans-activating RNA (taRNA). The crRNA
sequence is linked to an output gene and, by forming a
hairpin, hides a ribosome-binding site to prevent translation. The taRNA, once it is made, will promote translation
of the output gene by base-pairing with the crRNA. The
base pairing releases the RBS for translation. Transcription
and translation of the output gene can now be manipulated
by whatever activates the promoters used to express the
crRNA and taRNA genes. This process can reduce noise
in a system.
Members of James Collins’s laboratory (Harvard University) designed a series of matched crRNA/taRNA riboswitches and linked them to various promoters and output
genes. The design and response of these circuits to various
environmental signals is shown in Figure 12.26. Notice
that each riboswitch responded to only one signal.
The Collins group then linked these riboswitches to
genes encoding carbon metabolism enzymes and placed
them all in the same cell, essentially making a metabolic
switchboard that could channel carbon flow through alternative metabolic pathways depending on which riboswitch
was activated. Metabolic switchboards would have important industrial applications. For instance, the device could
simultaneously sense a variety of metabolic states in a large

batch fermentation system and maximize the efficiency of
an industrially attractive pathway.

Kill Switches

Most of what we have described about synthetic biology has
little chance of dangerous unintended consequences, but
what about the long term? Biologists would like to engineer new strains that do new tasks, such as gobble up toxins in the environment. Remediating toxin contamination
in nature, however, would require the release of genetically modified organisms outside the laboratory. This raises
concerns about potential, unknown havoc these organisms
might cause.
To allay these concerns, scientists must engineer failsafe mechanisms that kill the organism at a predetermined point. Hence the quest for effective “kill switches.”
A genetically modified organism equipped with a kill
switch can be made to commit suicide once the bacterium’s job is done. One proof-of-principle kill switch
engineered by synthetic-biology techniques is shown in
Figure 12.27.
The gene for CcdB, a potent DNA-damaging toxin,
was linked to the promoter PLtetO , which is repressed by
the TetR protein. Repression is relieved (and CcdB is made)

only when an analog of tetracycline is present. Tetracycline binds
and inactivates TetR, which then
releases from the ccd promoter. As
a result, the kill toxin gene ccdB
is expressed and can kill the cell.
The engineers, however, added
a fail-safe mechanism to prevent
the organism from killing itself
too early. They made sure that
the translation of CcdB mRNA
is blocked by a crRNA. A second
component of the system, activated by arabinose, encodes the
compensatory taRNA that can
expose the RBS buried within the
crRNA-CcdB message. So, both
tetracycline and arabinose must
be added for the cell to effectively
produce CcdB and kill itself.
Although this system, as
designed, is impractical for realworld use, its success shows that
kill switches can be made. How
could this kill switch be modified so that it could be used in
the real world? What if repression
of CcdB was tied to the presence
of a toxic product found in the
environment? Once the organism destroyed the toxin, the kill
switch would be “thrown,” and
the bacterium would kill itself.

MIT (the iGEM competition trophy is a large aluminum

cells to one that makes cells smell like bananas.
Despite its potential for good, one concern about synthetic biology is that anyone, theoretically, can do it. In
fact, the lure of constructing a new organism, combined
with the ever-lowering cost of equipment needed to carry
out these experiments, has spawned a community of doit-yourself (DIY) genetic engineers, including high school
students and so-called garage scientists. Most of these DIY
efforts are well-intentioned and could yield useful products
as a result of outside-the-box thinking, but we should be

Tinkering with gene circuits is one thing, but carrying out
a complete genome transplant is another. We have been
able to manipulate small pieces of bacterial genomes for
many years via mutation, cloning, and recombination techniques. But manipulating an entire genome has been out of
reach—until now. Scientists have taken the genome of one
bacterial species, Mycoplasma mycoides, moved it to yeast
(they added a yeast centromere so that it would replicate),
modified the genome using yeast genetics, and then transplanted the modified genome into a different species, Mycoplasma capricolum, replacing the M. capricolum genome.
This biotechnological advance is especially exciting because
genetic manipulation of M. mycoides was previously impossible. Using this technique, we might redesign bacterial
systems and even engineer new species.

Gut bacteria share their catabolic enzymes. Bacteroides
fragilis are prominent Gram-negative bacteria of our colonic
microbiome. Colonic bacteria compete intensely for the
carbon sources ingested by the host. But Bacteroides species
actually release their catabolic enzymes into the community,
by pinching off vesicles from the outer membrane. These
outer membrane vesicles contain enzymes that break down
lipids, carbohydrates, and peptides into small molecules.
Vesicle formation increases the surface area for catabolism,
but it also makes the catabolites available to unrelated
bacteria. This unexpected resource sharing is important for

What is so exciting about intestinal
bacteria exporting catabolic enzymes
in vesicles?

Bacteroides species digest a broad
spectrum of polysaccharides in the
human gut, including host-derived
glycans. We showed that the bacteria
selectively secrete a large number of
sugar hydrolases via outer membrane
vesicles. The liposomal nature of vesicles stabilizes the
secreted hydrolases compared to the soluble form. Moreover, the secretion of hydrolases into vesicles enables the
bacteria to use out-of-reach nutrients.
How do you think our assumptions will change about
patterns of catabolism in the microbiome?

0.5 µm

Bacteroides fragilis can regulate the level of hydrolases
packed into outer membrane vesicles in response to the
kinds of glycans available. These results suggest that outer
membrane vesicle secretion is a regulated process that helps
Bacteroides adapt to its niche. Other researchers have shown
that Bacteroides vesicle hydrolases also target key molecules
in the host signaling pathways. In addition, vesicle sulfatases
play a fundamental role in the inflammatory response triggered by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron during colitis.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

The intestines of humans and other animals support vast
communities of microbes that digest much of the food
we consume. Many of our gut microbes break down food
molecules using enzymes that our bodies don’t have—thus
extending the repertoire of our genome. The microbes
grow as mutualists, while our bodies provide a home in
return for breakdown of complex foods into small molecules that we can digest. Microbes catabolize (break down
for energy) many carbon sources that animals cannot. For
example, soil bacteria such as Pseudomonas species may
catabolize benzene and chlorinated pollutants.
But who would have thought that digestive bacteria are
also mutualists of each other? We have long assumed that
the vast number of intestinal microbes compete with each
other for food. Yet recent research shows that bacteria such
as Bacteroides species actually share their catabolic enzymes
with the community. The enzymes are shared by vesicles

pinched off from the bacterium’s outer membrane (see the
Current Research Highlight). The outer membrane (discussed in Chapter 3) contains enzyme complexes that break
down polysaccharides to oligosaccharides (short sugar
chains) and transport the oligosaccharides to the periplasm
(Fig. 13.1). These enzymes and transporters comprise the
“starch utilization system” (SUS). Within the periplasm,
oligosaccharides are further degraded to monosaccharides,
which then cross the inner membrane to the cytoplasm. At
the same time, some of the outer membrane pinches off to
form outer membrane vesicles. These vesicles include some
of the SusD starch-binding proteins, as well as glycosidases
(sugar breakdown), lipases (fat digestion), and peptidases
(protein breakdown). Their breakdown products diffuse
back to Bacteroides cells, as well as to other bacteria.
Why share catabolic enzymes? Amazingly, Bacteroides
species possess hundreds of SUS homologs for polysaccharide catabolism and transport. Catabolism is reactions that
break down complex organic substrates (discussed in Section 13.4). Different versions of SUS proteins catabolize
different types of polysaccharides, such as those with sulfated sugars. Suppose two different species possess enzymes
for different steps of a pathway. Individually, the two bacteria might not digest a certain substrate, but together they
may complete its breakdown. The surprising
nutritional cooperation of our microbiome
is discussed further in Chapter 21.

Living organisms need energy to build cells. Cell growth must spend energy while synthesizing biomass and

or cell growth. Energy is used to organize proteins, maintain ion gradients, and build biomass (Fig. 13.2). Yet the
second law of thermodynamics tells us that systems tend
to become less ordered and that entropy—the disorder, or
randomness, of the universe—always increases. For life to
build order out of disorder, cells need energy.

Many Sources of Energy

Collectively, microbes use more diverse energy sources
than do multicellular organisms (Table 13.1). Recall from
Chapter 4 that an organism may gain energy from chemical
rearrangement of molecules (prefix “chemo-”) or from light
absorption (prefix “photo-”). Chemotrophy yields energy
from electron transfer between chemicals, yielding products
that are more stable. Chemotrophy in which organic
compounds donate electrons to yield energy is known as
organotrophy or chemoorganotrophy. Organic compounds
include the foods we eat—which our intestinal bacteria
help catabolize. Most organotrophs are also heterotrophs,
organisms that use preformed organic compounds
for biosynthesis (a process called heterotrophy). But
chemotrophy also includes lithotrophy or chemolithotrophy
(literally “rock eating”), obtaining energy from inorganic
reactions. For example, the archaeon Pyrodictium occultum
gains energy by oxidizing hydrogen gas with sulfur.
Phototrophy yields energy from light absorption.
Phototrophs such as marine cyanobacteria are autotrophs.
A photoautotroph gains energy solely from light and builds
biomass solely from CO2. Other bacteria, such as purple

proteobacteria, practice photoheterotrophy, in which
energy from light supplements chemotrophy. Phototrophy
and lithotrophy are discussed in Chapter 14.
But all sources of energy pose the challenges of how to
obtain the energy, how to avoid losing it, and how to convert it for cell growth and function.

Note:

Distinguish the following prefixes for “-trophy” terms.

Carbon source for biomass
Auto- CO2 is fixed and assembled into organic molecules.
Hetero- Preformed organic molecules are acquired from outside and assembled into new organic molecules.
Energy source
Photo- Light absorption captures energy.
Chemo- Chemical reactions yield energy without absorbing
light.
Electron source
Litho- Inorganic molecules donate electrons.
Organo- Organic molecules donate electrons.

Microbes Use Energy to Build Order

Since the universe overall becomes more disordered, how
can microbes use energy to assemble less-ordered molecules into a complex cell? As order increases, the cell is
said to decrease in entropy, or disorder. But the decrease
in entropy is local to the cell, and temporary. Ultimately,
the cell’s energy must be spent as heat, which radiates away,

causing entropy to increase. In other words, the local, temporary gain of energy enables a cell to grow. Continued
growth requires continual gain of energy and continual
radiation of heat. We see this release of heat, for example, in
a compost pile, where heat is produced faster than it dissipates. The temperature of compost typically rises to 60°C.
Similarly, throughout Earth’s biosphere, the total
metabolism of all life must dissipate energy as heat. Biological heat production is not always obvious, because soil and
water provide a tremendous heat sink. But overall, Earth’s
biosphere behaves as a giant thermal reactor (Fig. 13.3). As
solar radiation reaches Earth, a small fraction is captured by
photosynthetic microbes and plants. The fraction captured
is largely in the range of visible light (Fig. 13.4), the wavelengths at which photon energies are appropriate for the
controlled formation and dissociation of molecular bonds.
Some bacteria conduct photosynthesis using ultraviolet and

near-infrared radiation. At shorter wavelengths (X-rays),
chemical bonds are broken indiscriminately; at longer wavelengths (microwaves and radio waves), the quantum energy
is too low to drive chemical reactions.
Microbial and plant photosynthesis generates biomass,
which is catabolized by consumers and decomposers. The
consumers store a small fraction of their energy in biomass.
At each successive level, the majority of energy is lost, radiated from Earth as heat. Thus, despite the growth of living
organisms on Earth, the universe as a whole becomes more
disordered. The complex roles of microbial metabolism in
global ecosystems are discussed in Chapters 21 and 22.

Note:

The principles of energy change, discussed next, apply
to all the reactions of Table 13.1. These reactions are covered in
detail in Chapters 13 and 14.

from Earth as heat.

Gibbs Free Energy Change

From Table 13.1 we see that microbes can harness an
enormous variety of chemical reactions for growth. But
what determines whether a given reaction can support life?
Gibbs free energy change (ΔG). To provide energy to a cell,
a biochemical reaction must go forward from reactants to
products. The direction of a reaction can be predicted by a
thermodynamic quantity known as the Gibbs free energy

Solar radiation

■

ΔH = change in enthalpy, the heat energy absorbed
or released as reactants become products at constant
pressure. When reactants absorb heat from their
surroundings as they convert to products, ΔH is positive.
When, instead, heat energy is released,
ΔH is negative. Release of heat (negative
value of ΔH) can yield energy for the cell
to use. An example of a reaction with
negative ΔH is the oxidation of glucose
by O2.

change, ΔG (also known as free energy change or Gibbs
energy change). The ΔG value of a reaction determines how
much energy is potentially available to do work, such as to
drive rotary flagella, to build a cell wall, or to store accurate
information in DNA. The sign of the free energy change,
ΔG, determines whether a process may go forward. If ΔG is
negative, the process may go forward, whereas positive values mean that the reaction will go in reverse. The sign of
ΔG determines which “foods” a microbe can eat or, more
precisely, which reactions between available molecules can
be harnessed for microbial growth.
Under defined laboratory conditions, calculating the
ΔG value of a reaction can predict how much biomass
microbes will build (Fig. 13.5). Figure 13.5A lists various reactants for catabolic reactions performed by our gut
bacteria, and by bacteria in soil. When oxygen is available,
oxidative catabolism of sugars or of short-chain fatty acids
yields relatively large amounts of energy. Once oxygen is
used up, some bacteria can oxidize food with an alternative
electron acceptor, such as nitrate (NO3 –)—a process called
anaerobic respiration. Alternatively, bacteria can ferment
the carbon source with no mineral oxidant. Whatever the
reaction, a linear relationship appears between ΔG and the
biomass produced (Fig. 13.5B). In natural environments,
however, the changing concentrations of substrates and
products make the ΔG calculation more complicated.

ΔS = change in entropy, or disorder.
Entropy is based on the number of
states of a system, such as the number of possible conformations of a
molecule. If a cellular reaction splits
one molecule into two, all else being
equal, entropy increases; the system
is more disordered, and ΔS is positive. Most catabolic reactions have a
positive value of entropy change. A
positive value of ΔS makes ΔG more
negative and increases the potential
energy yield of a reaction.

The relationship of the free energy change ΔG with ΔH and
ΔS is given by:
ΔG = ΔH – TΔS
The overall sign of ΔG depends on its two components:
ΔH (the absorption or release of heat energy) and –TΔS [the
negative product of entropy change (ΔS) and temperature
(T)]. In living organisms, a sufficiently negative ΔH (energy
lost as heat) often overrides –TΔS, the term for increase in
order (negative value of ΔS, positive value of –TΔS). Thus,
a living organism, whose development entails increasing
order and decreasing ΔS, can grow as long as the sum of
its metabolism has a sufficiently negative value of ΔH. The
heat loss associated with ΔH is obvious in a compost pile,
where temperature rises. Similarly, all living organisms and
communities lose heat.

Note: The joule (J) is the standard SI unit to denote energy.
1 kilojoule (kJ) = 1,000 joules. Another unit commonly used is the
kilocalorie (kcal). The conversion factor is: 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal.

Enthalpy and Entropy in Metabolism

How do ΔH and –TΔS affect biochemical reactions? Each
reaction in a living cell is associated with these two types
of energy change, but to differing degrees depending on
the reaction. In general, a reaction yields energy for the
cell if:

Negative ΔG Drives a Reaction Forward

2H 2 + O2 → 2H 2O
In this reaction, two molecules of hydrogen gas donate
four electrons to oxygen, forming water. Under conditions

ΔG = ΔH – TΔS
= –572 kJ/mol – (298 K)
[–0.327 kJ/(mol · K)]
= –572 kJ/mol + 97 kJ/mol
= –475 kJ/mol

Overall, ΔG is negative, so bacteria with the appropriate enzyme pathways can use the reaction of hydrogen gas
with oxygen to provide energy.

■

An example of a thermodynamically favored reaction is
the oxidation of hydrogen gas (H2) to form water. Hydrogen is oxidized for energy by many kinds of bacteria in soil
and water (a form of lithotrophy discussed in Chapter 14).
For example, hydrogenotrophic bacteria of the genus Ralstonia have been isolated from ultrapure water used for nuclear
fuel storage, where radioactive ionization generates H2. The
chemical reaction of dissolved hydrogen and oxygen gases is:

of standard temperature (298 kelvins,
or K) and pressure (sea level), ΔH =
–572 kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol).
The ΔH is strongly negative (much
heat is released) because the bonds of
the product H 2O are much more stable
than those of the substrates H 2 and O2.
However, entropy decreases because
the three molecules are replaced by
two—a more ordered state. Thus, ΔS
is negative [ΔS = –0.327 kJ/(mol · K)].
In the Gibbs equation the negative sign
on the entropy term –TΔS makes its
contribution to ΔG positive—unfavorable for reaction. So which term wins:
ΔH or –TΔS?

■

Molecular stability increases. When reactants combine
to form products with more stable bonds, the reaction
has a negative ΔH. For example, the reaction of a sugar
with oxygen has a negative ΔH because the relatively
unstable oxygen molecules are reduced to H 2O.
Entropy increases. Reactions in which a complex molecule is broken down to a greater number of smaller
molecules increase entropy (positive ΔS, negative value
of −TΔS). An important class of such product molecules
is carboxylic acids, such as lactic acid, in which a H+ dissociates from a carboxylate ion (R–COO –). Entropy also
increases with conversion of a solid reactant to a gas,
such as CO2. For example, glucose may be fermented
to ethanol and CO2, as in the production of alcoholic
beverages.

CHAPTER 13

The relative contributions of ΔH and –TΔS are important because they determine the effect of temperature on
microbial growth. ΔH-dependent reactions such as glucose
oxidation release a lot of heat, causing, for example, the
rise in temperature of an aerated compost pile. By contrast,
the entropy component of Gibbs energy, –TΔS, does not
reflect heat loss. The magnitude of –TΔS grows larger as
temperature increases. An extreme case of entropy-driven
metabolism is that of acetate conversion to methane and
CO2, conducted by soil archaea such as Methanosarcina
barkeri. This methanogen’s growth is driven solely by the
increase in entropy (–TΔS). But the sign of ΔH is positive;
thus the organism actually absorbs heat and cools its environment. Despite the positive ΔH, the larger magnitude of
the entropy change –TΔS allows the reaction to proceed,
yielding net free energy.
How do we measure ΔG and its components, ΔH and
–TΔS? The amount of energy released by a reaction is measured in an instrument called a calorimeter. A calorimeter
may be designed to measure thermal energy (heat) released
by a reaction of pure chemicals in a test tube, or of metabolizing bacteria—or even a large farm animal (Fig. 13.6).
The cow’s thermal energy includes microbial digestion
coupled to its own digestive processes, and to its own cellular biosynthesis; what is measured is residual energy lost as
heat. In a calorimeter, the release of heat during a reaction
(or collection of reactions) maintained at constant temperature gives a measure of ΔH. Measurement conducted
at various temperatures (T) yields the temperature dependence of heat release, from which we calculate –TΔS. The
sum of the two components yields ΔG.

Energy enables cells to build ordered structures out of
simple molecules from the environment.
Cells release heat continually because transfer of
energy is never perfectly efficient.
The free energy change (ΔG) includes enthalpy (ΔH),
the heat energy absorbed or released; and –TΔS, the negative product of temperature and entropy change (ΔS).
Most reactions include both ΔH changes (such as oxidation-reduction) and ΔS changes (such as breakdown to a
larger number of products).
Negative values of ΔG show that a reaction can drive
the cell’s metabolism. The sign of ΔG depends on the
relative magnitude of ΔH and –TΔS.
ΔH-driven reactions release heat.
TΔS-driven reactions do not release heat, but they cause
a greater change in free energy (ΔG) at higher temperature.

Thought Questions

13.1 Consider glucose catabolism in your blood, where the
sugar is completely oxidized by O2 and converted to CO2:
C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O
Do you think this reaction releases greater energy as heat, or
by change in entropy? Explain.

13.2 The bacterium Lactococcus lactis was voted the official
state microbe of Wisconsin because of its importance for
cheese. During cheese production, L. lactis ferments milk
sugars to lactic acid:

Large quantities of lactic acid are formed, with relatively small
growth of bacterial biomass. Why do you think biomass is
limited? Cheese making usually runs more efficiently at high
temperature; why?

Energy in Biochemical
Reactions

For a given reaction in a given environment, many factors
determine ΔG. These factors fall into two classes—those
intrinsic to the reaction, and those dependent on the
environment:

these properties relative to arbitrary standard conditions
such as concentration and temperature.
Concentrations and environmental factors. The
direction of the reaction depends on the concentrations of reactants and products. An excess of reactants
over products makes ΔG more negative (favoring the
forward reaction), whereas an excess of product makes
ΔG more positive (favoring the reverse reaction). Reaction direction also depends on environmental factors
such as temperature, pressure, and ionic strength (salt
concentrations).

Standard Reaction Conditions

Scientists commonly present thermodynamic values under
standard conditions for temperature, pressure, and concentration. The standard conditions enable scientists to compare the intrinsic properties of reactions. The standard
Gibbs free energy change is designated ΔG°. The standard
conditions for ΔG° are as follows:
■

The temperature is 298 K (25°C).

■

The pressure is 1 atm (standard atmospheric pressure).

■

All concentrations of substrates and products are
1 molar (M).

For every chemical compound, a standard ΔG° of formation can be determined by chemical measurement. We
obtain the ΔG° for a molecular reaction under standard
conditions by summing the ΔG° values of the products, and
subtracting the sum of ΔG° values of the reactants. A table
of standard ΔG° values and a sample calculation are provided in Appendix 1.
But the ΔG° values reported in data tables hold only for
isolated reactions under “standard reaction conditions.”
Standard conditions differ greatly from the actual conditions of living cells. These conditions include temperature,
ionic strength, and gas pressure (in the case of gaseous
components, such as CO2), as well as the concentrations
of reactants and products. To account for some differences,
biochemists add special standard conditions: the hydrogen
ion concentration at pH 7, because living cells commonly
maintain their cytoplasm within a unit of neutral pH; and
the water concentration of 55.5 M for dilute solutions. The
free energy change in biochemistry is thus designated ΔG°′.
The additivity of energy change is central to all living
metabolism. Additivity makes it possible to do work by
coupling an energy-yielding reaction to an energy-spending
reaction (see Section 13.3). Figure 13.7 shows an example,
the initial reaction of glycolysis (see Section 13.5), in which
ATP phosphorylates glucose to glucose 6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme hexokinase. In this reaction, the loss
of a phosphoryl group from ATP yields energy, some of

ATP equals the sum of the values for the two coupled reactions:
phosphorylation of glucose (ΔG1°′) and ATP hydrolysis (ΔG2°′).

which is captured by the enzyme to transfer the phosphoryl
group onto glucose. The reactions and their ΔG°′ values are
summed as follows:
Phosphorylation of glucose
C6H12O6 + H 2PO4 – → C6H12O6 – PO3 – + H 2O
ΔG1°′ = +13.8 kJ/mol
ATP hydrolysis
ATP + H 2O → ADP + H 2PO4 – + H+
ΔG2°′ = –30.5 kJ/mol
ATP phosphorylation of glucose
C6H12O6 + ATP → C6H12O6 – PO3 – + ADP + H+
ΔG3°′ = –16.7 kJ/mol

Note:

Distinguish these forms of the Gibbs free energy term:

ΔG = change in Gibbs free energy for a reaction under defined
conditions.
ΔG° = ΔG at standard conditions of temperature (298 K) and pressure (1 atm, sea level), with all reactants and products at a
concentration of 1 M. (Table of values in Appendix 1.)
ΔG°′ = ΔG at standard temperature, pressure, and concentrations
for ΔG°, plus the biochemically relevant conditions of pH 7
(H+ concentration of 10–7 M) and water (H2O concentration of
55.5 M; activity = 1). Some biochemists standardize additional
factors, such as magnesium ion concentration ([Mg2+] = 1 mM).

Concentrations of Reactants
and Products

In living cells, the concentrations of reactants and products
usually differ from 1 M; for example, in the E. coli cytoplasm,

CHAPTER 13

the concentrations of ATP and Pi are about 8 mM. Thus, the
actual ΔG of reactions within a cell differs from ΔG° or ΔG°′.
Consider a reaction in which reactants A and B are
reversibly converted to products C and D:
A+B

C+D

Higher concentration of reactants (A or B) drives the reaction forward, whereas higher concentration of products
drives it in reverse. So, ΔG includes the ratio of products
to reactants:
[C][D]
ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln
[A][B]
[C][D]
= ΔG° + 2.303RT log
[A][B]
where R is the gas constant [R = 8.315 × 10 –3 kJ/(mol ·
K)] and T is the absolute temperature in kelvins (298 K,
or 25°C). The factor 2.303 converts the logarithm of the
ratio of products to reactants from base e (ln) to base 10
(log). Note that in ΔG°′ calculations, the water “activity”
(concentration modified by a constant) is set at 1. The logarithm of 1 equals zero, so the water activity falls out of the
equation.
Table 13.2 shows how the concentration ratio affects ΔG.
In reactions at medium temperature (25°C–40°C), a 100fold increase in the ratio of products to reactants adds about
11 kJ/mol to ΔG. ΔG is then less negative and the reaction
less favorable. On the other hand, a 100-fold decrease in the
concentration ratio makes ΔG more negative by –11 kJ/mol.
In some environments, a highly negative concentration term can override a positive ΔG°, resulting in a reaction with negative ΔG that microbes can use for energy.
For example, in an iron mine the high concentration of
reduced iron favors iron-oxidizing microbes. Alternatively,
a high temperature may increase the magnitude of the term
2.303RT log [products]/[reactants] when it is negative,

until it overrides a positive ΔG°. This temperature dependence of ΔG is observed in thermophiles such as Sulfolobus,
which metabolizes sulfur at 90°C; these sulfur reactions
could not go forward at lower temperatures.
Another way the direction of reaction may change is
for a second metabolic process to remove one of the reaction’s products (C or D) as fast as it is produced. The
decrease in product concentration could then change the
ΔG of the first reaction to a negative value. For example,
when our intestinal bacteria break down glucose to pyruvate (see Section 13.5), many of the individual reactions
have ΔG°′ values smaller than 5 kJ/mol. Their actual direction of reaction in the cell depends on concentrations of
products and reactants. Glycolytic reactions with near-zero
ΔG°′ are reversible and can, in fact, participate in the biosynthetic pathway of gluconeogenesis (glucose biosynthesis, discussed in Chapter 15).
A surprising discovery has been that many bacteria and archaea in natural environments grow extremely
slowly, using energy-yielding metabolism with values of
ΔG approaching zero (that is, near thermodynamic equilibrium). When the actual ΔG (under actual reaction conditions) equals zero, a reaction proceeds equally forward and
in reverse, and there is no net change in energy. At equilibrium, the ratio of product and reactant concentrations
exactly cancels ΔG° or ΔG°′:
ΔG = 0 = ΔG° + 2.303RT log
ΔG° = – 2.303RT log

[C][D]
[A][B]

[C][D]
[A][B]

Living cells can never grow exactly at equilibrium
(ΔG = 0). But most soil bacteria and archaea gain energy from
anaerobic metabolism with near-zero values of ΔG. Such
organisms must form biomass very slowly, but if no other
metabolism is available, they may outgrow competitors. The
discovery of low-ΔG energetics has opened new possibilities
for environmental remediation previously thought impossible, such as the anaerobic digestion of complex organic pollutants in contaminated soil (see Section 13.6).
Some of the near-zero anaerobic pathways involve syntrophy, an intimate metabolic relationship between two species. Jessica Sieber at the University of Illinois and Michael
McInerney at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, show
how syntrophy works for microbes that break down pollutants (Special Topic 13.1). For syntrophy, a bacterium catabolizes reactants by a reaction that has a positive ΔG°′ value,
while H 2-oxidizing organisms such as methanogens complete the reaction with a net negative ΔG°′. The bacterial
catabolism provides H 2 gas, which the partner species consumes, thus keeping H 2 concentration low enough to drive
the syntrophic reaction. Analogous partnerships may link
many catabolic reactions of gut bacteria (see Chapter 21).

SPECIAL TOPIC 13.1, , Microbial Syntrophy Cleans Up Oil

NEIL WOFFORD, UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA

Have you ever wondered how to clean up polluted soil and
water? Michael McInerney at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, thinks about cleanup from the point of view of microbial energetics (Fig. 1). As the son of a wastewater treatment
engineer in Chicago, he learned early on about pollution in the
Great Lakes. Later, in Oklahoma, he realized that there was
a growing problem of water supplies contaminated by sewage and waste petroleum. He began to study how microbes
catabolize sewage components, such as the short-chain acids

FIGURE 1 ■ Jessica Sieber at the University of Illinois

University of Oklahoma, Norman.

propionate and butyrate, and aromatic oil compounds such as
benzoate.
A fundamental challenge to degrading these pollutants is
the lack of oxygen. The molecules seep into the depths of soil
or water, where any oxygen is quickly used up by microbes
capable of respiration. Jessica Sieber, as a postdoctoral fellow, took up the challenge of elucidating anaerobic pathways
to degrade aromatics. Since her move to the University of Illinois, Sieber has kept her focus on anaerobic life, tweeting as
@SyntrophySieber, “I tune out when O2 is mentioned!”
As microbes use up the long-chain components of sewage
or oil, the remaining short-chain molecules and aromatic rings
can be broken down only by transferring leftover electrons
onto hydrogen ions, forming H2. For example, Syntrophus aciditrophicus and Syntrophomonas wolfei catabolize benzoate
into acetate and bicarbonate ions, releasing H2 (Table 1).
But the H2-releasing reactions of Syntrophus and Syntrophomonas have a positive value of ΔG° (see Table 1), and thus
they cannot go forward to yield energy. So how can these
bacteria obtain energy? The ΔG can be shifted by rapidly
removing H2 gas, thus lowering the concentration of this key
product. Once the equations are balanced, negative values of
ΔG are obtained. H2 can be removed by other microbes that
oxidize hydrogen using alternative electron acceptors such
as bicarbonate (the archaeal methanogen Methanospirillum),
sulfate or nitrate (the bacterium Desulfovibrio) (Fig. 2A).
Hydrogen-producing bacteria have evolved to grow in
close proximity to the hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria or archaea.

within a wastewater sludge granule, where anaerobic catabolism must degrade sewage components to CO2. The granule
is stained with fluorescent markers for the H2-producing bacteria (red) and their partner methanogen (yellow). In order for
the syntrophy to proceed, the H2 from the catabolizing bacteria must be transferred quickly to the methanogenic partner,
by processes that are not yet understood. Genomic analysis of
Syntrophus aciditrophicus reveals genes for flagellar motility,
suggesting that flagellar motility helps the cell find its partner
in order to form an association. Microscopy reveals intercellular nanotubes that may transmit electrons from the H2 producer to the partner.
Under laboratory conditions, Sieber and McInerney demonstrated syntrophic growth in the presence of defined
concentrations of reactants and products (Table 1). Their calculations showed that cells grew with negative values of free
energy change. Yet even in the presence of the syntrophic
partner, these anaerobic pathways have free energy changes
that are remarkably low (about –20 kJ/mol), often below
the theoretical minimum required to generate ATP (about
–60 kJ/mol). Such extremely low energy levels require
special arrangements called “reverse electron transport,” in
which electrons are transferred from one carrier to the next,
despite a positive ΔG value (requiring energy input). The elec-

tron transfer must be coupled with a compensating reaction
that spends enough energy to yield a net negative ΔG.
Syntrophic partnerships are considered “thermodynamic
extremophiles” because they grow at such low ΔG values.
Nonetheless, these organisms are of global importance
because they play an essential role in recycling the smallmolecule products of anaerobic catabolism. Furthermore,
they present exciting industrial applications. For instance,
the methanogenic partnership between H2-producing bacteria and Methanococcus maripaludis might be used to attack
unextractable oil residues and convert the carbon into methane for recovery as natural gas. Other syntrophic interactions
may be used to increase the efficiency of sewage mineralization during water treatment.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Thought Question

A. Diffusion: positive ∆S

13.3 The thermophilic bacteria Thermus species grow
in deep-sea hydrothermal vents at 80°C. It was proposed that they metabolize formate to bicarbonate ion
and hydrogen gas:
HCOO – + H2O → HCO3– + H2
But the standard ΔG°′ is near zero (–2.6 kJ/mol). Under
actual conditions, do you think the reaction yields
energy? Assume concentrations of 150 mM formate,
20 mM bicarbonate ion, and 10 mM hydrogen gas.

Concentration Gradients

B. Transmembrane gradient

So far, our discussion of energy has assumed an isotropic system, in which concentrations are the same
everywhere. But a living cell needs to obtain its molecules from outside, such as sugars, amino acids, and
inorganic ions (discussed in Chapter 4). Suppose a
blood pathogen needs to obtain a scarce substance
such as iron (Fe2+). How does the microbe move the
iron “uphill” against its concentration gradient?
A substance dissolved in water diffuses by random
movements until its distribution has the same concentration throughout (Fig. 13.8A). The random
distribution of molecules at uniform concentration
represents the state of greatest entropy. Diffusion in the
environment ultimately brings nutrients into contact with
microbial cells, even cells that lack chemotactic motility to
hunt for food. For example, sugars in the food we eat diffuse through our saliva to reach the bacteria growing in
biofilms on our teeth.
The cell membrane contains transporters for useful
molecules, allowing nutrient molecules to cross. Entropy
favors their movement from higher to lower concentration
(Fig. 13.8B). In most environments, however, the nutrients are at lower concentrations than inside the cell. To
obtain these molecules from outside, the bacterial cell must
transport them against their gradient—that is, from lower
to higher concentration—increasing the concentration difference and thus decreasing entropy. Uptake against a concentration gradient requires an energy source to power
transport proteins embedded in the membrane (as shown
in Chapter 4). Alternatively, a transmembrane gradient of
ions can store energy for the cell. The most important ion
gradient is the H+ gradient, a component of the proton
motive force (to be explained in Chapter 14).

Energy is required
to move molecules
up the gradient.

■

Concentrations of reactants and products affect the
actual value of ΔG. The lower the concentration ratio of
products to reactants, the more negative the value of ΔG.
Environmental factors such as temperature and pressure
also affect ΔG.
Within living cells, energy-yielding reactions are coupled with energy-spending reactions. The measurement of energy flow under changing conditions requires
calculations more complex than those shown here.
A concentration gradient stores energy. Solutes run
down their concentration gradient unless energy is
applied to reverse the flow. Gradient energy can be interconverted with energy from chemical reactions.

CHAPTER 13

13.3

Energy Carriers and
Electron Transfer

Our ΔG equations show only the total energy of a reaction
such as glucose oxidation. If all the energy were released
at once, however, it would dissipate as heat without building biomass. In living cells, glucose is never oxidized in
one step. Instead, the energy yield is divided among a large
number of stepwise reactions with smaller energy changes.
In this way, the cell can be thought of as “making change”
by converting a large energy source to numerous smaller
sources that can be “spent” conveniently for cell function
and biosynthesis. The “spending” of energy is controlled
by enzymes that couple all of the energy-providing reactions to specific energy-spending reactions.

Energy Carriers Gain and
Release Energy

Many of the cell’s energy transfer reactions involve energy
carriers. Examples of energy carriers are ATP (adenosine
triphosphate) and NADH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Energy carriers are molecules
that gain and release small amounts of energy in reversible
reactions. Energy carriers are used to transfer energy in a
wide range of biochemical reactions.

■

ENERGETICS AND CATABOLISM

■

489

Some energy carriers, such as NADH, transfer energy
associated with electrons received from a food molecule. A
molecule that transfers, or “donates,” electrons to another
molecule is called an electron donor or a reducing agent;
a molecule that receives, or “accepts,” electrons is called
an electron acceptor. For example, during glucose catabolism a molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate transfers a pair of electrons (2e –) with a hydrogen ion (H+) to
NAD+, forming NADH. NAD+ is an electron acceptor that
receives the electrons; it then becomes the electron donor
NADH. Electron donors such as NADH transfer electrons
from reduced food molecules to a terminal electron acceptor such as oxygen (see Chapter 14). Energy carriers that
transfer electrons are needed for all energy-yielding pathways and for biosynthesis of cell components such as amino
acids and lipids (see Chapter 15).
Note that in living cells, all energy transfer reactions
are coupled by enzymes to specific biochemical processes.
Without enzyme coupling, energy dissipates and would be
lost from the living system.

ATP Carries Energy

Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP (Fig. 13.9A), is composed of a base (adenine), a sugar (ribose), and three
phosphoryl groups. Note that adenine-ribose-phosphate

one that forms spontaneously from methane and ammonia
in experiments simulating the origin of life on early Earth
(discussed in Chapters 1 and 17). Like the sugar ribose,
ATP is an ancient component of cells, found in all living
organisms.
Under physiological conditions, ATP always forms a
complex with Mg2+ (Fig. 13.9B). The magnesium cation
partly neutralizes the negative charges of the ATP phosphates, stabilizing the structure in solution. Most enzymebinding sites for ATP actually bind Mg2+-ATP. This is one
reason why magnesium is an essential nutrient for all living
cells.

ATP is a “medium-sized” energy carrier, since the
cell contains many phosphorylated molecules that yield
greater energy upon hydrolysis. Table 13.3 summarizes
examples of free energy change associated with hydrolysis
of various phosphoryl groups. As we will see, phosphoryl
group hydrolysis with ΔG°′ values larger than –31 kJ/mol
can yield energy that is stored by ATP formation. ATP

The phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP requires energy
input (positive ΔG).
Why does ATP formation require energy? The inorganic phosphate molecule has four oxygen atoms that
share a negative charge. When phosphate reacts with
another phosphate to form a bond, the charged oxygens
of adjacent phosphates are forced to interact despite charge
repulsion. The charge repulsion in ATP limits rotation of
oxygens, and thus decreases entropy, which results in a
negative ΔG of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of each phosphoryl
group yields energy. The formation and hydrolysis of ATP
can be shown as:

Glucose 6-P + H2O → glucose + Pi

Reaction of hydrolysis

■

Hydrolysis releasing phosphate. The hydrolysis of
ATP at the terminal phosphate consumes H 2O to produce ADP and Pi, releasing energy. The energy released
by ATP hydrolysis can be transferred to a coupled reaction of biosynthesis, such as building an amino acid. The
two reactions are coupled by an enzyme with binding
sites specific for ATP and the substrate.
Hydrolysis releasing pyrophosphate. ATP can hydrolyze at the middle phosphate, releasing pyrophosphate
(PPi). The pyrophosphate usually hydrolyzes shortly
afterward to make 2 Pi. Overall, the release of 2 Pi from
ATP yields approximately twice as much energy as the
release of 1 Pi. Pyrophosphate release and subsequent
hydrolysis drives a reaction strongly forward, because
twice as much energy would be required to reverse the
reaction. Pyrophosphate is released in reactions that
must avoid reversal—for example, the incorporation of
nucleotides into growing chains of RNA.
Phosphorylation of an organic molecule. ATP can
transfer its phosphate to the hydroxyl group of a molecule such as glucose to activate the substrate for a subsequent rapid reaction. No inorganic phosphate appears,
and no water molecule is consumed:
ATP + glucose → ADP + glucose 6-P

Some enzymes catalyze ATP transfer of phosphate to
activate sugar molecules for catabolism. Other enzymes

CHAPTER 13

couple the phosphorylation of a sugar to its transport across
the cell membrane; consequently, these enzymes make up
the phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS enzymes
play a critical role in determining which nutrients from the
environment some microbes can acquire and catabolize
(discussed in Chapter 4).

Note that, besides ATP, other nucleotides carry energy.
Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) provides energy for ribosome elongation of proteins. And the phosphodiester
bonds of all four nucleotide triphosphates, as well as their
corresponding deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, carry
energy for their own incorporation into RNA and DNA,
respectively.

Thought Questions

13.4 When ATP phosphorylates glucose to glucose
6-phosphate, what is the net value of ΔG°? What if ATP
phosphorylates pyruvate? Can this latter reaction go forward
without additional input of energy? (See Table 13.3.)
13.5 Linking an amino acid to its cognate tRNA is driven by
ATP hydrolysis to AMP (adenosine monophosphate) plus pyrophosphate. Why release PPi instead of Pi?
ATP produced by glucose catabolism. A large number of

ATPs can be formed by coupling ATP synthesis to the
step-by-step breakdown and oxidation of a food molecule
such as glucose. In theory, complete oxidation of glucose
through respiration can produce as many as 38 ATP molecules. The overall ΔG°′ of the coupled reactions is:
C6H12O6 + 6H 2O + 6O2 →
12H 2O + 6CO2

ΔG°′ = –2,878 kJ/mol

38[ADP + Pi → ATP + H 2O]

ΔG°′ = 38 × (+31 kJ/mol)

Net ΔG°′ = –1,700 kJ/mol
The difference in ΔG°′ for the coupled reactions is the energy
lost as heat and entropy—in this case, –1,700 kJ/mol
(–2,878 kJ/mol + 1,178 kJ/mol). Thus, the maximal efficiency of energy capture by ATP is about 40%, a level that
may be approached by highly efficient systems such as
mitochondria. When ΔG values are corrected for cellular
concentrations of reactants and products, the actual efficiency may be greater than 50%. Under conditions such as
low oxygen concentration, much smaller amounts of ATP
are made per molecule of glucose. For comparison, the efficiency of a typical machine, such as an internal combustion
engine, is about 20%.
Thought Question

13.6 In the microbial community of the bovine rumen, the
actual ΔG value has been calculated for glucose fermentation
to acetate:
C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2C2H3O2– + 2H+ + 4H2 + 2CO2
ΔG = –318 kJ/mol
If the actual ΔG for ATP formation is +44 kJ/mol and each
glucose fermentation yields four molecules of ATP, what is the
thermodynamic efficiency of energy gain? Where does the
lost energy go?

NADH Carries Energy and Electrons

Another major energy carrier is nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide, or NAD (NADH, reduced; NAD+, oxidized). Unlike ATP, NADH carries energy associated with
two electrons that reduce a substrate (Fig. 13.10). NADH
carries two or three times as much energy as ATP, depending on cell conditions. During sugar catabolism, NADH
carries electrons from breakdown products of glucose. Its
oxidized form, NAD+, receives two electrons (2e –) plus a
hydrogen ion (H+) from a food molecule; a second H+ from
the food molecule enters the solution. Overall, reduction
of NAD+ consumes two hydrogen atoms to make NADH:
NAD+ + 2H+ + 2e – → NADH + H+

ΔG°′ = +62 kJ/mol

For this reaction, ΔG°′ is positive; therefore, it requires
input of energy from the catabolism of the food molecule.
The reduced energy carrier NADH can then reverse this
reaction by donating two electrons (2e –) to another molecule, regenerating NAD+.

Note:

A hydrogen ion, or “proton” (H+), does not exist free in
solution. In water, a H+ combines with H2O to form a hydronium ion
(H3O+), but for clarity we use H+. An atom of hydrogen removed
from a C–H bond consists of a proton (H+) plus an electron (e–). In
a reaction, the proton and electron may be transferred to one molecule or to separate molecules.

NADH structure and function. NAD+ consists of an ADP

molecule attached to nicotinamide instead of a third phosphate. The nicotinamide mononucleotide, like a ribonucleotide, contains a nitrogenous base attached to a sugar
phosphate. In NAD+, the nicotinamide has a ring structure (shaded orange in Fig. 13.10A) that forms a stable
cation.
NAD+ is a relatively stable structure because the ring
electrons are aromatic; that is, the bonding electrons delocalize around the ring, as in benzene. Aromatic rings that
contain noncarbon atoms are said to be heteroaromatic.
Many biologically active molecules are heteroaromatic,
including adenine and other nucleotide bases. A heteroaromatic ring is stable, but its disruption requires less energy
than the disruption of benzene. Thus, it is possible to disrupt the ring by adding two electrons with H+ eliminating
one double bond. The donation of electrons eliminates the

The electrons transferred to NADH eventually must

NADH builds up in a cell, no NAD+ remains to continue

ΔG°′ = –220 kJ/mol

Thus, the total energy released during NADH oxidation
through the ETS is –220 kJ/mol (–62 kJ/mol – 158 kJ/mol).
This energy is converted to transmembrane proton potential (composed of the H+ concentration difference plus the
charge difference across the membrane). The proton potential (see Chapter 14) drives nutrient transport, motility, and
synthesis of ATP.

Note:

Reduction potentials, electron transport, and proton
motive force are discussed further in Chapter 14.

Other energy carriers that transfer electrons. Different
steps of metabolism utilize different but related energy carriers. For example, NADPH differs from NADH only in
its extra phosphate attached to the 2′ carbon of adenine
nucleotide; the amount of energy carried is the same. Some
enzymes can utilize both NADPH and NADH, whereas
other enzymes use only one or the other.

Another related energy carrier is flavin adenine dinucleotide, or FAD (FADH 2, reduced; FAD, oxidized), in
which flavin substitutes for nicotinamide. The flavin nucleotide includes a ring structure whose aromaticity is eliminated by its receiving two electrons (Fig. 13.10B). The
redox function of the flavin isoalloxazine ring system is
similar to that of NADH:
FAD + 2H+ + 2e – → FADH 2
Like NADH, FADH 2 donates 2e – to an electron acceptor.
FADH 2 is a weaker electron donor than NADH, but when
FADH 2 is combined with a strong electron acceptor such
as O2, electrons are transferred and significant energy is
released:
ΔG°′ = –42 – 158 = –200 kJ/mol
Why do different kinds of reactions use different energy
carriers?
■

■

Different redox levels. Food molecules may have more
or fewer electrons (level of reduction/oxidation) than
those associated with the cell structure. For example,
lipids are more highly reduced than glucose. Thus, lipid
catabolism requires a greater proportion of electronaccepting energy carriers (such as NAD+ or NADP+)
than does glucose catabolism, and it makes relatively few
ATP molecules directly. A combination of energy carriers with different redox states enables cells to balance
their overall redox potential while transferring energy.
Different amounts of energy. Biochemical reactions
yield different amounts of energy—that is, different
values of ΔG. Suppose a reaction can provide more than
enough energy to generate ATP from ADP (31 kJ),
but not quite enough to generate NADH from NAD+
(62 kJ). An example is the conversion of succinate to
fumarate in the TCA cycle (see Section 13.6). Succinate

conversion provides the energy to reduce FAD to
FADH 2, whose oxidation by O2 can yield two molecules
of ATP. Thus, the use of FADH 2 enables the cell to
make more efficient use of its food than if generation of
ATP or NADH were the only choices.
■

Regulation and specificity. Specific energy carriers can
direct metabolites into different pathways serving different functions. For example, in many bacteria NADH is
directed into the ETS, whereas NADPH, the 2′-phosphorylated form of NADH, is directed into biosynthesis
of cell components such as amino acids and lipids.

The concentrations and reduction level of energy carriers provide much information on the state of a cell, such
as the effects of environmental stress on cell metabolism.
But energy carriers such as NADH undergo rapid turnover
(interconversion with NAD+). How can we observe NADH
and ATP concentrations within living cells? One method
uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (discussed in eTopic 13.1). The use of NMR to observe living
cells led to the development of magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to observe the entire human body.

Enzymes Catalyze Metabolic Reactions

In living cells, each reaction must occur only as needed, in
the right amount at the right time. The rate of a reaction is
determined by the activation energy (E a), the input energy
needed to generate the high-energy transition state on
the way to products (Fig. 13.11). Most biochemical reactions require an activation energy that exceeds the average
kinetic energy of the reactant molecules colliding. Thus, no
matter how negative the ΔG, the reaction will proceed at a
significant rate only when the activation energy is lowered
by interaction with a catalyst, an agent that participates in a
reaction without being consumed.

FIGURE 13.11 ■ Enzymes lower the activation energy of the
transition state. In the presence of an enzyme, the activation
energy of the reaction is decreased, allowing rapid conversion of
reactants to products.

Biological reactions are catalyzed by enzymes, structures composed of protein (or, in some cases, RNA) that
bind substrates of a specific reaction. The enzyme lowers
the activation energy by bringing the substrates in proximity to one another and by correctly orienting them to
react. In some cases, enzymes provide a reactive amino acid
residue to participate in a transition state between reactants
and products. Microbial enzymes have growing importance in industry; they are used for food production, fabric
treatment, and drug therapies (discussed in Chapter 16).
Enzymes couple specific energy-yielding reactions
(such as those of glucose breakdown) with the cell’s reactions requiring energy, such as making ATP. An example
of coupled reactions is shown in Figure 13.12. The substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a phosphorylated breakdown product of glucose, is converted to pyruvate while
the phosphate is added to ADP to generate ATP:

The ΔG°′ of phosphate cleavage from PEP is –62 kJ/
mol, whereas the ΔG°′ of ATP formation is only +31 kJ/
mol. Thus, the net ΔG°′ is negative (–31 kJ/mol), and the
reaction goes forward to pyruvate. But a high activation
energy makes the reaction extremely slow; without help,
it rarely goes forward on the timescale of life. The reaction proceeds only when the two reacting substrates (PEP
and ADP) are coupled by the enzyme pyruvate kinase (Fig.
13.12A). Pyruvate kinase has specific binding sites for each
of its substrates: PEP and ADP. ADP and PEP are brought
together by the enzyme and positioned so as to lower the
activation energy of phosphate transfer.
In addition to the catalytic site, the enzyme has an
allosteric site (a regulatory site distinct from the substratebinding site) for its activator, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
The difference between a substrate-binding site and an
allosteric site can be seen in the molecular model based on
X-ray crystallography (Fig. 13.12B). The allosteric site is
found at a distance from the substrate-binding site, but its
interaction with the regulator, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate,
alters the conformation of the entire enzyme, increasing the
rate of reaction. As we will see, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
is a central intermediate of glycolysis; thus, it makes sense
that as this molecule builds up, it activates pyruvate kinase
to remove products farther down the chain of catabolic
reactions, maintaining the steady flow of metabolites.
Thought Question

13.7 What would happen to the cell if pyruvate kinase

catalyzed PEP conversion to pyruvate but failed to couple this
reaction to ATP production?

Note that pyruvate kinase is actually named for its
reverse reaction: pyruvate phosphorylation to PEP. The
enzyme may have been named for activity that was originally observed in the reverse direction, before the cell function was understood. Enzymes can catalyze both forward
and reverse reactions. The predominant direction of catalysis depends on the concentrations of substrates and products (which determine ΔG) and on allosteric regulators.

13.4

Catabolism: The
Microbial Buffet

In the early twentieth century, it was thought that microbes
could catabolize a limited subset of naturally occurring
organic molecules, such as sugars. Molecules not known
to be catabolized were termed “xenobiotics,” especially
if they were “synthetic” products of human industry. We
have since found that virtually any organic molecule can
be catabolized by a microbe that has evolved the appropriate enzymes. Catabolism by microbes in our own digestive
system helps us digest complex food molecules. Catabolism
also plays key roles in microbial disease; for example, the
causative agent of acne, Propionibacterium acnes, degrades
skin cell components such as lipids.

Note:

The allosteric regulator
changes the enzyme
conformation to allow
substrate binding.

Besides releasing energy, the breakdown of organic
food molecules provides substrates for biosynthesis. Biosynthesis
is covered in Chapter 15.

Substrates for Catabolism

Here we present several important classes of catabolic
substrates (Fig. 13.13). While in principle virtually any
organic constituent may be catabolized, certain kinds of
substrates are used more rapidly because they require less
activation energy or fewer types of enzymes to break them
down. Many of these substrates form products important
to our nutrition and technology. Others, such as aromatic
components of petroleum, are environmental pollutants
that only bacteria and fungi can degrade (see Section 13.6).
Carbohydrates. Carbohydrates (sugars and sugar poly-

mers, or polysaccharides) (Fig. 13.13A), are important as
structural components of cells, and for their central role
in human digestion. Microbial catabolism is central to our
production of food and drink (presented in Chapter 16).
Glucose as such is rarely available to microbes, except to
pathogens growing within a host. But the pathways of glucose catabolism complete the digestion of a diverse range
of food molecules found in the environment. The main
carbohydrates digested by human enzymes are starches,
glucose polymers in which an acetal (O–COH) condenses
with a hydroxyl group, releasing H 2O.
But intestinal bacteria such as Bacteroides species can
digest a far greater range of polysaccharides, such as the
cellulose of plant cell walls and the pectin of fruit. Such

polysaccharides were originally defined as “fiber”—that is,
polymers indigestible by humans. We now know that partial digestion of fiber contributes significant caloric content
to the human diet. Members of the gut microbiome are so
important that human breast milk contains specific types
of carbohydrates to feed them.
Plant-derived polysaccharides are long molecules that
cannot be taken up by cells. Instead, microbes secrete
enzymes that initiate extracellular digestion (see Fig. 13.1).
Sugar chains are broken down by microbial enzymes,
first to short chains (oligosaccharides), then to two-sugar
units (disaccharides), and then to monosaccharides such

as glucose or fructose. In some sugars, the aldehyde is
replaced by a hydroxyl (sorbitol, mannitol) or a carboxylate
(gluconate, glucuronate). Polysaccharides are hydrolyzed to
products that enter central catabolic pathways such as glycolysis (Fig. 13.14).
Lipids. Many bacteria catabolize lipids (Fig. 13.13B)

from sources such as milk, animal fats, and nuts. The
oxidation of lipid catabolites causes the rancid odor of
spoiled meat or butter (issues of food microbiology,
discussed in Chapter 16). Microbes catabolize lipids
by hydrolysis to glycerol and fatty acids (Fig. 13.14).

■ Many carbon sources enter central pathways of catabolism.
Carbohydrates are broken down by specific
enzymes to disaccharides and then to monosaccharides such as glucose. Glucose and sugar acids are converted to pyruvate, which releases
acetyl groups. Acetyl groups or acetate are also the breakdown products of fatty acids, amino acids, and complex aromatic plant materials
such as lignin.

Glycerol, a three-carbon triol (a compound with three–OH
groups), can be considered a three-carbon sugar; it commonly enters catabolism as an intermediate of glycolysis. Alternatively, other pathways break down glycerol to
acetate. Fatty acids, more highly reduced than glycerol,
undergo oxidative breakdown by the fatty acid degradation (FAD) pathway, forming acetyl groups. These acetyl groups enter the TCA cycle when a terminal electron
acceptor is available; alternatively, they enter fermentation
or anaerobic syntrophy.

Peptides. We commonly think of proteins as essential parts
of a cell. However, when present in excess, proteins can be
catabolized to provide energy. Initially, proteins are broken
into peptides (Fig. 13.13C) by sequence-specific proteases.
Peptides are then hydrolyzed to individual amino acids
(Fig. 13.14). Some pathogens catabolize specific amino
acids as part of the disease process. For example, Legionella
pneumophila, the cause of legionellosis, catabolizes threonine. Threonine catabolism is required for the pathogen
to grow within macrophages, a type of white blood cells.

498

■

PART 3

■

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Thus, threonine catabolism may be a target for new drugs
against L. pneumophila.
Specific enzymes catalyze the early steps in the degradation of each amino acid until products are formed that
can enter common pathways of carbohydrate catabolism
or the TCA cycle. The initial step of amino acid degradation is one of two kinds: decarboxylation (removal of CO2)
to produce an amine, or deamination (removal of NH3) to
produce a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids are degraded
through the TCA cycle. Amine products, such as cadaverine and putrescine, are often excreted, causing the noxious
odor of decomposing flesh.
Aromatic molecules. Aromatic compounds are more dif-

ficult to digest than sugars because of the exceptional
stability of aromatic ring structures. Yet many bacteria
metabolize benzene derivatives, and even polycyclic aromatic molecules, either partly or all the way to CO2. A particularly important aromatic substance found in nature is
lignin (Fig. 13.13D), which forms the key structural support of trees and woody stems. A discouragingly complex
molecule, lignin is made from six-carbon sugars converted
to benzene rings, with ether connections that are difficult
for enzymes to break down. Fungi and soil bacteria catabolize lignin to oxidized benzene derivatives such as benzoate and vanillin (Fig. 13.14). Further breakdown produces
acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle.

Today, the environment contains increasing amounts
of human-made aromatic compounds, produced for herbicides and other industrial uses, that are highly toxic pollutants. These include halogenated aromatics, such as
polychlorinated biphenyls, the source of highly toxic dioxins. Halogenated aromatics turn out to be catabolized by a
number of soil microbes, which are promising candidates
for bioremediation of polluted environments (described in
Section 13.6). Other types of aromatic molecules catabolized by microbes are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs). Found in petroleum, the multiple fused rings of
PAH compounds build up in natural environments—but
with time, microbes can catabolize them and remediate the
soil (see Section 13.6).

Products of Catabolism

What is the ultimate fate of all the bits of organic carbon
chewed up by microbial catabolism? The answer has myriad consequences for human nutrition and environmental
cycling, as well as food and industrial production. From
Table 13.1, recall two major forms of catabolism: fermentation, in which all the electrons from organic substrates
are put back onto the organic products; and respiration,
in which the electrons removed are ultimately transferred
to an inorganic electron acceptor such as oxygen or nitrate
(anaerobic respiration). In a third case, photoheterotrophy,

Respiration. Respiration combines catabolic breakdown

of organic molecules with electron transfer to a terminal
electron acceptor such as oxygen. Respiration yields far
more energy from catabolism than does fermentation. For
humans, respiration is synonymous with breathing; but in
the absence of O2, many microbes use alternative electron
acceptors such as nitrate (see Chapter 14).

Catabolism: Molecular and Cell Biology

In natural ecosystems, how do cells manage to break down
complex carbon sources? Free-living bacteria and fungi
may catabolize thousands of different carbon sources,
each requiring specific transporters and enzymes for initial breakdown. Most of these, particularly complex plant
constituents, are not digestible by animals, whose genomes
fail to encode the necessary enzymes. The only polysaccharides that human enzymes can digest are starch, lactose,
and sucrose. Yet human breast milk includes a mixture of
complex milk oligosaccharides, including branched chains
of N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, and fucose. Amazingly,
our own breast milk has evolved to support bacteria with
specific catabolic abilities to colonize the infant gut.
It is well known that animals such as cattle require
microbes living within their digestive tracts to ferment cellulose from grasses or wood. We now know that humans,
too, require related bacteria to digest a variety of plantderived fibers. For example, both cattle and humans contain
anaerobes of the Gram-negative genus Bacteroides and the
Gram-positive genus Ruminococcus (originally named for
the bovine rumen). By evolving a symbiosis with microbes,
animals avoid the need to acquire new catabolic genes in
their own genome. The microbial genomes are functionally part of the human metagenome, the total sequence of
genomes of a community of organisms.
The genome sequence of our microbiome determines our
ability to digest common foods such as lettuce and tomatoes (Fig. 13.15). The major polysaccharide fibers of these

and tomato fibers are digested in our microbiome.
Each type of xyloglucan requires a slightly different set
of genes, called a polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL).
The PULs evolved from a common ancestral starch utilization system (SUS). Most gut bacteria possess a number
of PULs distributed around their genomes, showing evidence of horizontal gene transfer and evolution of genomic
islands (discussed in Chapter 9). Figure 13.16A shows
the xyloglucan PUL for each of four different species of
Bacteroides found in the human gut. The DNA sequences
of these species show synteny—that is, sufficient similarity

sans air (“life without air”), fermentation is the partial
breakdown of organic food without net transfer of electrons
to an inorganic terminal electron acceptor. Thus, food ferments without oxygen. Fermentation has a negative ΔG,
owing to breakdown of a large molecule to several smaller
products, which are usually more stable as well. Examples
of fermentation pathways include ethanolic fermentation
producing alcoholic beverages, and lactate fermentation by
lactic acid bacteria producing cheese and yogurt. (We will
discuss more examples; also see Table 13.5).

of sequence and map position to predict common ancestry
(discussed in Chapter 17). Surprisingly, only a small minority of our gut microbiome possesses the ability to digest
xyloglucans. Thus, the caloric content we receive from lettuce and tomatoes depends on just a few key members of
our gut community.
How do our gut bacteria actually handle complex food
sources such as xyloglucans? Since bacteria have solid cell
walls and are incapable of phagocytosis, a bacterium cannot
take up a large food particle, but it can secrete enzymes or
place enzymes on the outer membrane to break down the

fibers into short oligosaccharides (Fig. 13.16B). The PUL
genes encode outer membrane–inserted enzymes (GH5A
and GH9A in Fig. 13.16B) that specifically cleave xyloglucans. Other genes encode oligosaccharide outer membrane
transporters (SusC and SusC-related proteins). Within the
periplasm, various amylases break down the oligosaccharides to monosaccharides. The monosaccharide products
are then transported across the inner membrane into the
cytoplasm, where they undergo glycolysis (discussed in the
next section). Metagenome analysis reveals hundreds of
Sus homologs, called Sus-like systems, that target different

CHAPTER 13

polysaccharides; these comprise, for example, 18% of the
genome of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
In a complex environment, with numerous potential
substrates for catabolism, how does a given microbe decide
what to eat first? Organisms select substrates on the basis
of their availability and energy efficiency. Substrate selection involves gene regulation, as discussed in Chapter 10.
For example, in E. coli the sugar lactose induces transcription of genes that encode beta-galactosidase (lacZ) and
lactose permease (lacY). But in the presence of glucose, a
preferred carbon source, lac transcription is halted. Halting lac transcription enables preferential catabolism of
glucose. The process of prioritized consumption of substrates is known as catabolite repression (presented in
Chapter 10).
As we saw in Figure 13.14, the products of catabolism of many diverse substrates ultimately funnel into a
few common pathways of metabolism. The remainder of
this chapter presents key pathways in detail: glycolysis and
other pathways of glucose catabolism, the TCA cycle, and
the catechol pathway of benzoate catabolism. These pathways play key roles in medical microbiology and in industrial fields such as bioremediation.

Carbohydrates, or polysaccharides, are broken down
to disaccharides, and then to monosaccharides. Sugars and sugar derivatives, such as amines and acids, are
catabolized to pyruvate.
Pyruvate and other intermediary products of sugar
catabolism are fermented, or they are further catabolized to CO2 and H 2O through the TCA cycle (in the
presence of a terminal electron acceptor) or to CO2, H 2,
and CH4 through fermentation and syntrophy.

Glucose Breakdown
and Fermentation

C6H12O6 → 2C3H4O3 + 4H (2 NADH + 2H+)
Under anaerobiosis—the prevailing condition of many
microbial habitats—the pyruvate obtained from sugar
breakdown must be converted to compounds that receive
electrons from NADH, in order to restore the electronaccepting form NAD+. Different microbes reduce pyruvate
to different end products of fermentation. Alternatively,
through respiration, NADH may reduce an electron acceptor such as oxygen or nitrate, allowing pyruvate to feed into
the TCA cycle (discussed in Section 13.6).

Note:

The carboxylic acid intermediates of metabolism exist
in equilibrium with their dissociated, or ionized, forms, identified
by the suffix “-ate.” For example, lactic acid dissociates to lactate;
acetic acid dissociates to acetate. We use the “-ate” terms for acids
whose ionized form predominates under typical cell conditions
(around pH 7).

To catabolize glucose, bacteria and archaea use three
main routes to pyruvate (Fig. 13.17):
■

■

Fermentation and respiration complete the process
of catabolism. In fermentation, the catabolite is broken
down to smaller molecules without an inorganic electron acceptor. Respiration requires an inorganic terminal electron acceptor such as O2.
Catabolism of complex substrates requires specialized
enzymes and transporters. Different bacteria contain
homologous SUS or PUL complexes that fit different
carbon sources.

ENERGETICS AND CATABOLISM

For microbes feasting on complex carbohydrates, the main
breakdown product is glucose. Glucose catabolism is important as a widespread source of energy, and also as a source of
key substrates for biosynthesis, such as five-carbon sugars to
build nucleic acids (discussed in Chapter 15).
Glucose and related sugars are catabolized through
a series of phosphorylated sugar derivatives. A common
theme in sugar catabolism is the splitting of a six-carbon
substrate into two three-carbon products. The threecarbon products may form two molecules of pyruvate:

Lipids and amino acids are catabolized to glycerol and
acetate, as well as other metabolic intermediates.
Aromatic compounds such as lignin and benzoate
derivatives are catabolized to acetate through different
pathways, such as the catechol pathway.

■

Glycolysis, or the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP)
pathway, in which glucose 6-phosphate isomerizes to
fructose 6-phosphate, ultimately forming two molecules
of pyruvate. EMP is used by many bacteria, eukaryotes,
and archaea. From each glucose, the pathway generates
net 2 ATP and 2 NADH.
Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, in which glucose
6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate, a phosphorylated sugar acid. Alternatively, sugar acids may be
converted directly to 6-phosphogluconate. Sugar acids
often derive from intestinal mucus, and the ED pathway
is essential for enteric bacteria to colonize the intestinal epithelium. The ED pathway generates only 1 ATP,
1 NADH, and 1 NADPH.
Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), also known as
the pentose phosphate shunt, in which glucose 6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate, and then

Glycolysis: The EMP Pathway

The Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, or
glycolysis, is the form of glucose catabolism most commonly studied in introductory biology; it is central for
animals and plants, as well as many bacteria. In the EMP
pathway, one molecule of D-glucose undergoes stepwise
breakdown to two molecules of pyruvic acid (or its anion,
pyruvate) (Fig. 13.18). Glucose is broken down in two
stages. In the first stage, the glucose molecule is primed for
breakdown by two steps of sugar phosphorylation by ATP.
Each ATP phosphotransfer step spends Gibbs free energy,
as we saw for glucose 6-phosphate formation in Table
13.3. The phosphoryl groups tag two sides of the glucose
molecule for subsequent splitting into two three-carbon
molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).
In the second stage, each glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
is oxidized by NAD+ through steps leading to pyruvate.
Each conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to pyruvate
forms 2 ATP—one ATP molecule from dephosphorylation
of the substrate, and one from addition of inorganic phosphate. Since 2 ATP were spent originally to phosphorylate
glucose, the net gain of energy carriers from each glucose is
2 NADH plus 2 ATP.
Most of the conversion steps are associated with a small
change in energy—so small that the sign of ΔG depends
on the concentrations of substrates or products; thus, some
individual steps are reversible. In the cytoplasm, however,
as intermediate products form they are quickly consumed
by the next step, so the pathway flows in one direction. The
direction of flow is determined by the key irreversible reactions that consume ATP. These steps drive the pathway by
spending energy.

pathway, the six-carbon sugar is activated by two phosphorylation steps
(Fig. 13.19, left). The fi rst phosphoryl group (phosphate) is added at carbon 6 of glucose. (In some species of
bacteria, the fi rst phosphoryl group is
added by phosphoenolpyruvate instead
of ATP, but the net effect is the same.)
The next enzyme-catalyzed step—
rearrangement of glucose 6-phosphate
to fructose 6-phosphate—involves no
significant change in energy but prepares the sugar to receive the second
phosphoryl group, forming fructose
1,6-bisphosphate.
The sugar then splits into two threecarbon sugars (trioses), each tagged
with one of the two phosphates. The

(ΔS), but its enthalpy change (ΔH) is unfavorable, largely
canceling out the energy yield. The two triose phosphates—
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)—have nearly the same energy,
so an enzyme interconverts them reversibly. Interconversion is necessary because only G3P proceeds further in the
pathway.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

First, the aldehyde (R–CHO) is converted to the carboxylate ion (R–COO –) plus H+. Conversion to a carboxylate releases a substantial amount of energy (negative ΔG).
This oxidation of the aldehyde represents the major source
of energy in glycolysis—the step at which the energy
obtained is used to transfer a pair of electrons onto NAD+,
forming NADH (with an ionized H+). In addition, sufficient energy is released to add a phosphoryl group (from
inorganic phosphate, Pi) to the carboxylate, generating
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.
In subsequent steps, the added phosphoryl group will
be transferred to ADP, yielding net 1 ATP per pyruvate
(2 ATP per glucose). The transfer of a phosphoryl group
from an organic substrate to make ATP is called substratelevel phosphorylation. With subtraction of the initial two
ATP molecules invested, the net energy carriers gained
from each glucose molecule are as follows:

(breakdown) and anabolism (biosynthesis) are called
amphibolic.
The amphibolic pathway of glycolysis includes enzymes
that can run in either direction, such as phosphoglucose
isomerase. The direction of the pathway at a given time is
determined by key enzymes that operate only in the catabolic direction or in the anabolic direction. For example, in
glycolysis the ATP phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate
is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase, whereas
in biosynthesis this step is reversed by a different enzyme,
fructose bisphosphatase. Instead of regenerating ATP, fructose bisphosphatase removes the second phosphoryl group
as inorganic phosphate—a step yielding energy and thus
driving the whole pathway in reverse (toward biosynthesis
of sugar). The two enzymes are regulated differently; the
catabolic enzyme phosphofructokinase is activated by ADP,
a signal of energy need, whereas the biosynthetic enzyme is
inhibited by such signals.

The Entner-Doudoroff Pathway

Regulation of glycolysis. Enzymes of catabolism are

The Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway offers a slightly
different route to catabolize sugars, as well as sugar
acids (sugars with acidic side chains). The ED pathway
was originally studied for its role in production of the
Mexican beverage pulque, or “cactus beer,” by Zymomonas
fermentation of the blue agave plant. Later, Tyrrell Conway
and colleagues discovered genes encoding the EntnerDoudoroff enzymes in the genomes of many bacteria and
archaea. In the human colon, the ED pathway enables E.
coli and other enteric bacteria to feed on mucus secreted by
the intestinal epithelium (Fig. 13.20). Some gut flora, such

regulated at the level of transcription of the enzyme.
In addition, the activities of certain enzymes in long
pathways require allosteric regulation. Allosteric regulation
by enzyme substrates and products ensures that excess
intermediates do not build up, and it avoids releasing more
energy than the cell can use at a given time. Glycolysis is
regulated so that its reactions go forward only when the
cell needs energy, not when the cell is trying to synthesize
glucose. The regulation occurs at steps where the products
are consumed so rapidly that their forward reaction is
effectively irreversible. Irreversible steps are shown as
unidirectional arrows in Figure 13.19.
Thought Question

A.

B.

Enzymes that catalyze irreversible steps are regulated so
as to maintain consistent levels of intermediates in the pathway. The most important irreversible reaction in glycolysis
is the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose
1,6-bisphosphate, mediated by the enzyme phosphofructokinase. This enzyme is activated allosterically by ADP and
inhibited by ATP or by the alternative phosphoryl donor,
phosphoenolpyruvate.
What happens when the cell needs to reverse glycolysis
in order to make glucose? Most of the intermediate reactions are reversible, so the same enzymes can be used for
biosynthesis. Pathways that participate in both catabolism

production of the mucus that they consume. These bacteria
that “farm” intestinal mucus enhance human health by
preventing pathogen colonization, and by stimulating the
immune system.
The ED pathway appears to have evolved earlier than
the EMP pathway, because it involves fewer substrate phosphorylation steps and produces less ATP, and it is found
in a wider range of prokaryotes. As in the EMP pathway, glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate
(Fig. 13.21). The next step, however, involves oxidation
by NADP+ at carbon 1, with loss of two hydrogens to form
6-phosphogluconate, a sugar acid. Gluconate is also found
in intestinal mucus; the sugar acid can be phosphorylated
to enter the ED pathway.
During ED, the hydrogens and electrons from glucose
6-phosphate are transferred to NADP+ instead of NAD+ as
in the EMP pathway. This step differs from the EMP pathway in two respects: The carrier used is NADP+ instead of
NAD+, and the electrons are transferred earlier, without a
second ATP-consuming phosphorylation step. When the

catabolic pathway, missing the formation of an ATP. The
unused potential energy is released as waste heat.
The net ATP gain from the Entner-Doudoroff pathway is
only 1 ATP per molecule of glucose—half that of the EMP
pathway (see Fig. 13.21, inset). The electrons transferred,
however, are equivalent: Instead of 2 NADH, the EntnerDoudoroff pathway generates 1 NADH and 1 NADPH.
What is the significance of NADPH, compared to
NADH? In most cases, NADH transfers electrons to the
ETS to store energy, whereas NADPH is used for biosynthesis (see Chapter 15). Thus, enzymes for amino acid
biosynthesis will use NADPH but not NADH. The ratio
between NADH and NADPH enables cells to balance their
need for energy with their need to build biomass.
Thought Question

13.9 Explain why the ED pathway generates only 1 ATP,

whereas the EMP pathway generates 2 ATP. What is the
consequence for cell metabolism?

The Pentose Phosphate Pathway

A third pathway of glucose catabolism is the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which forms the key intermediate
ribulose 5-phosphate, a five-carbon sugar. The pentose
phosphate pathway generates 1 ATP with no NADH, but
2 NADPH for biosynthesis (Fig. 13.22). In addition, the
PPP generates a complex series of intermediates that can be
redirected as substrates for biosynthesis of diverse cell components such as amino acids and vitamins.
The pentose phosphate pathway starts like the
Entner-Doudoroff pathway: Glucose 6-phosphate gives
up two electrons to form NADPH and is oxidized to
6-phosphogluconate. The next step involves a second
oxidation by NADP+, with loss of a carbon as CO2. The loss
of CO2 generates the five-carbon sugar ribulose 5-phosphate
(hence the pathway name “pentose phosphate”). In
succeeding steps, pairs of sugars, such as sedoheptulose
7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, exchange
short carbon chains, giving rise to sugar phosphates of
various lengths—for example, ribose 5-phosphate and
erythrose 4-phosphate, which are precursors of purines and
aromatic amino acids, respectively. Alternatively, if these
routes to biosynthesis are not taken, the intermediates
convert to fructose 6-phosphate and reenter the EMP
pathway, where ATP and NADH are produced.

Fermentation Completes Catabolism

None of the pathways from glucose to pyruvate constitute
completed pathways of catabolism, because NADH (and
for some pathways NADPH) remains to be recycled. In the

absence of oxygen or other electron acceptors, heterotrophic cells must transfer the hydrogens from NADH + H+
back onto the products of pyruvate, forming partly oxidized
fermentation products with the same redox level (balance of
O and H) as the original glucose had (see Table 13.5). For
example, the pyruvate may be converted to lactate by adding two electrons (with two hydrogen atoms) at the ketone,
generating an alcohol group. The product, lactic acid, has
a number of atoms (C3H6O3) equal to half of the original
glucose (C6H12O6). Overall, one glucose is converted to
two molecules of lactic acid—a process called lactic acid
fermentation:

How does lactic acid fermentation yield energy to be
stored as ATP? While two molecules of lactic acid contain
the same number of atoms and electrons as those found in
glucose, the molecular bonds are rearranged to form two
carboxylic acids. The carboxylate/carboxylic acid has multiple states and increased entropy compared to the hydroxyl
groups of glucose. Overall, glucose conversion releases free
energy, and the reaction has a net negative value of ΔG. The
ATP formation in such a reaction is called substrate-level
phosphorylation because it involves only substrate reactions, no proton pumping across membranes (discussed in
Chapter 14).
Alternative pathways of fermentation produce two molecules of ethanol plus two CO2 molecules (ethanolic fermentation) or one lactic acid, one ethanol, and one CO2
(heterolactic fermentation). Other kinds of fermentation
are shown in Table 13.5. In all cases, fermentation products must be excreted from the cell. The large quantities of
substrate consumed in fermentation generate large amounts
of waste products to be excreted. These bacterial wastes are
actually useful to human “fermentation industries” such as
the production of alcoholic beverages (ethanolic fermentation) or cheese (lactic acid fermentation).
Why do fermenting bacteria give up such large quantities of waste products that retain usable energy? The reason
is that in the absence of oxygen (or another electron acceptor), the fermentation products cannot yield energy. Most
fermentation pathways do not generate ATP beyond that
produced by substrate-level phosphorylation, the direct
transfer of a phosphate group from an organic phosphate

to ADP. An example is the final step of glycolysis, catalyzed
by pyruvate kinase (see Fig. 13.19). Much of the energy
available from glucose remains unspent or is lost as heat.
Nevertheless, fermentation is essential for microbes in environments such as anaerobic soil or animal digestive tracts.
Even aerated cultures of bacteria start fermenting once
their demand for oxygen exceeds the rate of oxygen dissolving in water. Microbes compensate for the low efficiency
of fermentation by consuming large quantities of substrate
and excreting large quantities of fermentation products. An
advantage of fermentation is that the rapid accumulation of
acids or ethanol can inhibit growth of competitors.
Mixed-acid fermentation. Numerous pathways have evolved

to dispose of the waste in different forms (Fig. 13.23).
E. coli ferments by a combination of routes known collectively as mixed-acid fermentation, forming acetate, formate, lactate, and succinate, as well as ethanol, H 2, and
CO2. Hydrogen (H 2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are the
main gases passed by the human colon.
Colonic H 2 plus CO2 can yield further energy for methanogenic microbes, through conversion to methane (discussed in Chapter 14). Excess hydrogen and methane
gases can cause problems for medical procedures such as
colonoscopy. For colonoscopy, the colon may need to be
flushed with a carbohydrate solution, which bacteria may
ferment, releasing hydrogen. When a polyp is removed
from the colon by electrocautery (high-frequency electric
current), the gas may ignite, causing an explosion. Colonic
explosion can be avoided by flushing out the gases before
electrocautery.
During mixed-acid fermentation, the proportions of
products vary with pH. Low pH favors ethanol and lactate
(which minimize acidification) over formate and acetate.
Clostridium species produce alcohols (butanol, isopropanol); Porphyromonas gingivalis, a cause of periodontal disease, produces short-chain acids (propionate, butyrate).

Many fermentation products share key intermediates,
such as acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is a versatile two-carbon
intermediate that serves as the “Lego block” of metabolism. The molecule consists of an acetyl group esterified
to coenzyme A (CoA) (Fig. 13.24), an important coenzyme whose discovery won Fritz Lipmann the 1953 Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine. CoA has a thiol (SH) that
exchanges its hydrogen for an acyl group, thus activating
the molecule for transfer in various metabolic pathways.
For example, the enzyme pyruvate formate lyase splits
pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA plus formate:

Acetyl-CoA

The SH group of CoA accepts the acetyl group to form
acetyl-CoA. The hydrogen (H+ + e –) of the SH group is
transferred onto the carboxyl carbon of pyruvate, generating formate.
Acetyl-CoA can be converted to various fermentation
products by several different pathways. The simplest is an
exchange of water with CoA, forming acetate:
CH3CO—S-CoA + H 2O

CH3COO – + H++ HS-CoA

Incorporation of water restores the hydrogen to the thiol of
CoA, and the OH to acetate. The acetate thus formed may
then be excreted by the cell.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

In soil ecosystems, various other fermentations have
evolved to utilize available substrates (see Table 13.5).
Clostridium species generate butanol and other solvents of
great industrial value. Other species ferment pairs of amino
acids, in a type of mechanism called the Stickland reaction. Fermenting a pair of amino acids avoids generating
H 2 (a loss that would waste reduction potential) and produces as much as 3 ATP. By contrast, the succinate fermentation of Propionigenium modestum is an anaerobic
reaction that proceeds with too small a ΔG value to generate a single ATP. Instead, the decarboxylation step (catalyzed by methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase) is coupled to
the pumping of sodium ions across the cell membrane. The
sodium pump stores energy (discussed in Chapter 14).

Food and Industrial Applications

The “waste products” of fermentation retain much of their
organic structure and food value. Their carbon-hydrogen
bonds retain the ability to reduce oxygen, and their organic

structures can be used for biosynthesis. Thus, fermentation
products have proved extremely useful in human culture
and technology. For thousands of years, ethanolic fermentation by yeast has been used to produce wine and beer,
while lactic acid fermentation has been used to produce
yogurt and cheese (see Chapter 16). The minor product
butyric acid (butyrate) lends taste to butter.
Fermentations involving amino acids generate small
amounts of products with intense odors and flavors. Products of amino acid catabolism confer some of the distinctive
flavors of fermented foods and beverages, such as cheese.
Swiss cheese is produced in two fermentation stages. In the
first stage, at high temperature, thermophilic lactic acid
bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus and Streptococcus
salivarius ferment the milk sugar lactose, a disaccharide of
glucose and galactose, generating mainly lactic acid. In the
second stage, Propionibacterium freudenreichii converts
lactate to propionate, acetate, and CO2, which bubbles to
form the “eyes” (Fig. 13.25). The propionate contributes
to the distinctive flavor of Swiss cheese, along with other
minor side products that have intense flavors. For more on
Swiss-cheese fermentation, see eTopic 13.2. Microbial food
production is discussed in Chapter 16.
In the chemical industry, microbial fermentation produces industrial solvents such as butanol and acetone. Acetone production had historic impact during World War I,
when Britain needed a source of acetone to manufacture
gunpowder. Acetone and butanol were produced as fermentation products by Clostridium acetobutylicum, a bacterium identified by the biochemist Chaim Weizmann.
Weizmann was a Russian-born Jew who sought a Jewish
homeland in Palestine. At the end of the war, Weizmann’s
process for acetone production helped

hospitals use rapid and inexpensive biochemical tests
(Chapter 28). A pH indicator added to growth media can
detect the acid produced when a substrate is fermented,
resulting in a color change (Fig. 13.26A). Phenol red is
a pH indicator that is orange-red at neutral pH. It turns
yellow in media acidified by fermentation acids (below pH
6.8) and red at higher pH (above pH 7.4). A culture of Escherichia coli, which ferments quickly, turns phenol red to a
medium yellow after 24 hours. Alcaligenes faecalis, meanwhile, ferments poorly on sugar but converts peptides in
the broth to alkaline amines; this culture turns deep red.
More specific tests depend on the microbe’s ability to
ferment specific sugars. Different species possess different
enzymes able to convert different sugars and sugar derivatives to glucose, which then enters the common fermentation pathway. A well-known example is the use of sorbitol
MacConkey agar to test for E. coli O157:H7, a lethal pathogen contaminating beef and vegetables. The O157:H7
strain of E. coli has a set of virulence genes absent from
nonpathogenic E. coli strains that are present among our
normal colon biota. But the pathogen also happens to
lack genes present in normal E. coli, such as a gene encoding an enzyme to ferment sorbitol. Thus, failure to ferment sorbitol indicates a high probability that the strain is
E. coli O157:H7. On sorbitol MacConkey agar, bacteria
that ferment sorbitol during growth produce acids. The
acidity causes a dye to turn red (the opposite of the phenol red test). Failure to ferment sorbitol (observed as pale
colonies) indicates high probability of E. coli O157:H7
(Fig. 13.26B).

as substrates for biosynthesis. The PPP may produce 1
ATP and 2 NADPH.
Glucose catabolism is reversible, enabling cells to
build glucose from small molecules.
Fermentation is the completion of catabolism without the electron transport system and a terminal electron acceptor. The electrons from NADH are restored
to pyruvate or its products in reactions that generate
fermentation products, including alcohols and carboxylates, as well as H 2 and CO2. Energy is stored in the form
of ATP.
Fermentation has applications in food, industrial, and
diagnostic microbiology.

13.6

The TCA Cycle and
Aromatic Catabolism

The products of sugar breakdown can be catabolized to
CO2 and H 2O through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle. The TCA cycle generates molecules of NADH and
FADH 2, which donate electrons to an electron transport
system (ETS) with a terminal electron acceptor such
as O2 (see Chapter 14). But sugars are not the cycle’s
only substrates. Lignins, phenolics, and even polycyclic
aromatic toxins are degraded to products that enter the
TCA cycle.
The TCA cycle is also known as the Krebs cycle, named
for Hans Krebs (1900–1981), who shared the 1953 Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Fritz Lipmann. Krebs

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

and his colleagues at Sheffield University, England, studied
catabolism by observing the oxidizing activities of crude
enzyme preparations from sources such as pigeon breast
muscle, beef liver, and cucumber seeds. In all of these animal and plant tissues, the TCA cycle is conducted by mitochondria, using virtually the same process as their bacterial
ancestors used.

Pyruvate Is Converted to Acetyl-CoA

Glucose catabolism connects with the TCA cycle through
the breakdown of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2. Recall
from Figure 13.14 that acetyl-CoA is also generated from
many other catabolic pathways, including those for breakdown of fatty acids, amino acids, and lignin fragments in
soil. Regardless of its source, acetyl-CoA enters the TCA
cycle by condensing with the four-carbon intermediate
oxaloacetate to form citrate (Fig. 13.27). Citrate undergoes two steps of oxidative decarboxylation, in which CO2
is released and two hydrogens with electrons are transferred to make NADH + H+ or FADH 2. The TCA cycle,
in whole or in part, is found in all microbial species except
for degenerately evolved pathogens that are dependent on
host metabolism, such as Treponema pallidum, the cause of
syphilis (eTopic 13.3).

13.10 If a cell respiring on glucose runs out of oxygen and
other electron acceptors, what happens to the electrons
transferred from the catabolic substrates?

We present first the connecting step between pyruvate
and acetyl-CoA, followed by the details of the TCA cycle.
Bacteria and archaea use at least ten known variations on
the TCA cycle, conducted by diverse species under various
environmental conditions. You will no doubt be relieved to
hear that we present only one: the Krebs pathway, which
is found in most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and in most eukaryotes. Other pathways are detailed
in online resources such as the KEGG Pathway Database.
Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA through removal
of CO2 and transfer of 2e – onto NAD+. The removal of
CO2 and transfer of two electrons is known as oxidative
decarboxylation. The oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, coupled to CoA incorporation, is performed by an
unusually large multisubunit enzyme called the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex, or PDC. PDC is a key component of metabolism in bacteria and mitochondria, the first
molecular player to direct sugar catabolism into respiration.
In human mitochondria, defects in PDC affect organs that
have a high metabolic rate, such as heart and brain, causing
myocardial malfunction and heart failure, and neurodegeneration. A structural model for PDC, and the details of its
reaction mechanism, are shown in eTopic 13.4.
The overall reactions catalyzed by PDC are:

enters the TCA cycle.

CH3COCOO – + H+ + HS-CoA →
CH3CO-S-CoA + CO2 + 2H+ + 2e –
NAD+ + 2H+ + 2e – → NADH + H+

The removal of stable CO2 yields energy for the electron
transfer to NADH. The protons dissociated from pyruvate
and from the thiol (SH) of CoA (2H+ in total) are balanced
by the net gain of protons by NADH + H+.
The activity of PDC is increased by high concentrations
of its substrates (CoA and NAD+) and inhibited by its products (acetyl-CoA and NADH). The product acetyl-CoA
may enter one of several pathways. In E. coli, when glucose is plentiful, acetyl-CoA is mostly converted to acetate
via the intermediate acetyl phosphate (Fig. 13.27). Acetyl phosphate is a global signaling molecule that indicates
to the cell the quantity and quality of carbon source available. As glucose decreases, the cell starts to reclaim acetate, converting it back to acetyl-CoA for entry into the
TCA cycle. At the level of gene expression, PDC responds
to environmental conditions. As would be expected, PDC
gene expression is repressed by carbon starvation and by
low levels of oxygen.

CHAPTER 13

Thought Question

13.11 Compare the reactions catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate lyase (see Section 13.5). What
conditions favor each reaction, and why?

Acetyl-CoA Enters the TCA Cycle

Recall that acetyl-CoA can participate in various fermentations (see Fig. 13.23). But when a strong terminal electron acceptor is available (such as O2), acetyl-CoA can enter
the TCA cycle to transfer its electrons to electron carriers
(Figs. 13.27 and 13.28). First, the acetyl group condenses
with oxaloacetate, a four-carbon dicarboxylate (double
acid). The condensation forms citrate, a six-carbon tricarboxylate. An advantage of intermediates with two or more
acidic groups is that the concentration of the fully protonated form is extremely low; thus, the molecule is unlikely to
be lost from the cell by diffusion across the membrane, as
are monocarboxylic acids, such as acetate.
Through the rest of the cycle, citrate loses two carbons
as CO2 by a series of reactions that transfer increments of
energy to 3 NADH, 1 FADH 2, and 1 ATP. Each reaction step couples energy-yielding to energy-storing events
(Fig. 13.28).
Step 1. As the acetyl group condenses with oxaloacetate, the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA consumes a molecule of H 2O to restore HS-CoA. The removal of
HS-CoA yields energy to condense acetate with oxaloacetate, forming citrate.
Step 2. Citrate undergoes two rearrangements (with
little energy change) to form isocitrate. Isocitrate
then undergoes oxidative decarboxylation. As we
saw for pyruvate, removal of CO2 yields energy to
transfer 2H+ + 2e – to form NADH + H+, producing
2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate).
Step 3. 2-Oxoglutarate undergoes decarboxylation to
release CO2 and make another NADH + H+. In this
case, CoA is incorporated, making succinyl-CoA.
Step 4. Succinyl-CoA releases CoA, yielding energy
to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. To form fumarate,
2H+ + 2e – are transferred to FAD to form FADH 2 —
a reaction involving negligible free energy change.
FAD is reduced instead of NAD+ because electron
donation from succinyl-CoA does not yield enough
energy to reduce NAD+.
Step 5. Fumarate incorporates water across its double
bond, forming the hydroxy acid malate. The increasing stability from fumarate to malate and from malate
to oxaloacetate yields enough energy to form the final
NADH + H+. Oxaloacetate is the original intermediate
of the cycle, which again accepts the next acetyl-CoA.

Note:

Some textbooks state that succinyl-CoA synthetase, the
enzyme catalyzing step 4 in the TCA cycle (Fig. 13.28), phosphorylates GDP to GTP. According to the primary literature, ADP phosphorylation predominates in E. coli (Margaret Birney et al. 1996.
J. Bacteriol. 178:2883), whereas in Pseudomonas species, various
nucleoside diphosphates are phosphorylated (Vinayak Kapatral et
al. 2000. J. Bacteriol. 182:1333). Human mitochondria have two
enzymes, which form ATP and GTP, respectively (David Lambeth
et al. 2004. J. Biol. Chem. 279:36621).

Observing the TCA cycle intermediates. How were all
the TCA intermediates identified? The main experimental
approach available to Krebs and his contemporaries was to
guess at dozens of short-chain acids known to exist in cells,
and then to add each individually to an enzyme preparation and test for TCA cycle activity. In aerobic organisms,
the TCA cycle is tightly tied to respiration, so an increase
in uptake of oxygen signaled a TCA intermediate. A major
experimental advance was the use of tracer isotopes such as
14
C, discovered by Martin Kamen in 1940 (see eTopic 15.1).
Radioisotope tracers answered an important question about the TCA cycle. As the two acetyl carbons cycle
through, which two carbons of each intermediate are
removed as CO2? Which carbons are lost first: the acetyl
carbons or those of the original oxaloacetate? This question was answered by use of substrates radiolabeled with
14
C (highlighted green in Fig. 13.28). In the experiment,
bacteria are fed 14C-radiolabeled acetate, which enters
the TCA cycle. The radiolabeled carbons are captured by
the TCA intermediates and retained into the next cycle,
whereas two COOH carbons from the original oxaloacetate are lost. Thus, the four-carbon intermediate does not
recycle intact, but breaks down and re-forms each time it
passes through the cycle.
Loss of the second CO2 forms succinyl-CoA, which is
converted to succinate. Succinate is a symmetrical molecule;
thus, the former identities of the acetyl and oxaloacetate
moieties are now erased, and the carbons are equally likely
to disappear from either half of the molecule. Further conversion steps regenerate oxaloacetate—half its carbon from
the acetyl group and half from the original oxaloacetate.
Thought Question

13.12 Suppose a cell is pulse-labeled with 14C-acetate (fed

the 14C label briefly, then “chased” with unlabeled acetate).
Can you predict what will happen to the level of radioactivity
observed in isolated TCA intermediates? Plot a curve showing your predicted level of radioactivity as a function of the
number of rounds of the cycle.

acetate generates 3 NADH molecules, 1 FADH2, and 1 ATP;
and all the carbons from pyruvate (ultimately from glucose)

have been released as waste CO2. From the standpoint of the
carbon skeleton, the glucose breakdown is now complete. But
do we have a completed metabolic pathway? No, because all
of the NADH and FADH2 need to be recycled by donating
their electrons onto a terminal electron acceptor.
The process of electron transfer from NADH and
FADH 2 is mediated by the electron transport system (ETS,
discussed in Chapter 14). In the ETS, electrons are transferred from reduced proteins and cofactors to more oxidized
proteins and cofactors, as in the examples in Table 13.4.

Some of the membrane proteins use the energy of electron
transfer to pump protons, generating a gradient of hydrogen ions across the membrane (Fig. 13.29)—a process discussed in detail in Chapter 14.
Assuming a theoretical maximum yield of 3 ATP generated per NADH and 2 ATP per FADH 2, the hydrogen ion
gradient then drives the membrane ATP synthase to synthesize as many as 34 ATP. Another 4 ATP come from glucose breakdown and the TCA cycle (38 total per glucose).
Under actual conditions, however, bacteria make less ATP;

■ Complete oxidation of glucose.
Glucose catabolism generates ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation and
through the electron transport system’s pumping of H+ ions to drive the ATP synthase. The complete oxidative breakdown of glucose to CO2
and H2O could theoretically generate up to 38 ATP. Under actual conditions, the number is smaller.

about 20 ATP per glucose are made by a well-aerated culture of E. coli. Bacterial cells make trade-offs for flexibility,
spending energy to maintain a stable proton potential during extreme changes in external pH and redox levels.
The overall process of electron transport and ATP generation is termed oxidative phosphorylation. The overall
process of oxidative catabolism from substrate breakdown
to oxidative phosphorylation is a form of respiration. The
overall equation for the aerobic respiration of glucose is:

cycle called the glyoxylate bypass (Fig. 13.30A). The glyoxylate bypass allows lung pathogens such as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to catabolize
fatty acids, via their breakdown to acetyl-CoA.
The glyoxylate bypass consists of two enzymes that
divert isocitrate to glyoxylate, and then incorporate a second acetyl-CoA to form malate. The malate can then regenerate oxaloacetate to complete the bypass cycle, donating
2e – to form NADH. The net reaction is:

C6H12O6 + 6H 2O + 6O2 → 12H 2O + 6CO2

2 Acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate + NAD+ →
succinate + malate + 2 CoA + NADH + H+

Glucose respiration can generate a relatively large number of ATPs per glucose—far more than fermentation can.
In bacteria, however, the actual number of ATP molecules
generated varies widely with availability of carbon source and
oxygen. For example, as oxygen decreases in the environment,
the ability to oxidize NADH decreases, so the cell may make
only 1 or 2 ATP per NADH (discussed in Chapter 14). In
addition, the enzymes of the TCA cycle are regulated extensively by substrate activation and product inhibition, and their
expression is induced by high levels of oxygen and glucose.
Glyoxylate bypass. What happens when glucose is scarce
and cells need carbon both for energy and for biosynthesis?
Bacteria may catabolize lipids instead of glucose, breaking
down the fatty acids into acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle.
But oxygen may be limited, and carbons would be lost as
CO2. Some bacteria can switch to using a modified TCA

Alternatively, malate or oxaloacetate can be diverted into
biosynthesis of glucose (gluconeogenesis)—a pathway that
reverses much of glucose catabolism (see Chapter 15). Most
bacteria need sugar biosynthesis to build their cell walls.
The glyoxylate bypass cuts out all loss of CO2 and electron transfer to energy carriers, with the exception of 1
FADH 2 and possibly 1 NADH from malate to oxaloacetate. Thus, limited energy is released, but two carbons can
be diverted to biosynthesis. Figure 13.30B shows how the
pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses the glyoxylate
bypass. A mystery of the disease tuberculosis is the ability
of M. tuberculosis to persist for long periods, growing slowly
within macrophages. What carbon source and metabolism
does the pathogen use? The question was addressed by
labeling infected cells with carbon sources enriched for the
isotope 13C. The intracellular bacteria were then isolated

The TCA cycle for amino acid biosynthesis. Analysis of

pathway evolution indicates that the TCA cycle originally
evolved to provide substrates for building amino acids (see
Chapter 15). For example, the TCA cycle intermediate
2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) is aminated to form
glutamate, which leads to glutamine. The amine group
comes from nitrogen gas fi xed to ammonium ion (discussed with biosynthesis in Chapter 15). Oxaloacetate is
aminated to form aspartate, entering pathways to purines
and pyrimidines as well. The TCA cycle, like glycolysis,
is an amphibolic pathway that provides substrates for biosynthesis. Many bacteria use the TCA cycle and glycolytic
enzymes to build their sugars and amino acids, as discussed
in Chapter 15. Others, such as Treponema pallidum, the
cause of syphilis, have lost the TCA cycle by reductive evolution. They must obtain amino acids synthesized by their
host organism (see eTopic 13.3).

growth. Thus, key enzymes of the glyoxylate bypass, and
their regulators, offer targets for new antibiotics.

Catabolism of Benzene Derivatives

The TCA cycle plays a key role in the breakdown of aromatic
carbon sources such as the benzene ring. Natural sources of
aromatic carbon include lignin from wood, and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from petroleum. Aromatic
components of petroleum cause much of the environmental damage during oil spills such as the Deepwater Horizon
spill in 2010. Soil is often polluted by industrial aromatic
compounds, such as nitrate explosives, aniline dyes, and
the solvent toluene. Even the most remote places on Earth,
such as Antarctica, show traces of such pollutants.
To remove aromatic pollutants from water and soil, we
depend on microbial catabolism. Aromatic molecules are
notoriously difficult to catabolize because of the stability of
the benzene ring. The benzene ring breaks down slowly, but
over time, bacteria and fungi catabolize a wide range of aromatic molecules. Figure 13.31 shows an example of research
to study microbial digestion of phenanthrene (a tricyclic
PAH) in the soil of Antarctica. Because the Antarctic Treaty
forbids introduction of exogenous organisms, any bioremediation of pollutants must be accomplished by native microbes.
Uchechukwu Okere and colleagues at Lancaster University sought evidence for phenanthrene biodegradation by
soil microbial communities at Livingston Island, off the
tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. The temperatures at this

appear to be psychrotrophs (cold tolerant) rather than psychrophiles, which require cold for growth. Psychrotrophs
may take advantage of a temporary rise in temperature to
outgrow their competitors.
How do microbes catabolize such tough carbon sources?
As we saw earlier (Fig. 13.14), fungi and bacteria break down
lignin and PAHs to form single-ring aromatic compounds
such as benzoate and phenols. Some of these products have
commercial uses—benzoate is a food preservative; vanillin,
a flavor additive; phenol, an industrial solvent. In nature,
the single-ring compounds are further catabolized to acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle. Benzoate, activated to
benzoyl-CoA, has a central role in the catabolism of aromatic
molecules, comparable to that of glucose in polysaccharide
catabolism. Bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus
species degrade benzoate and related molecules aerobically or
anaerobically. Anaerobic degradation takes much longer, but
it is critical because the volume of anaerobic habitat (such as
soil) greatly exceeds that of oxygenated habitat.

northernmost end of the continent are moderately cold,
between 3°C in southern summer and –11°C in winter.
Okere incubated soil samples with phenanthrene substrates
containing 14C-radiolabeled carbons. The incubation was
performed in a respirometer with a CO2 trap, and the 14C
radioactivity was measured in the trapped CO2. Okere
found that over 10–30 days, microbes degraded as much as
30% of the phenanthrene to CO2. The degradation rate was
higher at higher temperatures; thus, the catabolic microbes

matic compounds, such as toluene (methylbenzene), chlorobenzoate, and nitrobenzene, can be catabolized via
sequential oxidation steps, requiring the presence of an
ETS that terminates with O2 (Fig. 13.32). Early in the
pathways, enzymes must remove substituents such as chlorides or nitrates. The methyl group of toluene is oxidized
to carboxylate (R–COO –), whose removal then drives a key
breakdown step. Aerobic degradation commonly proceeds
through the intermediate catechol, a benzene ring bearing two adjacent hydroxyl groups. Each benzene derivative is converted to catechol by a specific dioxygenase, an
enzyme that coordinately oxygenates two adjacent ring carbons. Next follows ring cleavage and breakdown to pyruvate (forming NADH) and to acetyl-CoA, which may enter
the TCA cycle and respiration.
The intermediate catechol then undergoes another key
oxidation by a catechol dioxygenase, which adds two more
oxygens while cleaving the ring. In different bacterial species, the enzyme may oxidize catechol at either the 1,2
positions or the 2,3 positions, as shown in Figure 13.32.
Typical products are succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, which
enter the TCA cycle, completing breakdown to CO2. The
details of benzene catabolism vary among bacterial species,
and many diverse mechanisms continue to be discovered.
Anaerobic benzene catabolism. A challenge for biodegradation is that many pollution sources reach deep underground, where the soil is anoxic. Thus, oxygen is unavailable
to conduct the conversions shown in Figure 13.32, particularly the formation of carboxylate (R–COO –) and the
introduction of hydroxyl groups. How can microbes catabolize benzene and benzoate derivatives without oxygen?

Oxidative
catabolism of benzoate and various related compounds proceeds
through catechols. Catechols are degraded through several alternative pathways to the TCA cycle. Steps requiring oxidation are
marked O2. Inset: Bird contaminated by petroleum from an offshore
wellhead.

In early stages of anaerobic catabolism (Fig. 13.33),
benzene and naphthalene incorporate CO2, forming the
carboxylate group of benzoate. Because CO2 is a very weak
oxidant, these reactions require input of energy by hydrolysis of ATP. The carboxylate is then activated by HS-CoA,
forming benzoyl-CoA, the same key intermediate as for
aerobic benzene catabolism.
Anaerobically, the benzoyl-CoA must use reducing
energy from NADH to hydrogenate its ring carbons, thus
breaking the aromaticity. Some bacteria spend ATP as well,
whereas others, such as the iron-reducing bacterium Geobacter metallireducens, can break the ring without spending ATP. The hydroxyl groups that enable shifting of the
double-bond positions are introduced by incorporation of
H 2O. Catabolism continues, forming three acetyl groups

requires high initial investment of reducing energy—one
reason the process operates slowly. For soil bacteria, the
energy invested must come from anaerobic phototrophy or
from anaerobic respiration.
The discovery of effective benzene degraders is of great
interest for bioremediation of sites such as the South Platte
River, north of Denver, where a spill from the Suncor oil
refinery in 2011 released benzene (Fig. 13.34A). To identify novel benzene-degrading microbes, Nidal Abu Laban
and colleagues at the Helmholtz Centre, Munich, performed benzene enrichment culture of soil from a coal
gasification site. From the enrichment culture, the predominant organism was identified as Pelotomaculum species of
clostridia, Gram-positive endospore-forming bacteria. The

gene sequence (for methods, see Chapter 17).
Pelotomaculum bacteria are related to other clostridia
that use the anaerobic electron acceptor sulfate (SO42–). So
Abu Laban hypothesized that sulfate could be used during benzene catabolism. In the experiment whose results
are plotted in Figure 13.34B, 13CO2 was measured by gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), a technique
that measures molecular masses and can thus distinguish
“heavy isotopes” such as 13C from the more common isotope 12C. When benzene enrichment was performed in the
presence of sulfate, the 13C-labeled benzene showed conversion to 13CO2, while at the same time the sulfate concentration decreased. The autoclaved controls showed no
change in 13CO2 or sulfate concentration. These data are
consistent with anaerobic breakdown of benzene via the
TCA cycle and ETS, with sulfate oxidation.

The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) removes
CO2 from pyruvate, generating acetyl-CoA. PDC activity is a key control point of metabolism, induced when
carbon sources are plentiful, and repressed under carbon
starvation and low oxygen.
The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) converts the
acetyl group to 2CO2 and 2H 2O in the presence of a
terminal electron acceptor such as O2 to receive the electrons associated with the hydrogen atoms.
Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle by condensing
with oxaloacetate to form citrate. A series of enzymes
sequentially removes carbon dioxide and water molecules and generates 3 NADH, 1 FADH 2, and 1 ATP.
Each reaction step couples energy-yielding to energystoring events.
The glyoxylate bypass provides a way to gain limited
energy from the TCA cycle while avoiding CO2 loss; thus
the bypass diverts intermediates to sugar biosynthesis.
Catabolism of aromatic molecules by bacteria and
fungi recycles lignin and PAHs within ecosystems. Aromatic metabolism is used for bioremediation.
Benzoate undergoes aerobic catabolism to catechol.
The catechol ring is cleaved, generating acetyl-CoA,
which enters the TCA cycle.
Anaerobic catabolism of benzoate involves activation by HS-CoA and reduction by NADH. The energy

14.1 Electron Transport Systems

What is so exciting about microbial
electricity?

Geobacter species are ubiquitous in
the environment. They have the ability to transfer electrons located on the
outer cell surface to extracellular electron acceptors such as insoluble metal
oxides and oxidized metals. These
microorganisms can produce electricity by transferring electrons to anodes in microbial fuel cells, thereby earning them
the title of “electric microbes.”
How do you think our assumptions will change about redox
metabolism in environmental microbial communities?
Geobacter can transfer electrons to partner species through
direct electrical connections—a process known as direct
interspecies electron transfer. Interspecies electron transfer in anaerobic environments has paved the way for a thrilling area of research in microbiology. A fuller understanding
of the process and its role in anaerobic environments will
help us devise better strategies for wastewater digestion or
methane emission control in environments such as landfills,
rice paddies, and animal intestinal systems. The potential for
discovery promises an “electrifying” future!

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Electric current in living organisms has fascinated scientists ever since the eighteenth century, when Luigi Galvani
(1737–1798) showed that a voltage caused a dead frog limb
to flex. The idea of biological electricity inspired Mary Shelley’s famous novel Frankenstein: or, the Modern Prometheus,
in which a physician is imagined to “create life” by jolting body parts with an electric shock. Today we know that
electric current flows in all cells. Bacteria such as Geobacter
species (see the Current Research Highlight) can transfer
electrons from an electrode onto hydrogen ions, forming
hydrogen gas. First isolated by Derek Lovley at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Geobacter can extract
electrons from organic molecules, iron, and even uranium.
In a soil community, Geobacter and other microbes transfer electrons from cell to cell, in a syntrophy that enhances
growth of all the cells involved. For example, Lovley’s students showed how Geobacter metallireducens can form an
“electrical” coculture with Methanosaeta, a methanogen
(Fig. 14.1). The Geobacter cells oxidize ethanol and then
transfer the electrons to the methanogen, which reduces
CO2 to methane. This electrical syntrophy supports digestion in water treatment plants, and it can be a source of
usable electric current.
How do cells make electricity? The energy-yielding reactions we saw in Table 13.1 involve transfer of electrons from
one molecule to another. Much of the energy yield comes

from successive redox steps within an electron transport
system (ETS) of carriers in a membrane, whose energyyielding redox reactions are coupled to transport of ions
such as protons (H+). Types of metabolism that use an ETS
include organotrophy (organic electron donors), lithotrophy (inorganic electron donors), and phototrophy (light
absorption excites electrons). Some bacteria and archaea are
specialists, whereas others use more than one of these types
of metabolism. Even organisms with very different forms of
metabolism show common themes in their mechanisms of
electron transfer. In fact, the protein complexes for processes as different as organotrophy and phototrophy show
homology, indicating that they evolved from a common
ancestral ETS.
Chapter 14 presents electron flow through the ETS in
organotrophy, lithotrophy, and phototrophy. In each step of
the ETS, a molecule becomes “reduced” (gains an electron)
while the molecule donating the electron becomes “oxidized” (loses an electron). In various kinds of metabolism,
some of the energy from electron transfer is stored in the
form of an electrochemical potential (voltage) across a membrane. The potential is composed of the chemical concentration gradient of H+ ions plus the charge difference across the
membrane. The proton potential drives ATP synthesis. Ion
potentials also drive nutrient uptake, mediate pathogenesis
of infective microbes, and shape the chemistry surrounding

a microbe. Microbial electron transfer reactions, and the
ion potentials they generate, have profound consequences
for ecosystems; they acidify or alkalinize soil and water, and
they can contribute or remove nitrogen and minerals.

14.1

Electron Transport
Systems

As we learned in Chapter 13, energy to support life is
obtained through reactions that convert substrates to products of lower energy—that is, reactions in which ΔG (free
energy change) is negative. Many reactions involve transfer of
electrons from a reduced electron donor to an oxidized electron acceptor. The simplest path of electron flow is found in
fermentation, where electrons from the fermented substrate,
such as glucose, are transferred onto NAD+ to make NADH
(reduction), and then returned to the glucose breakdown
products. More complex kinds of metabolism, such as aerobic
respiration, transfer electrons through a series of membranesoluble carriers called an electron transport system (ETS),
also known as an electron transport chain (ETC).
Unlike cytoplasmic redox reactions, a membraneembedded ETS can convert its energy into an ion potential or
electrochemical potential between two compartments separated by the membrane. The ion potential is most commonly
a proton (H+) potential, also known as proton motive force
(PMF). The proton motive force drives essential cell processes such as synthesis of ATP (discussed in Section 14.2).

Each ETS finally transfers its electrons to a terminal electron acceptor molecule, whose product may exit the cell.
Metabolism using an ETS is classified based on the
nature of the initial electron donors and terminal electron
acceptors. In this chapter we cover three major classes of
prokaryotic energy acquisition involving an ETS (their relationships are summarized in Table 13.1):
■

Organotrophy (or chemoorganotrophy) is a form of
metabolism in which organic molecules donate electrons. If the electrons are donated to a membraneembedded electron transport system, and ultimately
reduce a terminal electron acceptor, the overall pathway
is called “respiration.” The terminal electron acceptor
may be O2 for aerobic respiration, or an alternative electron acceptor such as nitrate (NO3 –) for anaerobic respiration. Some terminal electron acceptors are organic
(such as fumarate, – O2C–CH= CH–CO2 –).

■

Lithotrophy (or chemoautotrophy) is the oxidation
of inorganic electron donors, such as Fe2+ or H2. The
electron acceptor may be O2 or an anaerobic alternative,
such as NO3 –. A strong electron donor, such as H2, can
use organic electron acceptors such as fumarate. Some
chemoorganotrophs that catabolize many substrates are
“facultative lithotrophs”—for example, oxidizing sulfur
compounds. But many lithotrophs are obligate autotrophs,
fixing CO2 for biosynthesis (discussed in Chapter 15).
These specialist organisms are called chemolithoautotrophs. For example, the bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea obtains nearly all its energy by oxidizing ammonia.

■

Phototrophy involves light capture by chlorophyll, usually
coupled to splitting of H2S or H2O (photolysis). Photoautotrophs couple photolysis to CO2 fixation for forming biomass (discussed in Chapter 15). Photoheterotrophs absorb
light to generate ATP, while incorporating preformed carbon compounds for biosynthesis. Photoheterotrophs may
also capture light energy to supplement catabolism, which
provides electron donors (photoorganotrophy).

Organo-: Organic molecules donate electrons.

Note:

Electron Donors and Acceptors

Different types of metabolism use electron transport systems with different components embedded in the bacterial membrane. For chemotrophy (oxidizing an electron
donor to yield energy), each ETS must accept electrons
from an initial electron donor. The electron donor may
be an organic “food” molecule, such as glucose (organotrophy), or a reduced mineral, such as Fe2+ (lithotrophy).
Next, the ETS proteins and cofactors act sequentially as
electron donors and acceptors, whose oxidation-reduction
reactions are coupled to H+ transport across the membrane.

The term respiration refers to metabolism in which
chemical electron donors yield energy through an ETS. In this book
we reserve the term “respiration” for an ETS with organic electron
donors (organotrophy). The use of inorganic electron donors for
an ETS is called lithotrophy. Other fields use the term “respiration”
differently. In medical physiology, “respiration” refers to catabolism with an ETS, or to the process of carbon dioxide exchange with
oxygen through breathing. In ecology, “respiration” refers to carbon flux in an ecosystem, or throughout the atmosphere.

Energy Storage

In Chapter 13 we showed how the free energy change ΔG
determines whether energy can be obtained from a given

reaction of substrates to products. Similar considerations of
ΔG govern the reactions of electron flow through an ETS
and the storage of energy in transmembrane ion gradients.
The reduction potential. To obtain energy, biochemical

reactions require a negative ΔG. In oxidation-reduction
reactions (redox reactions), the ΔG values are proportional
to the reduction potential (E) between the oxidized form
of a molecule (electron acceptor) and its reduced form
(electron donor). The reduction potential represents the
tendency of a compound to accept electrons, measured in
volts (V) or millivolts (mV). A positive value of E has
a negative ΔG, so the gain of electrons yields energy. A
negative value of E means that the reverse reaction (loss of
electrons) yields energy.
The oxidized and reduced states of a compound are
called a redox couple. An example of a redox couple is the
electron acceptor O2 and the electron donor H 2O. Because
O2 is a strong electron acceptor (readily gains 2e –), the
redox couple ½O2 /H 2O has a high positive value of E. So
when O2 plus 2H+ + 2e – forms H 2O, the reaction yields a
large amount of energy.
Standard values of E (E°) are known as the standard reduction potential. The standard reduction potential E°′ assumes a
concentration of 1 M for all components at pH 7. For example,
the value of E°′ for H2 formation from 2H+ + 2e– is –420 mV.
This large negative reduction potential means that it takes

a lot of energy to add the two electrons to 2H+. Thus, the
reverse reaction donating 2e– from H2 to an appropriate electron acceptor yields a lot of energy. An example of microbes
that use this reaction for energy is hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria
growing in oral biofilms, causing gum disease.
Reduction potentials represent a form of the standard
free energy change, ΔG°′. The value of ΔG°′ (in kilojoules
per mole, or kJ/mol) for an electron transfer reaction with
a given reduction potential E°′ is given by
ΔG°′ = –nFE°′
where n is the number of electrons transferred, F is Faraday’s constant (F = 96.5 kJ/V · mol), and E°′ is the reduction potential (V) at 1 M concentration, 25°C, and pH 7.
Thus, E°′ represents the standard reduction potential per
electron, whereas ΔG°′ gives the overall free energy change.
Note that the reaction is favored for positive values of E,
which correspond to negative values of ΔG.
The standard reduction potential E°′ gives the potential
difference between the oxidized and reduced states under
standard conditions, when both oxidized and reduced
forms are at equal concentrations—namely, 1 M. Assuming
equal concentrations at 1 M, we may compare E°′ of various
molecules available in the environment for microbial respiration. Such a comparison generates an “electron tower”
representing the reduction potential E°′ of molecules that
may act as electron acceptors or donors (Table 14.1). The

oxidized state of each redox couple in the table is shown in
red, the reduced state in blue.
A more positive E°′ means that reducing the electron
acceptor yields more energy. A more negative value of E°′ means
that oxidizing the electron donor yields more energy. Either form
of half reaction, in the favored direction, is associated with a negative value of ΔG°′.

In the electron tower, the more negative values of E°′
represent couples (half reactions) with a stronger electron
donor (H 2, NADH), whereas the more positive values represent stronger electron acceptors (O2, NO3 –). For example, in the redox couple NAD+/NADH + H+, the oxidized
form is NAD+ and the reduced form is NADH. The reduction potential is strongly negative (–320 mV), so NADH
is a strong electron donor; that is, the reverse reaction,
NADH + H+ → NAD+, releases a lot of energy (+320 mV).
A complete redox reaction combines two redox couples:
one accepting electrons (red column), the other donating electrons (blue column, arrow reversed). Redox couples with more negative values of E°′ can provide electron
donors (blue column) for electron acceptors with more
positive values of E°′ (red column). The E°′ for the overall
reaction is then given by adding the reversed reaction of the
electron donor E°′ to the electron acceptor E°′. A positive
value of E°′ means that the reaction may proceed to provide energy. For example, the oxidation of NADH by O2
results from combining two couples: O2/H 2O (forward)
and NADH/NAD+ (reversed from Table 14.1). For the
reversed couple, the sign of E°′ changes:

The aerobic oxidation of NADH pairs a strong electron
donor (NADH) with a strong electron acceptor (O2). Thus,
NADH oxidation via the ETS provides the cell with a huge
amount of potential energy (comparable to a 1-V battery
cell) to make ATP and generate ion gradients. NADH is
oxidized by many electron transport systems of bacteria
and archaea, as well as mitochondria. Whenever we digest
food, we make NADH for our mitochondria to oxidize.
Bacteria and archaea have evolved many alternative
donor-acceptor systems; the one they use depends on
what their environment provides. For example in anaerobic marine sediment, the proteobacterium Shewanella can
donate electrons to many alternative oxidized minerals

as terminal electron acceptors, including iron, lead, and
nitrate. How does Shewanella gain access to immobilized
minerals? The bacterium grows “nanowires” to transport
electrons some distance from the cell (Fig. 14.2). The
nanowires develop as a chain of outer membrane vesicles
that lengthen into narrow tubes. A membrane-specific
fluorophore shows that the nanowire is composed of
membrane.
Electron donors can also be oxidized by organic molecules. In the human colon, which lacks molecular oxygen,
Escherichia coli can oxidize NADH by transferring 2e – onto
fumarate, which is reduced to succinate. From Table 14.1,
we find that:
NADH + H+ + fumarate → NAD+ + succinate
E°′ = 320 mV + 33 mV = 353 mV
ΔG°′ = –68 kJ/mol
The fumarate reduction potential is small but yields
some energy for growth. When oxygen reappears in the
environment, the succinate can donate electrons to O2,
forming fumarate and water:
½O2+ succinate → H 2O + fumarate
E°′ = 820 mV – 33 mV = 787 mV
ΔG°′ = –152 kJ/mol

14.1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a cause of pneumonia in
cystic fibrosis patients, oxidizes NADH with nitrate (NO3–) to
nitrite (NO2–) at neutral pH. What is the value of E°′?
14.2 Could a bacterium obtain energy from succinate as an
electron donor with nitrate (NO3–) as an electron acceptor?

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Concentrations of electron donors and acceptors. A high

concentration of an electron donor can enhance metabolism using reactions with small values of E°′. This is particularly common for lithotrophic reactions such as iron
oxidation. The standard reduction potential E°′ assumes
1 M concentrations of reactants and products at 25°C and
pH 7, but actual values of E within cells depend on actual
reactant concentrations.
In Chapter 13 we saw that ΔG includes a term incorporating the ratio of product concentrations (C and D) to
reactant concentrations (A and B):
[C][D]
ΔG = ΔG°′ + 2.303RT log
[A][B]
where R is the gas constant [8.315 joules per kelvin-mole,
or J/(mol · K)], and T is the temperature in kelvins. The
reduction potential E of a redox reaction depends on the
ratio of products to reactants:

where n is the number of electrons transferred and F is

less potential to do work. At moderate temperatures
(25°C–40°C), the constants in the concentration term
(2.303RT/F) combine to yield approximately 60 mV
per electron when there is a tenfold ratio of products to
reactants. Thus, a tenfold ratio of products to reactants
subtracts about 60 mV from E (decreases energy yield),
whereas a tenfold excess of reactants adds 60 mV to E
(increases energy yield).

An ETS Functions within a Membrane

An electron transport system transfers electrons onto
membrane-embedded carriers in a series of increasing
reduction potential, ending at a terminal electron acceptor such as O2, Fe3+, or NO3 –. Some electron transfer
steps yield energy to pump ions across the membrane. To
store this energy, the ETS must maintain an ion gradient
across a membrane that fully separates two aqueous compartments. In bacteria, the cytoplasmic membrane separates the cytoplasm and external medium. Gram-negative
bacteria such as E. coli have their ETS in the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane, which separates the cytoplasm from
the periplasm (see Chapter 3). The Gram-negative outer
membrane surrounding the periplasm is permeable to
protons and other small molecules; thus, the outer membrane does not store energy. Figure 14.3A shows the
inner membrane of Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative
gastric pathogen. The inner membrane contains the ETS

complexes; the cell wall and outer membrane do not participate in respiration.
How do bacteria obtain their electron acceptors? Soluble
electron acceptors such as O2 or NO3 – can reach the cell by
diffusion, but metals such as Fe3+ are stuck within insoluble particles. Metal-reducing bacteria may grow adherent
to particles of iron oxide (recall Geobacter in the Current
Research Highlight). Others secrete organic carrier molecules to dissolve the metal. Still others, such as Shewanella,
form outer membrane nanowire extensions full of extracellular cytochromes. These cytochromes help metal-reducing
bacteria gain access to insoluble minerals—or to the surface
of a fuel-cell electrode (see Special Topic 14.1).
Some respiratory bacteria, such as the nitrite oxidizer
Nitrospira, pack their ETS within intracytoplasmic pockets called “lamellae.” Respiratory membranes similar to
bacterial lamellae are found within our own mitochondria.
Mitochondrial respiration uses only O2 as a terminal electron acceptor. The ETS proteins are embedded in folds of
the mitochondrial inner membrane called “cristae” (singular, crista) (Fig. 14.3B). The inner membrane separates the
inner mitochondrial space from the intermembrane space
(between the inner and outer membranes). The mitochondrial inner membrane, including its electron transport proteins, evolved from the cell membrane of an endosymbiotic
bacterial ancestor. Mitochondrial evolution is discussed
further in Chapter 17.
Electron carrier molecules include proteins and small
organic cofactors bound to the proteins. The protein components of an ETS were first discovered in the 1930s at
Cambridge University by Russian entomologist David Keilin (1887–1963), who studied insect mitochondria. The
mitochondrial inner membranes contain proteins called
cytochromes, which were named for their deep colors,
typically red to brown. The colors derive from absorption
of visible light due to the relatively small energy transitions
of electrons in a cytochrome.
In prokaryotes, cytochromes are often found in the cell
membrane. Figure 14.4 shows the absorbance spectrum
of a cytochrome from the cell membrane of Haloferax volcanii, a halophilic archaeon isolated from the Dead Sea. In
the reduced cytochrome, light absorption peaks in the blue
range (440 nm) and in the orange (607 nm). Upon oxidation, however, the cytochrome loses its absorption peak at
607 nm, and the 440-nm peak shifts to a shorter wavelength. Different species of bacteria make many different
cytochromes, with different absorption peaks, but all cytochromes show spectral changes with a change in reduction
state.
A membrane ETS typically includes several different cytochromes with different reduction potentials. Keilin proposed
that the cytochromes pass electrons sequentially from each
protein complex to the next-stronger electron acceptor, with

each step providing a small amount of energy to the organism (Fig. 14.5). The electron transport proteins are called
oxidoreductases because they oxidize one substrate (removing electrons) and reduce another (donating electrons). Thus,
they couple different half reactions in the electron tower (see
Table 14.1). Oxidoreductases consist of multiprotein complexes that include cytochromes as well as noncytochrome
proteins. The structure and function of ETS oxidoreductase
complexes are discussed in Section 14.3.

The Proton Motive Force

The sequential transfer of electrons from one ETS protein to the next yields energy to pump ions (in most cases
H+) across the membrane. Proton pumping generates a proton motive force (or proton potential) composed of the H+
concentration difference plus the charge difference across the
membrane. The proton motive force (PMF, or Δp) drives many
different cellular processes, such as ATP synthesis and flagellar rotation. In pathogens, the PMF drives drug efflux pumps
that confer resistance to antibiotics such as tetracycline.
Note that in water, H+ never occurs as such, because it
combines with a water molecule to form hydronium ion,
H3O+. Current data, however, are consistent with the
passage of hydrogen nuclei (protons) through the proton pumps of the electron transport system. Within the
pump complex, the proton associates with one chemical
group after another; for example, H+ may combine with
the amine of an amino acid (RNH 2) to form an ammonium ion (RNH3+), and then transfer to a different protonaccepting group within the protein.

Note:

In this book we use “hydrogen ions” and “H+” interchangeably with “protons.”

they did not know how. Most were convinced that electron transport was somehow directly coupled to ATP synthesis. The actual means of coupling was proposed and
demonstrated by one of Keilin’s students—Peter Mitchell
(1920–1992)—and Mitchell’s colleague Jennifer Moyle
(Fig. 14.6A). In 1961, Mitchell proposed an astonishing
explanation for the coupling of electron transport to ATP
synthesis. The chemiosmotic theory states that the energy
from electron transfer between membrane proteins is used
to pump protons across the membrane, accumulating a
higher H+ concentration in the compartment outside. The
pump generates the proton motive force Δp, which stores
energy that can be used to make ATP (Fig. 14.6B).

CHAPTER 14

ELECTRON FLOW IN ORGANOTROPHY, LITHOTROPHY, AND PHOTOTROPHY

Other biologists questioned how a proton potential
could be coupled to ATP synthesis at an enzyme complex
separate from the ETS, at a distant location on the mem-brane. They were skeptical that the H+ concentration gra-dient and charge difference could exist everywhere on thee
membrane separating the two compartments. Because thee
membrane is impermeable to hydrogen ions, the H+ cur-rent can flow back only through a proton-driven complexx
such as the membrane ATP synthase (discussed further in
n
Section 14.3). In effect, the proton potential is a “proton
n
battery,” analogous to the electron potential of an electri-cal battery.
The chemiosmotic theory proved so controversial thatt
Mitchell left Cambridge University to found his own laboratory, Glynn House, where Moyle joined him to test it. A
key requirement was to show that the ETS generates a proton potential. Moyle’s experiment showed that respiration
of mitochondria is associated with proton efflux: Mitochondria isolated from rat livers were exposed to oxygen,
causing efflux of hydrogen ions. The H+ efflux occurred
as electrons were transferred across the ETS and hydrogen ions were expelled by the proton pumps. In Moyle’ss
n
experiments, the number of protons extruded per electron
transferred down the ETS was consistent with the chemi-osmotic model. Similar results were obtained with vesicless
m
made first from mitochondrial membranes and later from
the membranes of chloroplasts and bacteria.
n
A greater challenge was to demonstrate that a proton
d
motive force could, in fact, drive the ATP synthase and
other ion transporters without any undiscovered interme-diate. A friend of Mitchell and Moyle, André Jagendorf, att
Johns Hopkins University, tested the effect of a proton gradient imposed on spinach chloroplasts (Fig. 14.7A). Chloroplasts contain ATP synthase directed outward (that is,
driven by proton flow from inside to outside). The chloroplasts were partly opened by osmotic shock, and then
suspended in medium containing concentrated hydrogen
ions (pH 4). With the osmotic balance restored, the chloroplast membranes closed again, with increased [H+] trapped
inside. When the pH outside was raised to pH 8.3—that
is, lower [H+]—protons from the acidic interior of the vesicles flowed out through the ATP synthase, and ADP and
inorganic phosphate were converted to ATP. Jagendorf
interpreted this result as consistent with the chemiosmotic
theory for the mechanism of phosphorylation.
Other researchers showed that ATP synthesis could be
driven by a charge difference across a vesicle membrane
(Fig. 14.7B). An artificial electrical potential (Δψ) was
applied by loading vesicles with potassium ions (K+). The
potassium ions were conducted across the membrane by
the ionophore valinomycin, a small cyclic peptide that
binds to an ion and solubilizes it in the membrane. Valinomycin specifically binds K+, while its hydrophobic side

For cells grown at neutral pH, all three
terms (Δp, Δψ, and –60ΔpH) usually
have a negative value, meaning that their
force drives protons inward from outside.
In living cells, the relative contributions of Δψ and –60ΔpH vary depending on other sources of charge difference
and protons, as shown in Figure 14.8.
Both the Δψ and ΔpH components of Δp
are influenced by other factors besides
ETS proton transport. For example:
■

Cytoplasm

FIGURE 14.8

■ Electrical potential and pH difference. Proton motive force drives
protons into the cell (arrow). A. The proton motive force Δp is composed of the transmembrane electrical potential Δψ (the charge difference), plus the transmembrane pH difference
ΔpH (the chemical concentration gradient of H+). B. If the pH inside and outside the cell is
equal, then Δp = Δψ. C. If the electrical charge inside and out is equal, then Δp = –60ΔpH.

Δ p Includes Δψ and ΔpH

The transfer of H+ through a proton pump generates a H+
concentration difference across the membrane. Since H+ carries a positive charge, the proton transfer also generates a
charge difference across the membrane. The H+ concentration difference (ΔpH) plus the charge difference (Δψ) make
a proton potential (Δp), also called a proton motive force
(PMF).
Thus, when protons are pumped across the membrane,
the proton motive force stores energy in two different
forms—the separation of charge, or electrical potential,
and the gradient of H+ concentration, or pH difference—
as shown in Figure 14.7. Either form (or both) can drive
Δp-dependent cell processes:
■

■

The electrical potential (Δψ) arises from the separation
of charge between the cytoplasm (more negative) and
the solution outside the cell membrane (more positive).
For many bacteria, this “battery” potential is about –50
to –150 mV.
The pH difference (ΔpH) is the difference between
internal and external pH [pH(in) – pH(out)]. For example, if the bacterial internal pH is 7.5 and the external pH
is 6.5, the ΔpH is 1.0, and the ratio of [H+]out to [H+]in
is 10. A ΔpH of 1.0 corresponds to a proton potential of
approximately –60 mV when the temperature is 25°C.

The relationship between electrical and chemical components of the proton potential Δp (in mV) is given by:
Δp = Δψ – (2.3RT/F)ΔpH
or approximately:
Δp = Δψ – 60ΔpH

The charge difference Δψ includes
charges on other ions, such as K+
and Na+. These ions are pumped or
exchanged by ion-specific membrane
transport proteins.

The pH difference ΔpH is affected by
metabolic generation of acids, such as
fermentation acids, or by pH changes
outside the cell. Permeant acids can run down the gradient
through the membrane, collapsing the ΔpH to zero.
■

Overall, the cell uses its various membrane pumps and
metabolic pathways to adjust and maintain its proton
motive force at a size sufficient to drive ATP synthesis but
not so great as to disrupt the membrane.

Thought Questions

14.3 What do you think happens to Δψ as the cell’s external
pH increases or decreases? What could happen to the Δp of
bacteria that are swallowed and enter the extremely acidic
stomach?

14.4 How could a simple experiment provide evidence that

a proton pump in the bacterial cell membrane drives efflux of
antibiotics such as tetracycline?

What about other ions, such as the sodium ions in Figure 14.8? Can a sodium gradient drive cell processes? For
some bacteria, a gradient of Na+ concentration can drive
transport of a nutrient through a transporter protein embedded in the cell membrane. Bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae
(the cause of cholera) can use a Na+ concentration gradient
to power ATP synthesis by a Na+-dependent ATP synthase.
Dissipation of proton motive force. What happens if something disrupts the membrane so that protons leak through?
Even a small leak can quickly dissipate all the energy stored
as ΔpH.
Many fermentation products are weak acids, such as acetic
acid, whose protonated form can dissolve in the membrane and

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

The Respiratory ETS
and ATP Synthase

We now discuss the carrier molecules and proteins that
comprise the electron transport system (ETS) of oxidative
respiration. For aerobic bacteria, and for the mitochondrial
inner membrane, the respiratory ETS receives electrons
from NADH and FADH 2 and transfers electrons ultimately to O2, producing H 2O. In between, the series of
membrane-embedded carriers harvests the reducing potential of electrons in small steps.

ETS proteins such as cytochromes associate electron transfer with small, reversible energy transitions. The energy
transitions are mediated by cofactors, small molecules that
associate with the protein. Figure 14.11 shows the protein
structure of a cytochrome from the pathogen Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. The protein, cytochrome c, transfers electrons
for nitrate respiration. Its reddish color derives from the
buried cofactor called heme, a ring of conjugated double
bonds surrounding an iron ion (Fe2+ or Fe3+). The heme
plays a key role in acquiring and transferring electrons,
with an Fe2+/Fe3+ transition. A metal-reducing bacterium
such as Geobacter may make over a hundred different types
of cytochromes in its envelope, where electrons accumulate
until the bacterium finds an oxidant to accept them.

Cofactors such as heme allow small, reversible redox
changes. Other examples include flavin mononucleotide
(FMN) and ubiquinone (Fig. 14.12). The structure of
each cofactor must allow transition of an electron between
closely spaced energy levels to avoid “spending it all in one
place.” If all of the energy were spent in one transition,
most of it would be lost as heat instead of being converted
to several small processes, such as pumping H+ across the
membrane.
Small energy transitions typically involve these kinds of
molecular structures:

■

Metal ions such as iron or copper, coordinated (and
hence held in place) with amino acid residues. Iron is

often coordinated by sulfur atoms of cysteine residues
in the protein; examples shown in Figure 14.12B are
[2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S]. Transition metals make useful
electron carriers because their outer electron shell has
several closely spaced energy levels, facilitating small
energy transitions.
■

Conjugated double bonds and heteroaromatic rings,
such as the nicotinamide ring of NAD+/NADH, also
provide narrowly spaced energy transitions. Membranesoluble carriers such as quinones (reduced to quinols)
allow even smaller energy transitions than does NAD+/
NADH.

The major protein complexes of electron transport
each have one or more redox centers containing either
metal ions or conjugated double bonds or both. In FMN,
the conjugated double bonds allow a small energy transition (Fig. 14.12A). In iron-sulfur clusters—[2Fe-2S] and
[4Fe-4S]—the metal atoms provide the site for a small
energy transition, its size dependent on the cluster’s connections within the associated protein (Fig. 14.12B). The
heme group found in cytochromes and other oxidoreductases contains extensive conjugated double bonds, coordinated around the metal Fe3+ (Fig. 14.12C). Reduction
by a transferred electron converts the iron to Fe2+. The
branching of side chains on the ring varies among different
hemes, altering the magnitude of E°′ for the redox couple
Fe3+/Fe2+.
Some electron carriers are small molecules that associate loosely with a protein complex and then come off to
diffuse freely within the membrane. Mobile electron carriers include quinones such as ubiquinone (Fig. 14.12D),
which can be reduced to quinols:
Q + 2H+ + 2e – → QH 2
Quinols carry electrons and protons laterally within the
membrane between the proton-pumping protein complexes
of the ETS. The hydrophobic quinols never leave the membrane; thus their electrons are kept in the membrane until
transfer out of the ETS. After transferring their electrons
to the next protein complex, quinols revert to quinones,
capable of accepting electrons again.

Note:

Dehydrogenases, reductases, and oxidases are all oxidoreductases, which oxidize one substrate (remove electrons) and
reduce another (donate electrons). Oxidoreductases that accept
electrons from NADH or FADH2 are also called dehydrogenases,
because their reaction releases hydrogen ions.

Oxidoreductase Protein Complexes

A respiratory electron transport system includes at least three
functional components: an initial substrate oxidoreductase

(or dehydrogenase), a mobile electron carrier, and a terminal oxidase. Microbes make alternative versions of each
component using alternative electron-donating substrates
and terminal electron acceptors, depending on what is
available in the environment. Here we present a typical bacterial ETS receiving electrons from NADH and transferring them to oxygen.
Initial substrate oxidoreductase. A respiratory ETS begins
with an initial oxidoreductase that receives a pair of electrons from an organic substrate such as NADH. Note
that NADH forms by receiving two electrons plus 2H+
from an organic product of catabolism (designated RH 2)
(Fig. 14.13A). The 2H+ are ultimately balanced by 2H+
from the cytoplasm combining with O2 (or another terminal electron acceptor) at the end of the ETS. The two
electrons (2e –) from NADH enter an ETS protein complex
embedded in the membrane.
NADH donates electrons to NADH dehydrogenase
(NADH:quinone oxidoreductase, NDH-1) (Fig. 14.13A).
In bacteria, the NDH-1 complex includes 14 different subunits. The NDH-1 complex includes the cofactor FMN,
as well as several iron-sulfur clusters—typically 7[4Fe-4S]
and 2[2Fe-2S]. The cofactors “hand off” electrons to each
other through adjacent connections; see, for example, the
placement of FMN and the first [4Fe-4S] within the peptide coils of NDH-1 (Fig. 14.13B). Each electron from
NADH travels through FMN and the iron-sulfur series.
At the end of the chain, the electrons and 2H+ from solution are transferred to a quinone, which is thus reduced to
a quinol. Quinones are designated Q; and quinols, QH 2.
Within the NDH-1 complex, the oxidation of NADH
and reduction of Q to QH 2 yields energy to pump up to
4H+ across the membrane. A crystallographic model shows
four apparent proton channels through transmembrane
alpha helices of the protein subunits (Fig. 14.13A). Within
each channel, a hydrogen ion hops along a series of amino
acid residues. The H+ translocation is driven by a conformational change in the alpha helices throughout the protein,
arising from the initial two-electron reduction by NADH.
The hydrogen ions pumped across the membrane contribute to the proton potential Δp. In human mitochondria,
the NADH dehydrogenase (aka “complex I”) is critical for
health; genetic defects in complex I are associated with diseases such as Parkinson’s and some forms of diabetes.
Note that the 4H+ pumped across the membrane are distinct from the 2H+ acquired by the quinone (Q → QH 2).
In some halophilic bacteria, 4Na+ are pumped instead
of 4H+.

Note:

In our figures, protons that cross the membrane by the
end of the ETS (and thus contribute to Δp) are highlighted yellow.

quinone can receive
2e – from the substrate oxidoreductase,
Q H2
along with 2H+ from solution, to balance
the negative charges, yielding a quinol
(Fig. 14.13A). The quinols diffuse within
the membrane and carry reduction energy to
other ETS components. After transferring
2e – to the next protein complex, 2H+ are
released. Usually the 2H+ released are on the
opposite side of the membrane from where
2H+ were originally picked up (Fig. 14.14).
Thus, besides electron transfer, a quinol may
contribute two protons to the transmembrane proton potential. The reoxidized carriers then recycle back as quinones.
Each quinone can bind to a substrate
dehydrogenase, pick up a pair of electrons and
hydrogen ions, and then diffuse away and carry the electrons to a reductase. The quinones and quinols, referred to
as the quinone pool, diffuse freely within the membrane.
Thus, the quinones/quinols are able to transfer electrons
between many different redox enzymes.
Different oxidoreductase complexes interact with slightly
different quinones, such as ubiquinone and menaquinone.
The reduction potentials of ubiquinone and menaquinone
are given in Table 14.1. For clarity, this chapter refers to
all of them as quinones (Q), and their reduced forms as
quinols (QH 2).

Not all substrate oxidoreductases pump protons. For
example, E. coli has an alternative NADH dehydrogenase
(NDH-2) that transfers two electrons to Q without pumping additional protons across the membrane. (The unused
energy is lost as heat.) NDH-2 functions during rapid
growth, when the cell must limit its proton potential to
avoid membrane breakdown. Other complexes, such as succinate dehydrogenase, transfer electrons from substrates

trons from a quinol (QH 2) and transfers them to a terminal
electron acceptor, such as O2 (Fig. 14.14). The complex
usually includes a cytochrome that accepts electrons from
quinols. Cytochromes of comparable function are designated by letters—for example, cytochrome b (E. coli and
mitochondria) and cytochrome c (mitochondria). The cytochrome is bound to an oxidase complex containing a series
of electron-transferring carriers: two iron-centered hemes
and three copper atoms. This unique center couples electron transfer and proton pumping.
The E. coli cytochrome bo quinol oxidase consists of cytochrome b plus oxidase complex o. The cytochrome b subunit
receives two electrons from a quinol (QH2 → Q) and releases
the 2H+ out to the periplasm. Each electron from quinol travels through the two hemes of the oxidase complex. Because
the two quinol hydrogens originated from 2H+ in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 14.13) and 2H+ were released outside by a
quinol, there is net efflux of 2H+. In addition, the transfer of
2e – between the two oxidase hemes is coupled to pumping
2H+ from the cytoplasm across to the periplasm (Fig. 14.14).

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

at least three phases of electron transfer, such as: (1) NADH
from an organic substrate donates electrons to an initial oxidoreductase; (2) the electrons are transferred to a quinone,
which is reduced to a quinol; (3) the quinol transfers electrons
to a terminal oxidase and releases 2H+ outside the cell. Both
enzymes and quinones show considerable complexity and
diversity among different species in different environments.
The entering carrier NADH carries two electrons with
protons obtained from catabolized food molecules. The two
electrons (2e –) from NDH-1 and two protons (2H+) from
solution are transferred onto Q (quinone), converting it to
QH 2 (quinol). The transfer of 2e – from NADH yields sufficient energy to pump as many as 4H+ across the membrane.
The exact number depends on cell conditions, such as the
concentrations of NADH and the terminal electron acceptor.
The QH 2 diffuses within the membrane until it reaches
a terminal oxidase complex, such as the cytochrome bo
quinol oxidase. The 2H+ from QH 2 are released outside
the cell, while the 2e – enter the oxidase, reducing the two
hemes. The two electrons join 2H+ from the cytoplasm,
combining with an oxygen atom to make H 2O. The reaction is coupled to pumping of 2H+ across the membrane
plus a net increase of 2H+ outside through redox reactions.
Overall, the oxidation of NADH exports about 8H+ per
–
2e transferred through the ETS to make H 2O. The export
of protons generates a proton potential Δp.

Note:

Protons (hydrogen ions, H+) can have three different
fates in the ETS:
1. Protons are pumped across the membrane (H+) by an oxidoreductase complex. Contributes to Δp.
2. Protons are consumed from the cytoplasm by quinone/quinol,
while other protons are released outside the membrane (H+).
Contributes to Δp.
3. Protons are consumed by combining with the terminal electron
acceptor (O2). If the loss balances protons released by catabolism, it does not affect Δp.

Thought Questions

14.6 In Figure 14.15, what is the advantage of the oxidore-

ductase transferring electrons to a pool of mobile quinones,
which then reduce the terminal reductase (cytochrome
complex)? Why does each oxidoreductase not interact directly
with a cytochrome complex?

14.7 In Figure 14.15, why are most electron transport proteins fixed within the cell membrane? What would happen if
they “got loose” in aqueous solution?

Environmental modulation of the ETS. The ETS just

described represents optimal conditions, when food and
oxygen are unlimited. What happens when food (that is,

electron donors) or oxygen is scarce? When the environment changes, bacteria adjust the efficiency of their ETS by
expressing alternative oxidoreductases. For example, at low
concentrations of oxygen (microaerophilic conditions, discussed in Chapter 5) the reduction potential E is decreased.
So the ETS may be unable to reduce O2 to H 2O while
pumping four protons. Instead, E. coli uses a different cytochrome quinol oxidase that has higher affi nity for oxygen
but pumps fewer protons. Thus, the bacteria will gain less
energy, but they will still be able to grow. Environmental
regulation of ETS is discussed further in eTopic 14.1.
Bacteria also have alternative oxidoreductases to serve
different electron donors and acceptors. Some enzymes take
electrons from donors lacking the potential of NADH; for
example, succinate dehydrogenase catalyzes the one step
of the TCA cycle that yields FADH 2 —a step that provides
not quite enough energy to produce NADH (discussed
in Chapter 13). Succinate dehydrogenase is the only TCA
enzyme embedded in the membrane as an ETS component. When O2 concentration is so low as to be thermodynamically unavailable, some bacteria can use other electron
acceptors, such as nitrate (anaerobic respiration, discussed in
Section 14.4). Yet another alternative is to oxidize inorganic
electron donors (lithotrophy, discussed in Section 14.5).
Mitochondrial respiration. In contrast to E. coli, mito-

chondria have only a single ETS, optimized for a relatively
uniform intracellular environment (Fig. 14.16). Protected
by the eukaryotic cytoplasm, mitochondria do not need to
use alternative versions of their ETS to respire under different conditions. Instead, a set of just four electron-carrying
complexes has evolved so as to maximize the energy
obtained from NADH, minimizing energy lost as heat.
This mitochondrial ETS is nearly universal throughout
the cells of animals, plants, and most eukaryotic microbes.
In addition, some bacteria, such as Paracoccus denitrificans, have an ETS whose organization resembles that of
mitochondria.
The mitochondrial ETS has homologs (proteins encoded
by genes with a common ancestor) of bacterial ETS components, including NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and cytochrome c oxidase. However, the mitochondrial
ETS differs from that of E. coli in these respects:

An intermediate cytochrome oxidase complex
transfers electrons. Besides NADH dehydrogenase
(complex I) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV),
mitochondria show an intermediate step of electron
transfer to ubiquinol:cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III, shown in Fig. 14.16). The intermediate electron
transfer step pumps an additional 2H+. Another 2e – and
2H+ come from succinate dehydrogenase (complex II),
which forms FADH2 through the TCA cycle.

The Proton Potential
Drives ATP Synthase

The proton potential drives synthesis of ATP by the membrane ATP synthase, also known as the F1Fo ATP synthase. The proton-driven synthesis of ATP completes the
cycle of oxidative phosphorylation, in which hydrogen
ions pumped by the ETS drive phosphorylation of ADP to
ATP by the ATP synthase. The same ATP synthase can
use the proton potential generated by lithotrophy (see
Section 14.5) or by phototrophy (Section 14.6). Surprisingly, despite the homology of ATP synthase across all
forms of life, the complex is a target for antibiotics. For
example, the ATP synthase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
the cause of tuberculosis, is inhibited specifically by bedaquiline, an antibiotic approved in 2012 for patients whose
disease resists all other drugs.
The F1Fo ATP synthase is a protein complex highly conserved in the bacterial cell membrane, the mitochondrial
inner membrane, and the chloroplast thylakoid membrane.
An elegant molecular machine, the ATP synthase is composed of two complexes—Fo and F1—that rotate relative

plus a beta subunit) interconverts ADP + Pi with ATP +
H 2O. The gamma subunit connects the tripartite “knob”
of F1 to the membrane-embedded Fo. Proton transport
through Fo drives ATP synthesis by F1.
One proton at a time enters the subunit-a channel and
moves into a c subunit of Fo (Fig. 14.18 ). The proton potential directed inward ensures that protons more
often enter from the outside than from the cytoplasm.
Each entering proton causes a c subunit to rotate around
the axle, with release of a bound proton to the cytoplasm.
The flux of three protons through Fo is coupled to forming
one molecule of ATP by one alpha-beta-gamma unit of F1.
During each cycle generating ATP, the ring of c subunits of
the Fo rotor rotates in the membrane one-third of one turn
relative to the F1 in the cytoplasm.
Note that the generation of ATP is completely reversible, so ATP hydrolysis by F1 can pump protons back
through Fo across the membrane. In the absence of a proton potential, a high ATP concentration can drive the Fo in
reverse, actually pumping protons to generate Δp. This
reversal of ATP synthase is used, for example, by Enterococcus faecalis, intestinal Gram-positive cocci that generate
ATP mainly by fermentation. E. faecalis can operate the

membrane-embedded F1Fo ATP synthase in reverse, consuming ATP and thus generating a proton potential for
nutrient uptake and ion transport.

Thought Question

14.8 Would E. coli be able to grow in the presence of an

uncoupler that eliminates the proton potential supporting ATP
synthesis?

Na+ Pumps: An Alternative to H+ Pumps

While a proton potential provides primary energy storage for
most species, some bacteria generate an additional potential
of sodium ions. A sodium motive force (ΔNa+) is analogous
to the proton motive force in that it includes the electrical potential Δψ plus the sodium ion concentration gradient (log ratio of the Na+ concentration difference across the
membrane). For extreme halophilic archaea, which grow in
concentrated NaCl, the sodium potential entirely substitutes for the proton potential to drive ATP synthesis. These
“haloarchaea” make use of the high external Na+ concentration to store energy in the form of a sodium potential.

CHAPTER 14

■

ELECTRON FLOW IN ORGANOTROPHY, LITHOTROPHY, AND PHOTOTROPHY

In some bacteria, an ETS oxidoreductase pumps Na+
instead of H+. For example, the proton-pumping NADH
dehydrogenase can be supplemented by an NADH dehydrogenase that pumps Na+ out of the cell. This primary
sodium pump is found in many pathogens, including
Vibrio cholerae (the cause of cholera) and Yersinia pestis
(the cause of bubonic plague). These pathogens use the
sodium-rich blood plasma to store energy in a sodium
potential.

Protons are consumed by combining with the terminal electron acceptor, such as combining with oxygen to

The proton potential drives ATP synthesis through
the membrane-embedded F1Fo ATP synthase. Three

of ATP. Some bacteria use a similar ATP synthase driven

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

(see Table 14.1). In a given environment, bacteria use the
strongest electron donor and the strongest electron acceptor
available. The best donor and best acceptor usually induce
the expression of genes encoding their respective redox
enzymes. For example, in the presence of nitrate, genes
encoding nitrate reductase are expressed. At the same time,
nitrate represses the expression of reductases for poorer electron acceptors, such as fumarate. (The mechanisms of gene
induction and repression are discussed in Chapter 10.)

Oxidized Forms of Nitrogen

Respiration using oxidized forms of nitrogen is widespread among bacteria and archaea. Most eukaryotes must
breathe oxygen, but some eukaryotic microbes respire on
nitrate and nitrite. In anaerobic soil, many yeasts and filamentous fungi can reduce nitrate to nitrite, and nitrite to
nitrous oxide.
The nitrogen series offers an abundant source of strong
electron acceptors. Reduction of oxidized states of nitrogen
for energy yield is called dissimilatory denitrification. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) contributes to respiration, whereas assimilatory reduction of nitrate
generates ammonium ion for fixation into biomass (discussed
in Chapters 15 and 22). Some pathogens are dissimilatory
denitrifiers, such as Neisseria meningitidis (a cause of meningitis) and Brucella species that cause brucellosis in cattle,
sheep, and dogs. In the dissimilatory nitrogen redox series,
a given oxidation state can serve as an acceptor in one redox
couple but as a donor in the next. The redox couples are summarized here:

Each nitrogen state requires a specialized reductase, such
as nitrate reductase or nitrite reductase, to receive electrons from the ETS. During the reactions, oxygen atoms
are removed and combined with protons to form water.
The full series of nitrate reduction to N2 plays a crucial role
in producing the nitrogen gas of Earth’s atmosphere (discussed in Chapter 22).
An alternative option for many soil bacteria, such as
Bacillus species, is to reduce nitrite to ammonium ion
(NH4+):
NO2 – + 8H+ + 6e – → NH4+ + 2H 2O
Dissimilatory nitrate and nitrite reduction to ammonium
ion can increase the soil pH. The high pH will precipitate
metals such as iron.
The presence of a particular reductase can be used as
a diagnostic indicator for clinical isolates of bacteria. For

example, the chemical test for nitrate reduction is a key
step in the diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative
agent of gonorrhea. N. gonorrhoeae happens to lack the terminal reductase for nitrate; hence, it tests negative, whereas
several closely related species test positive.

Oxidized Forms of Sulfur

The redox potentials for sulfur oxyanions are generally lower
than those for oxidized nitrogen. Nevertheless, with the
appropriate oxidoreductases, sulfate and sulfite receive electrons from many kinds of electron donors, including acetate, hydrocarbons, and H 2. Sulfate-reducing bacteria and
archaea are widespread in the ocean, from the Arctic waters
to submarine thermal vents. The ubiquity of sulfate reduction may be related to the high sulfate content of seawater,
in which SO42– is the most common anion after chloride.
The major oxidized forms of sulfur that serve as bacterial electron acceptors include:

A surprising use of a sulfur oxyanion by a pathogen is tetrathionate respiration by Salmonella enterica (Fig. 14.20).
When S. enterica infects the gut epithelium, it induces host
inflammation and activates white blood cells (discussed in
Chapter 25). Salmonella catabolizes amino acids, releasing hydrogen sulfide (H 2S), which becomes oxidized to
thiosulfate (S2O32–). White blood cells called neutrophils
attempt to kill the bacteria by secreting toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), or oxidants. The ROS convert thiosulfate to tetrathionate (S 4O62–). But, surprisingly, S. enterica
can use tetrathionate as a terminal electron acceptor for its
ETS to yield energy. With this extra energy source unavailable to competitors, the pathogenic S. enterica can outgrow
the host’s native microbiome and cause disease.

Dissimilatory Metal Reduction

An important class of anaerobic respiration involves the
reduction of metal cations, or dissimilatory metal reduction. The term “dissimilatory” indicates that the metal
reduced as a terminal electron acceptor is excluded from the
cell. This is in contrast to minerals reduced for the purpose
of incorporation into cell components (assimilatory metal
reduction). Metal-reducing bacteria such as Geobacter or
Shewanella offer the intriguing prospect of making electricity in a fuel cell (Special Topic 14.1). The metals most
commonly reduced through anaerobic respiration are iron
(Fe3+ → Fe2+) and manganese (Mn4+ → Mn2+), but virtually any metal with multiple redox states can be reduced

such as those of Shewanella (seen earlier, in Fig. 14.2).

consumed, in turn, by species that have the terminal oxidases

or oxidized by some bacteria. For example, Geobacter can
reduce uranium (U6+ → U4+) to respire on acetate. Reduced
uranium is insoluble in water, precipitating as uranite (UO2).
Thus, Geobacter respiration with uranium can remediate uranium-contaminated water. The U.S. Department of
Energy used uranium-reducing bacteria for remediation at
Rifle, Colorado, where uranium contamination threatened
the Colorado River. In this process, acetate is pumped into
the water table, where G. metallireducens oxidizes the acetate
to CO2 by reducing U6+ to U4+. The reduced uranium then
precipitates out of the water into the soil, where it can be collected and removed, while the cleansed water flows through.
Metal electron acceptors require a specific oxidoreductase
(or reductase). Metal ions in solution interact directly with
reductases, but oxidized metals such as Fe3+ are often barely
soluble in water. How does a bacterial reductase interact with
an insoluble source of metal outside the cell? Soil bacteria
may “shuttle” electrons to extracellular metals using quinone-like degradation products of lignin, a complex aromatic
substance that forms the bulk of wood and woody stems. Lignin degradation products are also called “humics” because
of their presence in humus, the organic components of soil
(discussed in Chapter 21). Humics accumulate in anaerobic
environments, where decomposition is slow. Alternatively,
bacteria may contact insoluble metals using surface-bound

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

SPECIAL TOPIC 14.1(( Bacterial Electric Power
In natural biofilms, bacteria transfer electrons to metals and
even between neighboring bacteria. What if we could harness bacterial electron transfer to power our own electrical
devices? Kenneth Nealson (Fig. 1A) and students at the University of Southern California are trying to do just that.
The concept of bacterial electric power is surprisingly
recent. Up to 20 years ago, it was thought that bacteria could
reduce only soluble ions such as nitrate. But Nealson, like the
famous nineteenth-century microbial ecologist Sergei Winogradsky, was fascinated by the metal transformations he
observed in wetlands and lake sediments. Nealson was particularly intrigued by the high levels of reduced manganese (Mn2+)
found in Lake Oneida, New York. He reasoned that only microbial activity could account for so much reduced manganese,
compared to other lakes where manganese is in the oxidized
form (Mn4+, as the insoluble mineral MnO2). In 1988, Nealson
and his colleague Charles Myers discovered a bacterium that
could respire anaerobically by donating electrons to MnO2,
releasing soluble Mn2+. The bacterium, named Shewanella
oneidensis MR-1 (for “manganese reducer”) contains a large
number of different cytochromes. The cytochromes help the
bacterium donate electrons to different kinds of metals, even
insoluble forms such as iron and cobalt embedded within clay.
How can bacteria reduce a substance outside their cell
envelopes? Nealson’s colleague Mohamed El-Naggar found
that Shewanella bacteria transfer electrons via nanowires (see
Fig. 14.2). The nanowire extensions of periplasm help bacteria connect with each other in a biofilm, and transfer a current to the metal electron acceptor. In an electrolytic fuel cell,
the bacteria form a biofilm on the anode (electron-attracting
electrode) (Fig. 1B). As the bacteria oxidize organic fuel, they
cause charge separation between electrons and hydrogen
ions. The electrons then pass within a current to the cathode.

to use them. For example, as oxygen grows scarce, denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas (NO3 – → N2). As
nitrate is used up, other species reduce manganese (Mn4+ →
Mn2+), iron (Fe3+ → Fe2+), and sulfate (SO42– → H 2S). At
the bottom of the lake or sediment, methanogenic archaea
reduce carbon dioxide to methane (see Section 14.5). Microbial reduction of minerals plays a critical role in every ecosystem and participates in the geochemical cycling of elements
throughout Earth’s biosphere (discussed in Chapter 22).

Thought Question

14.9 The proposed scheme for uranium removal requires
injection of acetate under highly anoxic conditions, with less
than 1 part per million (ppm) dissolved oxygen. Why must the
acetate be anoxic?

The “fuel” for the cell can be a mixture of organic substances derived from any kind of food waste or sewage.
Organic waste includes small organic molecules such as lactate, acetate, and even formaldehyde. The biofilm bacteria
on the anode can remove hydrogens from these organic molecules, separating the electrons and hydrogen ions (Fig. 1C).
The hydrogen ions migrate through a polymer membrane,
whereas the electrons enter the anode leading to an electrical wire. The remaining carbon and oxygen atoms of the fuel
are released as CO2. The process is similar to natural respiration, except that instead of molecular oxygen, the electron
acceptor is an electrode made of graphite. To complete the
circuit, the electrons from the wire current ultimately react
with oxygen and hydrogen ions to form water, as in aerobic
respiration.
So far, microbial fuel cells have been able to generate milliamps of current, enough to drive small devices, such as clocks
and marine data sensors. Microbial fuel cells offer a clean way
to make electricity, with inexpensive fuel. The main challenge
is generating larger currents. Many researchers are working to
ramp up the currents and make the dream of bacterial electricity a reality.

Anaerobic terminal electron acceptors, such as nitrogen and sulfur oxyanions, oxidized metal cations, and

Nitrate is successively reduced by bacteria to nitrite, nitric

Sulfate is successively reduced by bacteria to sulfite,
thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, and hydrogen sulfide. Sulfate reducers are especially prevalent in seawater.

Many reduced minerals and single-carbon compounds can
serve as electron donors for an ETS, in the energy-yielding
form of metabolism known as lithotrophy (or chemolithotrophy). Some organotrophs have alternative oxidoreductases that conduct lithotrophy by oxidizing H 2 or Fe2+;

oxidizes hydrogen gas released by mixed-acid-fermenting
bacteria in the colon. Other bacteria are “obligate lithotrophs”; that is, they oxidize only inorganic molecules.
All lithotrophs are bacteria or archaea. Thus, bacteria and
archaea fill many key niches in ecosystems that eukaryotes
cannot.
Lithotrophy includes many kinds of electron donors,
from metals and anions to single-carbon groups
(Table 14.2). Each type of electron donor, such as H 2,
NH4+, or Fe2+, requires a specialized electron-accepting
oxidoreductase. Most inorganic substrates other than H 2
are relatively poor electron donors compared to organic
donors such as glucose. Therefore, the terminal electron
acceptor is usually a strong oxidant, such as O2, NO3 –, or
Fe3+. Obligate lithotrophs (organisms that conduct only
lithotrophy) consume no organic carbon source; they build
biomass by fixing CO2 (a process discussed in Chapter 15).

Reduced metal ions such as Fe and Mn provide energy
through oxidation by O2 or NO3 –. Bacteria perform these
lithotrophic reactions in soil where weathering exposes
reduced minerals. They generate metal ions with higher
oxidation states (such as Fe3+ or Mn4+), which other bacteria use for anaerobic respiration. Environments such
as ponds and wetlands that experience frequent shifts
between oxygen availability and oxygen depletion are
likely to host a variety of metal-oxidizing lithotrophs,
as well as metal-reducing anaerobic heterotrophs. The
roles of lithotrophy in ecology are discussed further in
Chapters 21 and 22.
An example of lithotrophy is iron oxidation by the bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Fig. 14.22). These
bacteria oxidize Fe2+ (ferrous ion) using the reduction
potential between Fe3+/Fe2+ and O2/H 2O:
E°′ (pH 2)
2Fe2+ → 2Fe3+ + 2e– (pH 2)
½O2 + 2H+ + 2e– → H2O (pH 2)
2Fe2+ + ½O2 + 2H+ → 2Fe3+ + H2O

G°′ (pH 2)

–(+770) mV

+149 kJ/mol

+1,100 mV

–212 kJ/mol

+330 mV

–63 kJ/mol

The removal of electrons from Fe2+ requires an input of
energy, which is compensated for by the larger yield of
energy from reducing oxygen to water. The net reduction
potential is small; thus, A. ferrooxidans must cycle large
quantities of iron in order to grow. Because the reaction
consumes H+, it goes forward only at low pH, such as
that of acid mine drainage where other microbes oxidize
sulfur to sulfuric acid. The bacterial cell must keep its
cytoplasmic pH considerably higher (pH 6.5) by transmembrane exchange of H+ with cations, and inverting

the electrical potential Δψ (positive inside). Thus, the
proton potential Δp exists entirely in the form of ΔpH.
The ∆pH drives ATP synthesis.
Unlike organic electron donors, metals such as iron
must be accessed from insoluble particles outside the cell.
In A. ferrooxidans, the electrons are collected from iron
outside by an outer membrane cytochrome c 2. The cytochrome is associated with a periplasmic protein called rusticyanin. Rusticyanin collects electrons while excluding the
potentially toxic metal from the cell. The electrons from
rusticyanin can be transferred to an inner membrane cytochrome complex that reduces oxygen to water.
For iron oxidation, the ΔG of reaction is too small to
pump protons. So how do cells obtain enough energy to
form NADPH for biosynthesis? An alternative pathway
directs electrons to an enzyme complex that uses proton
influx (spends Δp) to convert NADP+ to NADPH. This
pathway is called reverse electron flow, because it reverses
the flux of electrons seen in an ETS that spends NADH
(or NADPH) to form NAD+ (or NADP+). In reverse electron flow, a relatively poor electron donor (such as 2Fe2+)
reduces an ETS with an unfavorable reduction potential,
requiring input of energy to generate NADH or NADPH.
For iron oxidation, the energy input comes from the large
ΔpH across the inner membrane (pH 6.5 inside, and pH
2 outside). Reverse electron flow is seen in some kinds of
lithotrophy, in syntrophy (discussed in Chapter 13), and in
phototrophy (discussed in Section 14.6).

Nitrogen Oxidation

One kind of lithotrophy essential for the environment is
oxidation of nitrogen compounds:
½O2

NH4+ → NH 2OH → HNO2 → HNO3
Ammonium

Hydroxylamine

Nitrous acid
(nitrite)

Nitric acid
(nitrate)

Reduced forms of nitrogen, such as ammonium ion
derived from fertilizers, support growth of nitrifiers, bacteria that generate nitrites or nitrates (forming nitrous acid
or nitric acid, respectively). Acid production can degrade
environmental quality. In soil treated with artificial fertilizers, nitrifiers decrease the ammonium ions obtained from
such fertilizer and produce toxic concentrations of nitrites,
which leach into groundwater. Still, nitrifiers can be useful
in sewage treatment, where they eliminate ammonia that
would harm aquatic life (discussed in Chapter 22).
Ammonia/ammonium and nitrite are relatively poor
electron donors compared to organic molecules. Thus, their

oxidation through the ETS pumps fewer protons, and the
bacteria must cycle relatively large quantities of substrates
to grow. As we saw for iron oxidation, reduced cofactors
such as NADPH must be obtained through reverse electron flow involving redox carriers with different amounts
of energy.
What happens to ammonium ion from detritus that
accumulates in anaerobic regions, such as the bottom of a
lake? Surprisingly, NH4+ can yield energy through oxidation by nitrite (a product of nitrate respiration):
NH4+ + NO2 – → N2 + 2H 2O

ΔG°′ = –357 kJ/mol

Under conditions of high ammonium and extremely
low oxygen, nitrite oxidation of ammonium ion supports growth of bacteria. Known as the anammox reaction, anaerobic ammonium oxidation plays a major role
in wastewater treatment, where it eliminates much of the
ammonium ion from sewage breakdown. In the oceans,
anammox bacteria cycle as much as half of all the nitrogen
gas returned to the atmosphere.

is reduced by NH4+ to form hydrazine (N2H4). Hydrazine is
a toxic molecule that gets trapped in the anammoxosome
by the membrane composed of ladderanes. Hydrazine donates electrons to reduce nitrite, and gives off N2. Protons
may be pumped by the hydrazine synthase complex.

Anammox is conducted by planctomycetes, irregularly
shaped bacteria with unusual membranous organelles
that fill much of the cell (Fig. 14.23A). The central compartment is called the anammoxosome. The anammoxosome membrane is composed of unusual ladder-shaped
lipids called ladderanes. An enzyme of the anammoxosomal membrane reduces nitrite to NO plus H 2O
(Fig. 14.23B, step 1). Another membrane-embedded
enzyme, hydrazine synthase, catalyzes NO reduction by
NH4+ to form hydrazine (N2H4) (step 2). Hydrazine is
a high-energy compound that engineers use for rocket
fuel; the substance is highly toxic, so the planctomycete
keeps it sequestered within the specialized anammoxosome membrane.
The hydrazine is further oxidized to N2 (Fig. 14.23B,
step 3), and its protons are released within the anammoxosome compartment. The protons then drive an ATP synthase embedded in the anammoxosome membrane. The
hydrazine oxidation enzyme obtains additional electrons
from catabolism of organic substrates. Thus, anammox
bacteria are examples of microbes whose metabolism combines lithotrophy and organotrophy.

Sulfur and Metal Oxidation

Major sources of lithotrophic electron donors are minerals
containing reduced sulfur, such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfides of iron and copper. As we saw for nitrogen compounds,
each sulfur compound that undergoes partial oxidation may
serve as an electron donor and be further oxidized.

portrayed an imaginary alien creature, the Horta, that produced corrosive acid in order to eat its way through solid
rock (Fig. 14.24A). In actuality, of course, no creatures
beyond the size of a microbe are yet known to grow in
sulfuric acid. But archaea such as Sulfolobus species oxidize
hydrogen sulfide to sulfuric acid and grow at pH 2, often in
hot springs at near-boiling temperatures (Fig. 14.24B and
C). Sulfolobus makes irregular Horta-shaped cells without
even a cell wall to maintain shape; how it protects its cytoplasm from disintegration is not yet understood.
Microbial sulfur oxidation can cause severe environmental acidification, eroding concrete structures and stone
monuments. The problem is compounded by sulfur oxidation in the presence of iron, such as in iron mine drainage.
For example, the sulfur-oxidizing archaeon Ferroplasma
acidarmanus was discovered in the abandoned mine Iron
Mountain, in northern California, by Katrina Edwards
(1968–2014; University of Southern California) and colleagues from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Ferroplasma oxidizes ferrous disulfide (pyrite) with ferric iron
(Fe3+) and water:
FeS2 + 14Fe3+ + 8H 2O → 15Fe2+ + 2SO42– + 16H+
This reaction generates large quantities of sulfuric acid.
The acidity of the mine water is near pH 0—one of the
most acidic environments found on Earth. As Ferroplasma
grows, it forms biofilms of thick streamers in the mine
drainage, which poison aquatic streams.

Anaerobic reactions between sulfur and iron cause hidden hazards for human technology, such as the corrosion
of steel in underwater bridge supports. Anaerobic corrosion
was long considered a mystery, since iron was known to
rust by means of spontaneous oxidation by O2. In anaerobic conditions, however, sulfur-reducing bacteria can corrode iron (Fig. 14.25). In one pathway, the bacteria reduce
elemental sulfur (S0) with H 2 to hydrogen sulfide (H 2S).
H 2S then combines with iron metal (Fe0), which gives
up two electrons to form Fe2+, precipitating as iron sulfide (FeS). The displaced 2H+ combine with the 2e – from
iron, regenerating H 2 —now available to reduce sulfur once
again. In an alternative mechanism, bacteria use Fe0 to
reduce sulfate directly to FeS. These damaging processes
may resemble the iron-based metabolism of Earth’s most
ancient life-forms.
Nevertheless, like the imaginary Horta that ended up
helping miners with their excavations, acid-producing
microbes are now used to supplement commercial mining,
a process called “biomining.” Lithotrophs such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans oxidize sulfides of iron and copper

Hydrogenotrophy Uses H2
as an Electron Donor

The use of molecular hydrogen (H 2) as an electron donor is
called hydrogenotrophy (Table 14.3). An example is oxidation of H 2 by sulfur to form H 2S, performed by Pyrodictium brockii, an archaeon that grows at thermal vents
above 100°C. Hydrogen gas is a stronger electron donor
than most organic foods, so it can be oxidized with the full
range of electron acceptors. It is available in anaerobic communities as a fermentation product.
Hydrogenotrophy is hard to categorize. Because H 2 is
inorganic, oxidation by O2 is considered lithotrophy; yet
many species that oxidize H 2 with molecular oxygen are

found in minerals such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), chalcocite
(Cu 2S), and covellite (CuS). The oxidation of Cu+ to Cu 2+,
as well as the acidification resulting from production of sulfate, dissolves the metal from the rock. Cu+ can be oxidized
aerobically with O2 or anaerobically with NO3 – from the
soil. Other metals oxidized by A. ferrooxidans include selenium, antimony, molybdenum, and uranium. The process
of metal dissolution from ores is called leaching. Leaching
of minerals has been a part of mining since ancient times,
long before the existence of microbes was known. Today,
over 10% of the copper supply in the United States is provided by biomining ores too low in copper to smelt directly
(Fig. 14.26). A similar process is being developed to biomine gold.

Methanogenesis

A.

Hydrogen is such a strong electron donor that it can
even reduce the highly stable carbon dioxide to methane.
Reduction of CO2 and other single-carbon compounds,
such as formate, to methane is called methanogenesis.
Methanogenesis supports a major group of archaea known
as methanogens, many of which grow solely by autotrophy,
generating methane.
The simplest form of methanogenesis involves hydrogen
reduction of CO2:

chlorobenzenes, perchloroethene, and polyvinyl chloride
(known as PVC) are highly toxic environmental pollutants. In dehalorespiration, the chlorine is removed as chloride anion and replaced by hydrogen—a reaction requiring
input of two electrons from H 2. Many soil bacteria conduct dehalorespiration; a particularly unusual cell wall–less
bacterium, Dehalococcoides (Fig. 14.27B), was discovered
that dechlorinates chlorobenzene, a highly stable aromatic
molecule.

organotrophs that also catabolize organic foods. When
hydrogen reduces an organic electron acceptor, such as
fumarate, the process may be considered either fermentation or anaerobic respiration. When hydrogen reduces a
mineral such as sulfur or sulfate, the process is anaerobic

A form of hydrogenotrophy with enormous potential for bioremediation is “dehalorespiration,” in which
halogenated organic molecules serve as electron acceptors for H 2 (Fig. 14.27A). Chlorinated molecules such as

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Because both sides of the equation contain a weak electron
acceptor (CO2, H 2O) and a strong electron donor (H 2,
CH4), it was surprising that such a reaction could yield
energy for growth. But the presence of sufficient carbon
dioxide and hydrogen supports enormous communities
of methanogens. Such conditions prevail wherever bacteria grow by fermentation and their gaseous products are
trapped, such as in landfills, where methane can be harvested as natural gas, as well as in the digestive systems of
cattle and humans. Variants of methanogenesis also include
pathways by which H 2 reduces various one-carbon and
two-carbon molecules, such as methanol, methylamine,
and acetic acid. Diverse methanogens are found in all kinds
of environments (discussed in Chapter 19).
A simplified pathway of methanogenesis from CO2
is shown in Figure 14.28. The CO2 undergoes stepwise
hydrogenation, and each oxygen is reduced to water. The
increasingly reduced carbon is transferred through a series
of unique cofactors (methanofuran, tetrahydromethanopterin, coenzyme M-SH). Three of the hydrogenation steps
involve a membrane ETS complex that includes the carrier
coenzyme F420, whose reaction generates a proton potential. Note, however, that the final step of methane production generates a transmembrane sodium potential (ΔNa+),
which drives ATP synthesis by a sodium-powered ATP synthase embedded in the cell membrane. Further details of
methanogenesis are presented in Chapter 19.

Methylotrophy

Many forms of catabolism release reduced single-carbon
molecules such as methanol (CH3OH) or methylamine
(CH3NH2). Oxidation of single-carbon molecules via an ETS
is called methylotrophy, a form of metabolism conducted
by many soil bacteria. In addition, the methane released
by methanogenesis provides a niche for methanotrophy, a
form of methylotrophy in which bacteria and archaea oxidize
methane. In deep-ocean sediment, the activity of methanogens is so high that enormous quantities of methane become
trapped on the seafloor in the form of water-based crystals
known as methane hydrates. If all the methane were to be
released at once, it would greatly accelerate global warming.
How is this methane recycled? Until recently, it was
thought that most methanotrophy required O2; indeed,
many bacteria are aerobic methanotrophs. However, the
deep-ocean sediments contain other species of bacteria and

Lithotrophy (chemolithotrophy) is the acquisition of
energy by oxidation of inorganic electron donors.
Reverse electron flow powered by Δp can generate
NADH or NADPH.
Sulfur oxidation includes oxidation of H 2S to sulfur
or to sulfuric acid by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, often
accompanied by iron oxidation. Sulfuric acid production
leads to extreme acidification.
Nitrogen oxidation includes successive oxidation of
ammonia to hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, and nitric
acid. Anammox, the oxidation of ammonium ion by
nitrite, returns half the ocean’s N2 to the atmosphere.
Hydrogenotrophy uses hydrogen gas as an electron
donor. Hydrogen (H 2) has sufficient reducing potential to donate electrons to nearly all biological electron
acceptors, including chlorinated organic molecules
(through dehalorespiration).
Methanogenesis is the oxidation of H 2 by CO2, releasing methane. Methanogenesis is performed only by the
methanogen group of archaea.
Methylotrophs use O2, nitrite, or sulfate to oxidize
single-carbon compounds such as methane, methanol, or
methylamine. A class of methylotrophs called methanotrophs specifically oxidize methane.

Retinal-Based Proton Pumps

In most ecosystems, the dominant source of carbon and
energy is photosynthesis based on chlorophyll. At the same
time, many halophilic archaea and marine bacteria supplement their metabolism with a simpler, more ancient form of
phototrophy based on a single-protein light-driven proton
pump containing the pigment retinal. Many varieties of the
retinal-based proton pump have evolved, known as bacteriorhodopsin in haloarchaea and as proteorhodopsin in
bacteria. We present bacteriorhodopsin as a relatively simple
form of phototrophy, followed by the more complex ETSbased photolysis in bacteria and chloroplasts.

Phototrophy

On Earth today, the ultimate source of electrons driving
metabolism is phototrophy, the use of photoexcited electrons to power cell growth. Every year, photosynthesis
converts more than 10% of atmospheric carbon dioxide to
biomass, most of which then feeds microbial and animal
heterotrophs. Most of Earth’s photosynthetic production,
especially in the oceans, comes from microbes (discussed in
Chapter 21). Even the frigid seas of Antarctica support vast
communities of phototrophic algae and bacteria, at –2°C
beneath pack ice (Fig. 14.29).
In phototrophy, the energy of a photoexcited electron
is transferred through an ETS to pump protons. Different
kinds of phototrophy include the bacteriorhodopsin proton
pump; the single-cycle chlorophyll-based photosystems I

dopsin is a small membrane protein commonly found in
halophilic archaea (or haloarchaea) such as Halobacterium
salinarum, a single-celled archaeon that grows in evaporating salt flats containing concentrated NaCl (discussed in
Chapter 19). For many years, bacteriorhodopsin-like proton
pumps were thought to be limited to extreme halophilic
archaea. As bacterial genomes were sequenced, however,
homologs of the protein appeared in several species of proteobacteria; the homologs were termed proteorhodopsin.
The proteorhodopsin genes appear to have entered bacteria by horizontal transfer from halophilic archaea. In 2005,
Oded Béjà and colleagues from Israel, Austria, Korea, and
the United States surveyed the genomes of unculturable
bacteria from the upper waters of the Mediterranean and
Red seas. They found that 13% of the marine bacteria contain proteorhodopsins, accounting for a substantial—and
previously unrecognized—fraction of marine phototrophy.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Bacteriorhodopsin absorbs light with a broad peak in the
green range; thus, the organisms containing large amounts
of bacteriorhodopsin reflect blue and red, appearing purple.
The protein consists of seven hydrophobic alpha helices surrounding a molecule of retinal, the same cofactor bound to
light-absorbing opsins in the vertebrate retina (Fig. 14.30A).
In bacteriorhodopsin, the retinal is attached to the nitrogen
end of a lysine residue (Fig. 14.30B).
Retinal has a series of conjugated double bonds that
absorb visible light. Upon absorbing a photon, an electron

in one of the double bonds is excited to a higher energy level.
This process is called photoexcitation. As the electron falls
back to the ground state, the double bond shifts position
from trans (substituents pointing opposite) to cis (substituents pointing in the same direction). This change in shape
of the retinal alters the conformation of the entire protein,
causing it to pick up a proton from the cytoplasm. Eventually, the retinal switches back to its original trans configuration. The reversion to trans is coupled to the release of
a proton from the opposite end of the protein facing outside of the cell. Thus, photoexcitation of bacteriorhodopsin
is coupled to the pumping of one H+ across the membrane.
The proton gradient generated by bacteriorhodopsin drives
ATP synthesis by a typical F1Fo ATP synthase. Light capture
by bacteriorhodopsin supplements catabolism for energy and
heterotrophy for carbon source. This combination of light
absorption and heterotrophy is a form of photoheterotrophy.

phototroph needs to solve is how to “capture” light rays. For
chemotrophy, food molecules diffuse in solution and can be
picked up by receptors for transport into a cell. Phototrophy,
however, requires a photon to impinge on one point of the
cell, where the photon either is absorbed or passes through.
Thus, the only way to absorb a high percentage of photons is
to spread light-absorbing pigments over a wide surface area.
To maximize light absorption, Halobacterium salinarum
archaea pack their entire cell membranes with bacteriorhodopsin. The protein assembles in trimers that pack in hexagonal arrays, forming the “purple membrane” (Fig. 14.31).

A. Bacteriorhodopsin contains seven alpha helices that span the
membrane in alternating directions and surround a molecule of retinal, which is linked to a lysine residue. (PDB code: 1FBB) B. A photon
(hν) is absorbed by retinal, which shifts the configuration from trans
to cis. The relaxation back to the trans form is coupled to pumping
1H+ across the membrane. (PDB code: 1M0L) Source: Purple Membrane:

nevertheless illustrates several principles that apply to more
complex forms of phototrophy:
A photoreceptor absorbs light, causing excitation of an
electron to a higher energy level, followed by return to
the ground state.

To maximize light collection, large numbers of photoreceptors are packed throughout a membrane.

The photocycle (absorption and relaxation of the lightabsorbing molecule) is coupled to energy storage in the

Chlorophyll Photoexcitation
and Photolysis

Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts, as well as other kinds of
bacteria, obtain energy by photoexcitation of chlorophylls.
Figuring out their “light reactions”—the fundamental
source of energy for Earth’s biosphere—was one of the most
exciting projects of the twentieth century. Among hundreds
of important contributors, we note two major figures: the
married couple Roger Stanier (1916–1982) and Germaine
Cohen-Bazire (1920–2001) (Fig. 14.32A and B). Stanier,
a Canadian microbial physiologist at UC Berkeley, clarified
the nature of cyanobacteria as phototrophic prokaryotes
distinct from eukaryotic algae, and he helped distinguish
the water-based photosynthesis of cyanobacteria from the
sulfide metabolism of purple bacteria. Cohen-Bazire was a
French bacterial geneticist who had studied lac operon regulation with Nobel laureate Jacques Monod at the Pasteur
Institute in Paris. Cohen-Bazire applied her genetics skills
to phototrophs, and she conducted the first genetic analysis
of photosynthesis in purple bacteria and cyanobacteria.
Cyanobacteria, the only oxygen-producing bacteria, appear
green, like algae or plants (Fig. 14.32C). Their green color
arises from their chlorophyll, which absorbs blue and red but
reflects green. Cyanobacteria include a wide range of species,
such as the ocean’s major producers, the submicroscopic Prochlorococcus marinus, barely visible under a light microscope.
Other cyanobacteria have cells as large as eukaryotic algae and
form complex developmental structures with important symbiotic associations (see Chapters 18 and 21). Cyanobacteria
are among the most successful and diverse groups of life on

Earth. Along with the chloroplasts of algae and plants, cyanobacteria produce all the oxygen available for aerobic life.
Overview of photolysis. The energy for photosynthesis

derives from the photoexcitation of a light-absorbing pigment. Photoexcitation leads to photolysis, the light-driven
separation of an electron from a molecule coupled to an
ETS. The components of the ETS are often homologous
to those of respiratory electron transport, and they share
common electron carriers such as iron-sulfur clusters.
In plant chloroplasts and in cyanobacteria, photolysis
is known as the “light reactions,” coupled to the “lightindependent reactions” of carbon dioxide fixation. Note,
however, that many of the sulfur- or organic-based bacterial phototrophs, such as Rhodospirillum rubrum, combine
photolysis with heterotrophy instead of with CO2 fixation.
At the same time, lithotrophic bacteria such as Nitrospira
and Acidithiobacillus fix CO2 using energy from mineral
oxidation instead of photolysis. In this chapter we focus on
photolysis in cyanobacteria. We discuss CO2 fixation along
with other biosynthetic pathways later, in Chapter 15.

Chlorophyll structure.

Chlorophyll has a heterocyclic chromophore
with a magnesium ion coordinated to four
nitrogens. Different chlorophyll types differ
mainly in small substituents of the chromophore; for example, an aldehyde replaces the
ring II methyl group of chlorophyll a to make
chlorophyll b.

In ETS-based photosynthesis, photoexcitation leads to
separation of an electron from a donor molecule such as
H 2O or H 2S. Each electron is then transferred to an ETS,
whose components show common ancestry with respiratory ETS proteins. The ETS generates a proton potential
and the reduced cofactor NADPH. The proton potential drives ATP synthesis through an F1Fo ATP synthase,
similar to the one for respiration.
Chlorophylls absorb light. The main light-absorbing pig-

ments are chlorophylls. Each type of chlorophyll contains
a characteristic chromophore, a light-absorbing electron
carrier. The chlorophyll chromophore consists of a heteroaromatic ring complexed to a magnesium ion (Mg2+)
(Fig. 14.33). As we saw for ETS electron carriers, metal
ions and aromatic molecules offer electrons with relatively
narrow energy transitions. The chromophore absorbs a photon through a reversible energy transition, such that the
chlorophyll can alternate between excited and ground states.
Chlorophyll molecules differ slightly in their substituent
groups around the ring; for example, chlorophyll a of chloroplasts has a methyl group in ring II, whereas chlorophyll b
has an aldehyde. Both chlorophylls a and b are made by chloroplasts and by cyanobacteria, their nearest bacterial relatives.
Because they absorb red and blue, they reflect the middle
range of the spectrum and so appear green (Fig. 14.34A).

By contrast, the chlorophylls of anaerobic phototrophs, or
“purple bacteria,” such as Rhodobacter and Rhodospirillum,
absorb most strongly in the far-red (infrared) and, in some
cases, ultraviolet ranges (Fig. 14.34B). Their chlorophylls
are specifically named bacteriochlorophylls. The purple
bacteria grow in pond water or sediment. Bacteriochlorophyll absorption over an extended range of wavelengths
helps capture light missed by the cyanobacteria and algae at
the water’s surface. In purple bacteria, bacteriochlorophylls
are supplemented by accessory pigments called carotenoids,
which absorb light of green wavelengths and transfer the

energy to bacteriochlorophyll. The combination of greenabsorbing carotenoids and infrared-absorbing bacteriochlorophylls makes cultures appear deep purple or brown.
The infrared radiation absorbed by bacteriochlorophylls
is too weak to permit splitting H 2O to produce oxygen.
Thus, purple bacteria are limited to photolysis of H 2S and
small organic molecules; many are photoheterotrophs. On
the other hand, infrared rays are available in water below
the oxygenic phototrophs absorbing red and blue. Thus,
anaerobic phototrophs grow at depths where their more
high-powered oxygenic relatives do not.

Note:

Distinguish among these classes of photopigments:

■ Bacteriorhodopsin is a retinal-containing proton pump.
■ Chlorophyll is a charge-separating photopigment (usually refer-

ring to chloroplasts and cyanobacteria).

■ Bacteriochlorophyll is a charge-separating chlorophyll of

anaerobic purple and green bacteria (also known generically as
chlorophyll).

■ Carotenoid is an accessory pigment that absorbs the midrange

of light wavelengths but does not directly conduct photolysis.

Instead, they must be captured by absorption. The larger

To maximize light collection, many molecules of chlorophyll are grouped in an antenna complex. These antenna
complexes are arranged like a satellite dish within the plane
of the membrane in an elaborate cluster around accessory
proteins (Fig. 14.35A and B). The clusters then associate

in a ring around the reaction center (RC), the protein
complex in which chlorophyll photoexcitation connects to
the ETS (Fig. 14.35C). Throughout the complex of bacteeriochlorophylls and accessory pigments, whichever pigment
nt
molecule happens to be in the right place at the right time
me
captures the photon. The energy from the photon then
en
transfers at random from one chromophore to the next,
xt,
until it arrives at the reaction center for electron transfer
fer
to the ETS. Other kinds of bacteria have other forms of
antenna complexes, such as the “phycobilisome” of cyanoobacteria (discussed shortly).
Purple bacteria and cyanobacteria increase their effifihe
ciency of photon uptake by extensive backfolding of the
photosynthetic membranes in oval pockets stacked like pita
ta
breads (Fig. 14.36). These oval pockets are called thylakoids. The extensive packing of thylakoids gives an incident photon hundreds of chances to meet a chlorophyll at
just the right angle for absorption.
The thylakoids are connected by tubular extensions, so
that there exists one interior space, the lumen, separated
topologically from the regular cytoplasm, or stroma. Protons are pumped from the stroma across the thylakoid
membrane into the lumen. The F1Fo complex is embedded
in the thylakoid, where it makes ATP using the proton current running through it into the cytoplasm. The F1 knob of
ATP synthase appears to face “outward” in photosynthetic
organelles (as opposed to “inward” in respiratory chains).
In each case, however, the proton current and ATP motor
face in the same direction with respect to the cytoplasm
(stroma). The proton potential is more negative in the cytoplasm (stroma), thus drawing protons through the ATP
synthase to generate ATP.

the absorption of light by chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophyll drives the separation of an electron. The chlorophyll
may then gain an electron from the ETS, as in Rhodospirillum or Rhodobacter, or it may remove an electron from
H 2 S or H 2O, depending on the photosystem of a given
bacterial species. In either case, the excited electron carries energy gained from the light absorbed. The excited
electron enters a membrane-embedded ETS of oxidoreductases and quinones/quinols, as we saw for the ETS of
respiration and lithotrophy.
Diverse kinds of photosynthesis in different environmental niches include oxygenic, sulfur-based, iron-dependent, and even heterotrophic photolysis. Nevertheless, all
forms of photolysis share a common design:
1. Antenna system. The antenna system (Fig. 14.35)
maximizes photon capture. A phototrophic antenna
system is a large complex of chlorophylls that captures photons and transfers their energy among the

photopigments until it reaches
a reaction center. A complex of
chlorophylls and accessory pigments in the photosynthetic membrane collects photons. Energy
from each photoexcited electron
is transferred among antenna pigments and eventually to the reaction center.
2. Reaction center complex. In the
reaction center, the photon energy
is used to separate an electron
from chlorophyll. The electron
is replaced by one from a small
molecule such as H2S (photosystem I, or PS I) or from the ETS
(photosystem II, or PS II).
3. Electron transport system. Each
photoexcited electron enters an
ETS. In PS I, electrons separated
from H2O or H2S are transferred
to NADP+ to form NADPH. In
PS II, the electron separated from
bacteriochlorophyll is replaced
by an electron returned from the
ETS. In the oxygenic Z pathway
(H2O photolysis), electrons flow
from PS II into PS I, ultimately
releasing O2 from H2O.
4. Energy carriers. In PS I, electrons are used to make NADPH.
In PS II, electron transfer provides energy to pump protons and
drive the synthesis of ATP. The Z
pathway makes both NADPH and
ATP, which are used to fix CO2.

found in cyanobacteria and in the chloroplasts of green
plants.
The components of photosystems I and II (PS I and
PS II) share common ancestry. Each system runs anaerobically, producing sulfur or oxidized organic by-products,
but not O2. Each photosystem shows more recent homology with the respective PS I and PS II components of the
oxygenic Z pathway (so called because the electron path
through a diagram of the two photosystems traces a Z).
The Z pathway ultimately generates O2 —the source of
nearly all the oxygen we breathe.

Note:

In photolysis, each quantum of light excites a single electron. Some ETS components, such as the quinones/quinols (Q →
QH2) actually process two of these electrons in completing their
redox cycle. The single-electron intermediate states of quinones
are not shown in Figures 14.37, 14.38, and 14.40.

species use PSI (Fig. 14.37). The reaction center (RC) contains bacteriochlorophyll P840, named for its peak absorption at 840 nm—that is, the near-infrared, actually beyond
the range humans can see. But P840 and the chlorophylls

■

of the antenna complex also absorb light over shorter wavelengths, in the range of 400–550 nm.
The Chlorobium antenna complex consists of a membrane
compartment called a chlorosome (Fig. 14.37B). A single
chlorosome may contain 200,000 molecules of bacteriochlorophyll, harvesting photons with nearly 100% efficiency.
The chlorosome is so sensitive that some chlorobia actually
harvest thermal radiation from deep-sea thermal vents.
When any one bacteriochlorophyll absorbs a photon, the
energy transfers among the photopigments until it reaches
the PS I reaction center (Fig. 14.37). The photon yields
sufficient energy to donate the high-potential electron to
a high-potential quinone: phylloquinone/phylloquinol
(PQ). Phylloquinol donates the electron to ferredoxin,
an FeS protein. Ferredoxin transfers the electron to the
enzyme ferredoxin-NAD+ reductase; two of these electrons
then reduce NAD+ or the energetically equivalent NADP+.
The reduced carrier (NADH or NADPH) provides reductive energy for CO2 fixation and biosynthesis (discussed in
Chapter 15).
Chlorobium is a true autotroph, fixing CO2 for biosynthesis (see Chapter 15). However, the phototrophic ETS
is supplemented by lithotrophy, the donation of electrons
from sulfur or H 2. The PS I electron flow generates a net
proton gradient by consuming H+ inside and generating
H+ outside the cell, thus providing proton motive force to
drive ATP synthesis.

alphaproteobacteria such as Rhodospirillum rubrum and
Rhodopseudomonas palustris are typically found in wetlands and streams, where they capture light not used by
other phototrophs. Their antenna complex was shown
earlier, in Figure 14.35. The peak wavelength absorbed
by bacteriochlorophyll P870 lies so far into the infrared

(800–1,100 nm) that the photon energy is insufficient to
reduce NAD(P) to NAD(P)H. The electrons from P870
are transferred by low-potential quinols to a terminal cytochrome oxidoreductase (Fig. 14.38). The quinols pass
their electrons to cytochromes, while moving 2H+ across
the membrane. When the electrons reach cytochrome c,
they flow back to bacteriochlorophyll, where they can be
reexcited by photon energy from the antenna complex.
Because the electron path traces back to its source, the ETS
of photosystem II leading to ATP synthesis is called cyclic
photophosphorylation.
Since the reduction potential is too small to reduce
NADP+ to NADPH, photosystem II requires reverse electron flow. As we saw for iron oxidation (see Section 14.5), in
reverse electron flow a low-potential electron donor reduces
an ETS, requiring input of energy. Purple bacteria obtain
this energy by spending ATP to increase the proton potential, or from a pathway outside photolysis, such as catabolism of organic compounds. The organic compounds also
provide substrates for biosynthesis. Thus, most purple bacteria are photoheterotrophs.
Purple bacteria such as Rhodopseudomonas palustris are
the ultimate generalists, often combining several major
classes of metabolism (Fig. 14.39). Caroline Harwood
and colleagues at the University of Washington showed
that R. palustris is a “photolithoheterotroph,” capable
of photosynthesis, catabolism on many substrates, and
lithotrophy (eTopic 14.2). Anaerobically, R. palustris is
“the bacterium that eats everything,” catabolizing sugars,
fatty acids, and lignin to obtain reduced electron carriers.
Meanwhile, the bacteria make ATP through anoxygenic
photosynthesis (cyclic photophosphorylation). In the presence of oxygen, R. palustris can fix CO2 by lithotrophy.
These bacteria also fix atmospheric nitrogen (discussed
in Chapter 15). During nitrogen fixation (powered by

photosystem II) the nitrogenase enzyme transfers electrons onto hydrogen ions, forming hydrogen gas. Harwood’s laboratory is engineering strains of R. palustris to
increase the light-driven hydrogen output. Hydrogen production offers an exciting potential source of “clean” biofuel, using photosynthesis and catabolism of sewage waste.
Thought Question

14.12 Suppose you discover bacteria that require a high concentration of Fe2+ for photosynthesis. Can you hypothesize what
the role of Fe2+ may be? How would you test your hypothesis?

Oxygenic photolysis. The “Z” pathway of photolysis found

in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts combines key features of
both PS II and PS I (Fig. 14.40 ). Both reaction centers,
however, contain chlorophylls that absorb at shorter wavelengths (higher energy) than those of the respective purple or green homologs: P680 instead of P870 (PS II), and
P700 instead of P840 (PS I). Thus, the cyanobacterial reaction centers can split water—a highly stable molecule that
cannot be photolyzed by anaerobic phototrophs. Photolysis
of water requires greater energy input, but ultimately yields
greater energy overall, and produces molecular oxygen. The
energy potentials are high enough to generate NADPH and
fi x CO2 into biomass (presented in Chapter 15). Oxygenic
phototrophs dominate the shallow water depths, whereas
anaerobes grow at lower depths, using light at wavelengths
unused by cyanobacteria and algae near the surface.
Cyanobacteria harvest light via an exceptionally efficient
antenna complex called the phycobilisome (Fig. 14.40B).
In the PS II reaction center, the photoexcitation of chlorophyll P680 yields enough energy to split H 2O. The entire
cycle of water splitting involves 4H+ removed from 2H 2O,
4e – transferred to carriers, and the formation of O2. The
net reaction forming oxygen is:
2H 2O → 4H+ + 4e – + O2
Through the ETS, the electrons are transferred to quinones. As in respiration, each 2e – reduction of quinone to
quinol requires pickup of 2H+ from the stroma (equivalent to cytoplasm). Thus, the four electrons transferred
generate a net change in the proton gradient of 4H+. Furthermore, the energy of electron transfer to cytochrome
bf enables pumping of an additional 2H+ across the membrane. Thus, in all, for each conversion of 2H 2O to O2
the net protons transferred across the thylakoid membrane include 4H+ (water photolysis) plus 4 × 2H+ (quinones to quinols) through cytochrome bf, to yield a total
of 12H+ for the proton gradient. The proton gradient
drives the ATP synthase to make approximately 3 ATP
per O2 formed.

The electrons from PS II do not cycle back to the PS II
reaction center, as they do in purple bacteria. Instead they
are transferred to PS I by a protein called plastocyanin.
The energy of the electron transferred by plastocyanin is
augmented through absorption of a second photon by the
chlorophyll of PS I. Subsequent electron flow through ferredoxin can now generate NADH or NADPH. Some of the
electron flow instead cycles back to cytochrome bf, where it
contributes to pumping protons.
The overall equation for energy yield of oxygenic photolysis can be represented as:
2H 2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 [ADP + Pi] →
O2 + 2 [NADPH + H+] + 3 ATP + 3H 2O
To release one O2 and fix one CO2 requires absorption
of between 8 and 12 photons. The efficiency—that is, the
proportion of photon energy converted to CO2 fixation—
is estimated to be 20%–30%. To generate one molecule of
glucose by CO2 fixation, we need six rounds of the photolysis equation—one per CO2 molecule “fixed” into sugar
(C6H12O6) (discussed in Chapter 15). The CO2 fixation
equation works out to:
12H 2O + 12 NADP+ + 18 [ADP + Pi] →
6O2 + 12 [NADPH + H+] + 18 ATP + 18H 2O
6CO2 + 12 [NADPH + H+] + 18 ATP + 18H 2O →
C6H12O6 + 6H 2O + 12 NADP+ + 18 [ADP + Pi]
12H 2O + 6CO2 → C6H12O6 + 6H 2O + 6O2

Bacteriorhodopsin and proteorhodopsin are forms of
a light-driven proton pump that contains retinal, found
in haloarchaea and in bacteria, respectively. The energy
gained from light absorption supplements heterotrophy.
The antenna complex of chlorophylls and other photopigments captures light for transfer to the reaction
center in chlorophyll-based photosynthesis.
Thylakoids are folded membranes within phototrophic
bacteria or chloroplasts. The membranes extend the area
for chlorophyll light absorption, and they separate two
compartments to form a proton gradient.
Photosystem I obtains electrons from H 2S or HS –.
The electrons are transferred through an ETS to form
NADH or NADPH.
Photosystem II transfers an electron through an ETS
and pumps H+ to generate ATP. An electron ultimately returns to bacteriochlorophyll through cyclic
photophosphorylation. Reverse electron flow generates
NADPH or NADH.

ow do microbes build their cells? Some bacteria and archaea build themselves entirely from
carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas, plus a few
salts. The cell assimilates carbon and nitrogen into
small molecules and then assembles more complex
structures using many enzymes. How do cells organize their biosynthesis to build precisely the forms
they need? How do bacteria avoid wasting energy on
excess production? New genomes reveal new microbial capacities for biosynthesis, ranging from antibiotics and pesticides to surgical materials.

15.1 Overview of Biosynthesis

What is the most interesting thing
about a new actinomycete producing
the antibiotic ristocetin?

The new actinomycete we discovered provides the first known gene
sequences for enzymes responsible
for ristocetin production. Discovery of
the cluster is a proof of principle for
our two-step bioassay system, verifying that it is actually working in a real-world screening for
glycopeptide natural products.
What new discoveries about antibiotics do you expect
to see?

Teicoplanin
(control antibiotic)

We would expect that if we extend the screening to cover
many more strains from different collections, we would
be able to discover entirely new glycopeptide antibiotics
and the genes that encode their synthesis. We also anticipate that some of the enzymes in the ristocetin cluster
will find use in helping to make novel combinatorial glycopeptide structures, which may have novel activity against
pathogens.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

In Chapters 13 and 14 we learned how microbes use chemical reactions to gain energy, storing it in ion gradients and
in small molecules such as ATP and NADPH. Chapter 15
shows how the microbes spend this energy for biosynthesis. An example is Amycolatopsis MJM2582, the actinomycete bacterium isolated by South Korean biochemist
Hee-Jeon Hong and colleagues at the University of Cambridge, including her student Min Jun Kwun (Fig. 15.1).
The white fuzz on the actinomycete colonies is full of
arthrospores (see Chapters 5 and 18), which can blow off to
another location. When the cell filaments enter stationary
phase (discussed in Chapter 4), they begin to produce dozens of different secondary products, such as the antibiotic
ristocetin (Fig. 15.1, inset). Such antibiotics show extraordinary diversity and complexity, often including multiple
aromatic rings—a surprising biosynthetic feat for an organism that’s running out of resources. But the antibiotics
enable the producer to outcompete other bacteria, killing
them to scavenge their substrates for biosynthesis. Antibiotic synthesis requires elaborate enzyme complexes and
multistep reaction pathways. Hong’s lab identified such a
pathway in the Amycolatopsis genome. The genome reveals
a span of 79,000 base pairs comprising thirty-nine genes
for enzymes, regulators, and transporters—all to produce
and export the antibiotic ristocetin.
Chapter 15 presents the fundamental ways that microbes
perform biosynthesis. Autotrophs assimilate elements such
as carbon and nitrogen to build useful carbon skeletons, key

HO

functions in the food web. Microbial enzyme factories build
remarkably complex biomolecules, including vitamins and
antibiotics important for human health. Industrial applications of microbial biosynthesis are described in Chapter 16.

15.1

Biosynthesis is the building of complex biomolecules,
also known as anabolism, the reverse of catabolism. Figure 15.2 presents an overview of anabolism, or biosynthesis,
and how it relates to catabolic pathways we saw in Chapter
13. Enzyme pathways such as the TCA cycle are reversed to
build up carbon skeletons, incorporating nitrogen to form
amino acids. Ultimately, sugar monomers and amino acids
are assembled to form polysaccharides, polypeptides, and
the cell wall material, peptidoglycan. Besides the biomass
of the cell proper, cells synthesize and secrete products such
as antibiotics, toxins for pathogenesis, quorum signals for
cooperation, and matrix for biofilm (eTopic 15.1). All this
biosynthesis requires substrates and energy.

Biosynthesis Requires Substrates

For their biosynthesis, where do microbes obtain their
organic substrates, such as acetyl-CoA? Some microbes
synthesize all their organic parts from minerals such as

carbonate and nitrate (autotrophy). Two fundamental
classes of autotrophy are photosynthesis and chemosynthesis. In photosynthesis, or photoautotrophy, single carbon
molecules (usually CO2) are fixed into organic biomass,
using energy from light absorption (discussed in Chapter 14). Chemosynthesis fixes carbon dioxide via similar
pathways, but without light. The energy for chemosynthesis usually comes from oxidation of minerals (lithotrophy; see Chapter 14). Other microorganisms must obtain
organic substrates from their environment (heterotrophy).
Many soil microbes are capable of both autotrophy and heterotrophy, depending on what their environment provides.
For all organisms, biosynthesis requires:
■

Essential elements. Biosynthesis requires carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and other essential elements.
Carbon is obtained either through CO2 fi xation (autotrophy) or through acquisition of organic molecules
made by other organisms (heterotrophy). Autotrophy

assembles carbon and water into small molecules such
as acetyl-CoA, which then serve as substrates or building blocks for the cell. By contrast, heterotrophy breaks
down larger molecules such as carbohydrates and peptides to release acetyl-CoA and other small substrates. In
addition to carbon, biosynthesis must assimilate nitrogen and sulfur for proteins, phosphorus for DNA, and
metals for metal-containing enzymes.
■

Reduction. Biosynthesis usually reduces the substrate,
by hydrogenation and by removing oxygen. Cell components such as lipids and amino acids are more reduced
than substrates such as CO2 and acetate, so their biosynthesis requires a reducing agent such as NADPH.

■

Energy. Building complex structures, with or without
reduction, requires energy. Biosynthetic enzymes spend
energy by coupling their reactions to the hydrolysis of
ATP, the oxidation of NADPH, or the flux of ions down
a transmembrane ion gradient.

Heterotrophs such as E. coli and actinomycetes obtain
many substrates from glucose catabolism and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, central catabolic pathways discussed
in Chapter 13 (Fig. 15.3). For example, the succinyl-CoA
molecules from the TCA cycle serve as the foundation of
several kinds of amino acids, as well as vitamin B12. Glycerol 3-phosphate provides the glyceride backbone of lipids.
Pyruvate provides the backbone of several amino acids with

aliphatic side chains. From the pentose phosphate pathway erythrose 4-phosphate contributes to the ring structures of aromatic amino acids. Other amino acids derive
their carbon skeleton from TCA cycle intermediates oxaloacetate and 2-oxoglutarate, which incorporate nitrogen in
the form of ammonium ions (NH4+).
Note that glucose catabolism and the TCA cycle are
both reversible. Some autotrophs can synthesize entire

CHAPTER 15

sugar molecules, starting with CO2 and working up
through the reverse TCA cycle and reverse glycolysis.
(The reversal of glycolysis is called gluconeogenesis).
Thus, many common metabolites are available both to
autotrophs and to heterotrophs, as well as to microbes
capable of mixed metabolism.

■

Thought Question

15.1 To run the TCA cycle and glycolysis in reverse, does a cell
use the same enzymes or different ones? Explain why some
enzymes might be used in both directions, whereas other steps
require different enzymes for catabolic and anabolic directions.

Competition and predation. Free-living bacteria
secrete antimicrobial agents that inhibit or kill competitors. The victors scavenge the spoils for raw materials. Actinomycetes, such as those discussed at the start
of the chapter, possess large genomes that commonly
encode enzymes for multiple antibiotics. High nutrient
levels inhibit antibiotic production, but as the bacterial
filaments grow more slowly in stationary phase, they
start producing antibiotics.

571

Genome loss and cooperation. A drastic way to avoid
the expense of biosynthesis is to lose the enzymes
through reductive evolution (discussed in Chapter 17).
But the species then depends on intricate relations with
other community members. Parasites and mutualists that
grow only within a host cell show the most extensive loss
of biosynthetic genes. Each species takes an evolutionary
path of maintaining the expense of a particular biosynthetic pathway, such as N2 fi xation, or of losing the pathway and becoming dependent on partner organisms.

Regulation. Biosynthesis is regulated at multiple levels, such as gene transcription, protein synthesis, and
allosteric enzyme control. In general, energy-expensive
products block the expression or function of their biosynthetic enzymes. For example, as we saw in Chapter 10, if the cell’s tryptophan concentration increases,
the molecule binds a corepressor to block transcription
of the genes for tryptophan biosynthesis; and the aminoacyl-tRNA stalls the ribosome midtranslation. In this
way, microbes avoid making more than they need under
given conditions. Microbes regulate their biosynthesis at
the levels of transcription and translation of enzymes, as
well as through feedback inhibition of enzyme activity.
An important example of molecular regulation is nitrogen fi xation, discussed in Section 15.5.

BIOSYNTHESIS

Surprisingly, many marine phototrophs no longer encode
certain biosynthetic pathways and depend on synthesis by
partner heterotrophs. For example, on the sea ice of the
Southern Ocean (temperatures around 0°C), Andrew Allen
at the J. Craig Venter Institute discovered a fundamental
mutualism of Antarctic diatoms and bacteria (Fig. 15.4).
The Southern Ocean is highly productive for biomass
and oxygen, because of the high solar irradiance and iron

Biosynthesis Spends Energy

Biosynthesis costs energy in several ways. The organism’s genome must maintain the DNA that encodes all
the enzymes that catalyze all the steps of the pathway.
The ribosomes spend energy to make enzymes. And the
enzymes couple synthetic reactions to energy-releasing
reactions. Collectively, these genomic and energetic costs
generate enormous selective pressure for microbes to evolve
mechanisms that control these costs. The diversity of these
cost-cutting mechanisms generates surprising ecological
relationships.

availability. Many of the sea ice phytoplankton (phototrophic algae) fail to synthesize vitamin B12, a fundamental
cofactor for enzymes but one of the most complicated biomolecules to synthesize. Allen’s group found that the Antarctic diatoms obtain vitamin B12 from adherent bacteria.
The major bacteria providing the vitamin are Oceanospirillales, a family of proteobacteria known for cleaning up oil
spills (see Chapter 21).
Closer to home, our gut bacteria also evolve ingenious
ways to share substrates and minimize biosynthesis. Samay
Pande and coworkers at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Biology, Jena, Germany, investigated resource sharing
in E. coli by constructing a complementary pair of mutants

A.

in which each overproduced an amino acid (histidine or
tryptophan). Pande found that when the growth medium
lacked the two complementary biosynthesis pathways (for
His or Trp), the two bacterial strains formed nanotubes of
phospholipids derived from the cell envelope (Fig. 15.5).
But when the medium provided the amino acids needed,
the nanotubes failed to form. Thus, even within the competitive gut microbial community, bacteria find ways to
share excess carbon substrates for biosynthesis—and regulate their sharing to avoid helping a competitor when a
ready source is available.
In this chapter we present the pathways by which autotrophs assimilate carbon and nitrogen into simple building
blocks, such as acetyl-CoA. Then we present pathways of
construction of the key parts of the cell, such as fatty acids
and amino acids. Finally, we consider exciting recent discoveries in the biosynthesis of secondary products such as
antibiotics.

15.2

The fundamental significance of carbon dioxide fixation by green plants and algae was recognized in the
early twentieth century. “Fixation” refers to the covalent
incorporation of a small molecule into larger biochemical material. Fixing carbon requires tremendous energy
input, as well as a large degree of reduction to incorporate hydrogen atoms.
The majority of the biomass on Earth consists of carbon fixed by chloroplasts and bacteria through the

reductive pentose phosphate cycle, which recycles a pentose phosphate intermediate. This cycle is also known as
the Calvin cycle, for which Melvin Calvin (1911–1997)
was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The full
Calvin cycle is found only in bacteria and in chloroplasts,
which evolved from bacteria. It has not been found in
archaea or in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes. (Archaea and
some lithoautotrophic bacteria fix carbon by other pathways, as described in Section 15.3.) Thus, the Calvin cycle
appears to have evolved after the divergence of the three
domains of life.
The mechanism of the pentose phosphate cycle was
solved by Calvin with colleagues Andrew Benson and
James Bassham, at UC Berkeley. The importance of the
Calvin cycle to the global ecosystem can scarcely be overestimated; it plays a major role in removing atmospheric CO2.
The Calvin cycle’s responsiveness to CO2, temperature, and
other factors must be considered in all models of global
warming.

Note:

The Calvin cycle is also known as the Calvin-Benson
cycle, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, or the CBB cycle. This
book uses the terms “Calvin cycle” and “CBB cycle.”

Several categories of bacteria conduct the Calvin cycle
(Fig. 15.6 and Table 15.1). Photoautotrophs such as cyanobacteria—and all plant chloroplasts—use the Calvin cycle
to fix CO2. Some photoheterotrophs, such as Rhodobacter
sphaeroides, use the Calvin cycle only when light is available; in the dark, they use preformed substrates (heterotrophy). Still other bacteria fix CO2 using energy from metal
oxidation (lithoautotrophy) (see Chapter 14). For example,

Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Fig. 15.6C) oxidizes sulfur
and iron, generating acid that corrodes concrete.
■

Oxygenic phototrophic bacteria (cyanobacteria) and
the chloroplasts of algae and multicellular plants fi x
CO2 by the Calvin cycle coupled to oxygenic photosynthesis. The Calvin cycle is also called the “dark reactions,” or “light-independent reactions,” of oxygenic
photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria are believed to generate
the majority of the oxygen gas in Earth’s atmosphere.

■

Facultatively anaerobic purple bacteria, including
sulfur oxidizers and photoheterotrophs such as Rhodospirillum and Rhodobacter, use the Calvin cycle to
fix CO2. These bacteria also obtain carbon through
catabolism.

■

Lithoautotrophic bacteria fix CO2 through the Calvin
cycle, using NADPH and ATP provided by the oxidation
of minerals. Mineral oxidation actually consumes oxygen.

Overview of the Calvin Cycle

Decades of biochemical and genetic experiments established
the details of CO2 fixation in the Calvin cycle. Early in the
twentieth century, biochemists tried to figure out the mechanism of CO2 fixation, believing that agricultural photosynthesis could be made more efficient. With the tools then
available, however, researchers had no hope of sorting out
the intermediate products through which CO2 was fixed.
A fundamental breakthrough was the use of tracer radioisotopes, which are specific compounds labeled with radioactivity. The discovery of the carbon isotope 14C by Martin

Kamen (1913–2002) in 1940 revolutionized biochemistry,
enabling the discovery of all kinds of cellular metabolism
(eTopic 15.2). Another key technique was paper chromatography, a means of separating labeled compounds based on
differential migration in a solvent. This technique reveals
short-lived intermediate compounds of a cycle. Calvin used
paper chromatography for his Nobel-winning experiments
to figure out the cycle that bears his name (eTopic 15.3).
Figure 15.7 shows an overview of the key steps of the
Calvin cycle. The cycle begins with CO2 fixation by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, a key intermediate that can derive
from the pentose phosphate cycle. This reaction is catalyzed
by the enzyme Rubisco (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), believed to be the most abundant protein
on Earth. (Further details of the Calvin cycle biochemistry,
including sugar regeneration, appear in Figure 15.9.)
In each “turn” of the cycle, one molecule of CO2 is condensed (combined, forming a new C–C bond) with the
five-carbon sugar ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The resulting
six-carbon intermediate splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA). The fixed CO2 ultimately ends up as
a carbon of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), reduced by
2H+ + 2e – from NADPH + H+. Recall from Chapter 13 that
NADPH is a phosphorylated derivative of NADH commonly associated with biosynthesis. The phosphoryl group
of NADPH however does not participate in energy transfer.

How does the fixed CO2 become one “corner” of a glucose molecule? For every three turns of the cycle, fixing
three molecules of CO2, the cycle feeds one molecule of
G3P (C3H5O3 –PO32–) into biosynthesis:
3CO2 + 6 NA DPH + 6H+ + 9 ATP + 9H 2O →
C3H5O3 –PO32– + 6 NADP+ + 9 ADP + 8 Pi
The H 2O and the phosphoryl group of G3P are ultimately recycled during biosynthetic assimilation of G3P.
Two molecules of G3P may condense (that is, form a new
C–C bond) in a pathway to synthesize glucose. The overall
condensation of 6CO2 → 2 G3P → glucose yields:
6CO2 + 12 NA DPH + 12H+ + 18 ATP + 18H 2O →
C6H12O6 + 12 NADP+ + 18 ADP + 18 Pi
Alternatively, instead of conversion to glucose, G3P can
enter the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids, vitamins,
and other essential components of cells. Glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate is the fundamental unit of carbon assimilation
into biomass.

key enzyme of the Calvin cycle. The CO2-fi xing enzyme
is unique to bacteria and chloroplasts. Some archaeal
genomes do show a homolog of Rubisco, but the archaeal
enzyme does not fi x CO2. Instead, the archaeal Rubisco
forms PGA out of adenine, through a “scavenging pathway” of catabolism.
The structure of Rubisco is highly conserved across
bacterial and chloroplast domains. It consists of two types
of subunits, designated small and large (Fig. 15.8A).
The large (L) subunit contains the active (catalytic) site.
The function of the small (S) subunit remains unclear;
some bacteria, such as Rhodospirillum rubrum, have a
Rubisco with no small subunits. Different species contain

to one three-carbon product.

1. Carboxylation and splitting: 6C → 2[3C]. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate condenses with CO2 and H2O,
mediated by Rubisco. Rubisco generates a six-carbon
intermediate, which immediately hydrolyzes (splits into
two parts by incorporating H2O). The split produces
two molecules of PGA, one of which contains the CO2
fixed by this cycle.
2. Reduction of PGA to G3P. The carboxyl group of
each PGA molecule is phosphorylated by ATP. The
phosphorylated carboxyl group is then hydrolyzed and
reduced by NADPH, forming G3P.
3. Regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. Of every

five G3P enter a complex series of reactions (including hydrolysis of 3 ATP) to regenerate three molecules
of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The net conversion

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

different multiples of the small and large subunits: eight
(in lithotrophs, green phototrophs, and some algae), six
(in plant chloroplasts and some algae), or two (in purple phototrophs). Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanism of CO2 fixation in all these organisms appears to
be similar.
Initially, Rubisco adds CO2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate
to give an unstable six-carbon intermediate that remains
bound to the enzyme (Fig. 15.8B and C). The intermediate hydrolyzes into two molecules of PGA, each held at the
active site by its phosphate. Only one PGA molecule contains a carbon from the newly fixed CO2; nevertheless, as
both molecules dissociate from the enzyme, they enter the
cellular pool of PGA and behave equivalently in the rest of
the cycle.
Rubisco has a high affinity for CO2, and the typical concentration of Rubisco active sites (one per large subunit,
six per complex) in plant chloroplasts is 4 mM—about
500 times greater than the concentration of CO2. Thus,
considerable energy is invested in CO2 absorption. Yet
the efficiency of carbon fixation by Rubisco is lowered by
the existence of a competing reaction with O2 that leads
to 2-phosphoglycolate instead of 3-phosphoglycerate. This
oxygenation reaction is called photorespiration. The function of photorespiration has been studied intensively, but
remains unclear.

Thought Question

15.2 Speculate on why Rubisco catalyzes a competing reaction with oxygen. Why might researchers be unsuccessful in
attempting to engineer Rubisco without this reaction?

Regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. Overall, each

glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) arises from three rounds
of CO2 fi xation by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. Thus, to
maintain the cycle, for each G3P provided to biosynthesis,
five other molecules of G3P must be recycled into three
five-carbon molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. Details
of regenerating the intermediate are shown in the lower
half of Figure 15.9.
The regeneration pathway is summarized here:
■

Two molecules of G3P condense to form the six-carbon
sugar fructose 6-phosphate.

■

Fructose 6-phosphate condenses with a third G3P. The
nine-carbon molecule splits to form a five-carbon sugar
(xylulose 5-phosphate) and a four-carbon sugar (erythrose 4-phosphate). Xylulose 5-phosphate rearranges to
ribulose 5-phosphate.

■

Erythrose 4-phosphate condenses with a fourth G3P
(rearranged to dihydroxyacetone 3-phosphate) to make
a seven-carbon sugar (sedoheptulose 7-phosphate).

■

The seven-carbon sugar condenses with the fifth G3P
and splits into two molecules of the ribulose 5-phosphate (via xylulose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate).

■

Each of the three five-carbon sugars receives a second phosphoryl group from ATP, generating ribulose
1,5-bisphosphate. Each ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is now
ready for Rubisco to fi x another CO2.

Why would a cycle have evolved requiring so many enzymatic steps to so many different intermediates? First, a cycle
with many steps breaks down the energy flow into numerous reversible conversions with near-zero values of ΔG. The
nearer to equilibrium, the more energy is conserved in the
conversion. Second, the multiple different intermediates
provide substrates for biosynthesis. For example, some molecules of erythrose 4-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate are
withdrawn from the cycle to build aromatic amino acids
and nucleotides.

Thought Questions

15.3 Why does ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate have to contain two
phosphoryl groups, whereas the other intermediates of the
Calvin cycle contain only one?
15.4 Which catabolic pathway (see Chapter 13) includes

some of the same sugar-phosphate intermediates that the
Calvin cycle has? What might these intermediates in common
suggest about the evolution of the two pathways?

Regulation of the Calvin Cycle

How is the Calvin cycle organized and regulated? Expression of the CO2-fixing enzymes varies with CO2 concentration, light levels (for phototrophs), and temperature. The
concentration of CO2 is a special problem because CO2
diffuses readily through phospholipid membranes. Thus,
cells cannot concentrate this substrate across the cell membrane to reach the level needed to drive Rubisco. The gas
concentration problem is solved by some species through
enzymatic conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate (HCO3 –),
which is trapped in the cytoplasm, unable to leak out of the
cell membrane. This enzyme system is called the carbonconcentrating mechanism (CCM). Other bacteria use
alternative CO2-fixing systems adapted to different CO2
concentrations.
Carboxysomes contain Rubisco. Many organisms that
fi x CO2 contain the Rubisco complex within subcellular

as within cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. A carboxysome consists of a polyhedral shell of protein subunits
surrounding tightly packed molecules of Rubisco. The

the bicarbonate is immediately converted to CO2 by the
enzyme carbonic anhydrase. The CO2 is then fi xed by
Rubisco to PGA—the fi rst step of CO2 fi xation (shown in
Fig. 15.9). The PGA exits the carboxysome to complete

Rubisco catalyzes the condensation of CO2 with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The six-carbon intermediate
immediately splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA), which are activated by ATP and reduced by
NADPH to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).
One of every six G3P is converted to glucose or
amino acids. The other five molecules of G3P undergo

minute quantities of mRNA using the enzyme reverse transcriptase followed by the polymerase chain reaction (discussed in Section 12.2). In RT PCR, the RNA transcripts
are reverse-transcribed to DNA; the DNA is then amplified by PCR to generate a detectable product. RNA transcripts are obtained for genes expressed before and after
CO2 limitation. The sbtA and cmpA transcripts, encoding
HCO3 – transporters, show particularly strong induction
by CO2 (Fig. 15.12). By contrast, the transcript for the
constitutive low-affinity CO2 transporter, ndhF4, shows no
induction.
Instead of carboxysomes, some phototrophs possess alternative systems of CO2 uptake and concentration adapted to different levels of CO2. For example,
the purple phototroph Rhodobacter sphaeroides has
two unlinked operons, each encoding a different set of
CO2 fixation genes, called form I and form II. Form I
and form II each encodes all the key enzymes, such as
Rubisco. When CO2 is limiting, form I enzymes work
best; when CO2 levels are saturating, form II enzymes
work best.

To Summarize
■

■

The Calvin cycle fixes CO2 by reductive condensation
with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The Calvin cycle is used
by cyanobacteria and chloroplasts and by some lithotrophs and photoheterotrophs.

15.3

CO2 Fixation: Diverse
Pathways

We have seen how oxygenic phototrophs and some lithoautotrophs fix CO2 by the Calvin cycle. Other bacteria, however, fix CO2 by alternative means (see Table 15.1). From
the standpoint of evolution and phylogenetic distribution,
the most ancient pathways are the reductive, or reverse,
TCA cycle of anaerobic phototrophs and the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway of methanogens. Diverse kinds of CO2
fixation play essential roles in soil, aquatic, and wetland
ecosystems, as well as in the digestive systems of animals
such as cattle.

The Reductive, or Reverse, TCA Cycle

All major groups of organisms run the TCA cycle, or
some part of it (discussed in Section 13.6). Most of the
individual reaction steps of the TCA cycle are reversible
because each has a relatively small ΔG of reaction. Thus,
the steps that release CO2 in the forward direction may
assimilate small amounts of CO2 in the reverse direction.
Furthermore, all organisms, including humans, fix small
amounts of CO2 through special reactions that regenerate TCA cycle intermediates. These regeneration steps
are called anaplerotic reactions. Common anaplerotic
reactions are the formation of oxaloacetate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), catalyzed by PEP carboxylase;
and the formation of malate from pyruvate, catalyzed by
malic enzyme.
In some anaerobic bacteria and archaea, the entire TCA
cycle functions in “reverse,” reducing CO2 to generate

The coenzyme A is recycled as the acetyl group enters
biosynthesis. For example, acetyl-CoA can assimilate
another CO2 with reduction to pyruvate. Pyruvate then
builds up to glucose and related sugars by gluconeogenesis
(reverse glycolysis), with expenditure of ATP and NADPH.
Alternatively, acetyl-CoA can enter biosynthetic pathways
to produce fatty acids or amino acids.

CHAPTER 15

Unlike the Calvin cycle, the reverse TCA cycle provides
several different molecular intermediates that can assimilate
CO2. Here are the key steps:
■

Succinyl-CoA assimilates CO2 to form 2-oxoglutarate
(alpha-ketoglutarate).

■

2-Oxoglutarate assimilates CO2 to form isocitrate.

■

Acetyl-CoA (produced by the reverse TCA cycle) assimilates CO2 to form pyruvate.

Each CO2 assimilation requires one or more reduction steps. 2-Oxoglutarate is reduced by the protein ferredoxin (FdH 2). FdH 2 also mediates acetyl-CoA reduction
to pyruvate. Other reduction steps may be accomplished by
NADPH or NADH.

The Acetyl-CoA Pathway

Yet another route for CO2 assimilation into acetyl-CoA
and pyruvate is the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway
(Fig. 15.14). In the acetyl-CoA pathway, two CO2 molecules are condensed through converging pathways to form
the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA pathway is

used by anaerobic soil bacteria, such as Clostridium thermoaceticum, and by most autotrophic sulfate reducers, such
as Desulfobacterium autotrophicum. It also provides the
main source of biomass for methanogens. Most of the CO2
absorbed by methanogens is used to yield energy by reducing CO2 to methane (discussed in Chapter 14). However,
5% of the CO2 absorbed by a methanogen enters the acetylCoA pathway for biosynthesis, generating the entire biomass of the organism.
The substrates and ultimate products of the acetyl-CoA
pathway are the same as those of the reverse TCA cycle,
except that the reducing agent is H 2 instead of NADPH.
The acetyl-CoA pathway is slightly more efficient than the
TCA cycle, requiring one less ATP:
2CO2 + ATP + 4H 2 + HS-CoA →
CH3CO-S-CoA + 3H 2O + ADP + Pi
Nevertheless, the order of the pathway and its intermediate
compounds are completely different from those of the TCA
cycle. The reductive acetyl-CoA pathway is linear, with no
recycled intermediates.

CHAPTER 15

One place where methanogens fix CO2 and release methane is the bovine rumen, or digestive fermentation chamber (see Chapter 21). Within the rumen, bacteria convert
cattle feed into CO2 and H 2, and methanogens divert a significant portion of these gases into methane. The methane
then escapes through burping and flatulence. If methanogen growth could be prevented, the CO2 and H 2 could be
fixed by other microbes into fermentation acids assimilated
by the rumen. Beef production would then release less of
the greenhouse gas methane.

The 3-Hydroxypropionate Cycle

The green photoheterotroph Chloroflexus aurantiacus fixes
CO2 yet another way: by the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle
(Fig. 15.15A). Chloroflexus bacteria are filamentous thermophiles that absorb light at longer wavelengths than cyanobacteria and often grow below cyanobacteria in thick mats
of biofilm (Fig. 15.15B). The 3-hydroxypropionate cycle is
also used by archaea, such as the thermoacidophile Acidianus
brierleyi and the aerobic sulfur oxidizer Sulfolobus metallicus.
In the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, CO2 is fixed by acetylCoA into 3-hydroxypropionate (Fig. 15.15A). Acetyl-CoA
condenses with hydrated CO2 (bicarbonate ion, HCO3 –)
and is reduced by 2 NADPH to 3-hydroxypropionate.
Condensation with a second molecule of HCO3 – forms
methylmalonyl-CoA, followed by several intermediates to
malyl-CoA. These intermediates were detected by [14C]
acetate incorporation into the metabolism of Chloroflexus
(Fig. 15.15C). The intermediates were separated by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Malyl-CoA releases a molecule of acetyl-CoA to renew
the cycle, plus glyoxylate. Glyoxylate condenses with a third
HCO3 – to form pyruvate, which enters standard routes for
biosynthesis of sugars and amino acids. Thus, in all, the
cycle fixes three molecules of CO2 into one molecule of
pyruvate. Pyruvate then serves as a substrate to build carbohydrates and amino acids.

BIOSYNTHESIS

Biosynthesis of Fatty
Acids and Polyketides

The biosynthesis of cell parts begins with small, versatile
substrates such as acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is a product of
catabolic pathways such as glycolysis and benzoate catabolism (see Sections 13.5 and 13.6). The acetyl group also
forms anabolically from the reverse TCA cycle (Fig. 15.13).
A key pathway of biosynthesis assembles acetyl-CoA into
fatty acids. Fatty acids then condense with glycerol to form
the phospholipids of cell membranes and the lipid components of envelope proteins. Fatty acid biosynthesis provides
targets for antimicrobial drugs such as triclosan, an inhibitor of enoyl-ACP reductase. Related condensation pathways
yield materials such as polyesters and polyketide antibiotics,
such as tetracycline.
The repeating form of fatty acids, polyketides, and polyesters enables long-chain molecules to be synthesized with
a relatively small number of different enzymes. By contrast, other cell components, such as amino acids, have
more complex nonrepeating structures whose biosynthetic
enzymes require long operons (presented in Section 15.6).

Fatty Acids Are Built from
Repeating Units

Fatty acids exemplify the construction of cell components
from repeating units (Fig. 15.16). The construction of
molecules based on repeating units requires a cyclic pathway that feeds its products back repeatedly as substrates
for further synthesis. The advantage of a cyclic process is
that large polymers can be made with a limited number of
enzymes; for example, the mycolic acids of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis are extended to lengths of over 100 carbons.
While fatty acid structures used by cells include many
different forms (discussed in Chapter 3), their synthesis
always begins with the successive addition of two-carbon
acetyl groups. Thus, most fatty acids contain an even number of carbon atoms.
The fatty acid synthase complex. The cyclic process of

fatty acid synthesis is managed by the fatty acid synthase
complex. The complex contains all the enzymes and component binding proteins bound together in proximity, so
that all steps proceed in one place without “losing” the
unfi nished molecule. The main bacterial version of this
complex is designated FASII. All of the components are
essential for viability and thus are potential drug targets.
Analogous multienzyme complexes are used by actinomycete bacteria to synthesize other long-chain products, such
as polyketide antibiotics.

Activation of acetyl-CoA. Most acetyl groups within the

cell are “tagged” with coenzyme A (CoA), a cofactor that
directs acetate into catabolic pathways such as the TCA
cycle. To redirect acetyl groups into fatty acid biosynthesis,
acetyl-CoA molecules are fi rst tagged at the “back end” by
condensation with CO2 (Fig. 15.16A, step 1), catalyzed
by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The addition of CO2 in this step
does not count as carbon fi xation, because the CO2 added
does not permanently add to the carbon skeleton. Instead,
like phosphate or CoA, the CO2 exists to be displaced when
its function is no longer required. The CO2-tagged acetylCoA is called malonyl-CoA. The coenzyme A is replaced by
acyl carrier protein (ACP), making malonyl-ACP (step 2).

Fatty acid
acid. Units of acetyl-CoA are
carboxylated to malonyl-CoA,
and then successively condense
to form the long chain of a fatty acid. Each two-carbon unit requires
reduction by 2 NADPH. B. An alkene “kink” can be left unsaturated
during chain extension. The double bond then forms between the
third and fourth carbons, rather than the second and third. In this
position, the double bond escapes reduction as the chain lengthens
through subsequent cycles of malonyl addition.

(Fig. 15.16A), malonyl-ACP hooks onto the head of an
acetyl-ACP or a longer-growing chain. The process of
hooking onto the new unit involves displacement of CO2
from the back end of malonyl-ACP, which replaces ACP
from the front end of the growing chain. The growing
chain now contains a ketone (at carbon 3, from the former acetyl group). The ketone is reduced by NADPH and
dehydrated, forming an alkene (C =C, unsaturated double bond between adjacent carbons 2 and 3). The alkene is
further reduced by a second NADPH (steps 4–6). In all,
the chain gains 4H+ + 4e – and is now fully hydrogenated
(saturated).
Once hydrogenated, the chain is ready to take on the
next malonyl-ACP, which, as before, loses CO2 and replaces
the ACP from the front of the growing chain (return to
step 3). Successive addition can continue many times to
build a saturated fatty acid.

CHAPTER 15
Unsaturation. Certain fatty acids require unsaturated “kinks”

in the chain (alkenes) to serve a structural purpose, such as to
increase the fluidity of the membrane. Unsaturation can be
generated during a cycle of elongation (Fig. 15.16A, step 5).
During the first four cycles of acetyl addition, an alkene bond
forms between the second and third carbons of the fatty acid.
After the fifth two-carbon addition, however, a special dehydratase enzyme generates the alkene double bond between
the third and fourth carbons (Fig. 15.16B). This alkene fails
to be hydrogenated further. Instead, several additional malonyl units are added, generating a long-chain fatty acid with a
kink of a cis double bond.
Regulation of fatty acid synthesis. The synthesis of fatty

acids consumes enormous quantities of reducing energy;
thus, cells must regulate it to avoid waste. From a structural standpoint, production of fatty acids incorporated
into membranes must be balanced with growth of the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the many different variants of fatty
acids are regulated in response to particular environmental
needs. Some mechanisms of regulation include:
■

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase represses its own transcription. Transcription of an operon encoding two subunits
of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AccB, AccC) is repressed
by one of its subunits, protein AccB. As AccB increases
in concentration, it binds the promoter of the accBC
operon, repressing further transcription. Thus, initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis (Fig. 15.16A, step 1) is
always limited by the amount of AccB and AccC enzyme
subunits that are present.

■

Starvation blocks fatty acid biosynthesis. Starvation
for carbon sources blocks fatty acid biosynthesis through
the “stringent response.” Blockage is mediated by the
polyphosphorylated nucleotide ppGpp (guanosine tetraphosphate), the global regulator of the stringent
response (discussed in Section 10.2).

■

Temperature regulates fatty acid composition. Bacterial fatty acid composition is regulated by environmental
factors such as temperature. In E. coli, low temperature
favors unsaturated fatty acids because they are less rigid
and maintain membrane flexibility. Low temperature
induces expression of the gene fabA encoding the dehydratase enzyme that desaturates the fatty acid bond. As
the dehydratase activity is increased, more unsaturated
fatty acids are made.

Thought Question

15.5 For a given species, uniform thickness of a cell membrane requires uniform chain length of its fatty acids. How do
you think chain length may be regulated?

■

BIOSYNTHESIS

■

585

Cyclic pathways of elongation comparable to fatty acid
biosynthesis are used to build other kinds of polymers for
energy storage. For example, many bacteria synthesize
polyesters such as polyhydroxybutyrate. The term “polyester” indicates the multiple ester groups that are formed
by repeated esterification of the carboxylic acid group of
the chain with the hydroxyl group of a new alkanoate unit.
Polyesters are insoluble in water, so they collect as storage
granules within the bacterial cell, ready to release stored
energy when needed. Polyester granules are synthesized
by human pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, the
cause of legionellosis. Polyester storage helps L. pneumophila survive in water sources such as air-conditioning
units. Commercially, polyesters produced by soil bacteria
such as Ralstonia eutropha are used to manufacture biodegradable surgical sutures.

Polyketide Antibiotics

The cyclic biosynthesis of fatty acids provides clues to
the biosynthesis of a famous family of antibiotics, the
polyketides. A well-known polyketide is erythromycin, a
broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribed for bacterial pneumonia and chlamydia infections (Fig. 15.17). Erythromycin
blocks bacterial translation at the step of peptide elongation
(see Chapter 8). Polyketides are secondary products produced by actinomycetes, as discussed earlier.
The synthesis of polyketide antibiotics involves cyclic
elongation by an enormous enzyme complex called a modular enzyme, which consists of multiple modules that add
similar but nonidentical units to a growing chain. Like
fatty acids, polyketides are built by the successive condensation of malonyl-ACP units, but each malonyl group carries a unique extension, or R group, instead of a CO2. In
erythromycin, the R groups are all methyl groups. In other
polyketides, the R groups range from hydroxyl groups and
amides to aromatic rings, some of which undergo secondary reactions and interconnections.
How is the order of different R groups determined? The
modular enzyme contains a series of active sites, or modules, each of which catalyzes the addition of one of a series
of units. Each module contains all the enzyme activities
needed to add the unit and recognizes a unit with one specific R group. The modular polyketide synthase may consist of a single protein with a series of domains, or it may
consist of a complex of several protein subunits. Either the
multidomain enzyme or the complex acts as an assembly
line to generate the specific polyketide.
Figure 15.17A and B show the chain extension synthesis of a polyketide. The initial two domains of enzyme 1
are acyltransferase (AT) and an acyl carrier protein (ACP)
domain, analogous to the ACP of fatty acid biosynthesis
but specialized to accept one component of the polyketide.

The acyltransferase transfers the acyl group (R 1-acetyl)
from R 1-acetyl-CoA onto the ACP, with release of coenzyme A (HS-CoA). The R 1-acetyl is then transferred to a
ketosynthase domain (KS).
Meanwhile, a malonyl group with its own R group
(R 2-malonyl) has been transferred by a second AT onto the
second ACP domain (Fig. 15.17B). The R 1-acetyl group
then leaves KS and condenses with R 2-malonyl-ACP, releasing CO2. The R 1R 2 acyl chain subsequently undergoes a
series of extensions by R-malonyl groups (Fig. 15.17C). For
erythromycin, all R groups are methyl; other polyketides
have R groups that are more complex. The initial AT and
ACP domains constitute a “loading module” for the first
acyl group, whereas subsequent sets of domains constitute
“extender modules” that each add a different R-malonyl
group. Extender modules can include secondary activities
such as dehydratase (DH; removes OH) and ketoreductase

(KR; hydrogenates a ketone to OH). In principle, the modular approach can construct a limitless range of products
with diverse antibiotic properties.
Elongation of the polyketide is terminated by thioesterase (TE), which hydrolyzes the thioester bond to the final
ACP. This polyketide chain is an erythromycin precursor.
The precursor requires additional enzymes (not shown)
to add extra components, including two sugars (glycosylation). Sugar addition completes the erythromycin.
Another remarkable class of antibiotics formed on modular enzymes consists of polypeptides made without a ribosome. An example of a nonribosomal peptide antibiotic is
ristocetin (see the Current Research Highlight). The biosynthesis of an important nonribosomal peptide antibiotic,
vancomycin, is presented in eTopic 15.4. Modular enzyme
biosynthesis of peptide antibiotics offers exciting prospects
for the design of new drugs (see Special Topic 15.1).

The growing acyl chain is hydrogenated. Each added
unit is hydrogenated by two molecules of NADPH,
unless an unsaturated kink is required.
Some fatty acids are partly unsaturated. An unsaturated kink may be generated by a special dehydratase,
which generates the alkene double bond between the
third and fourth carbons.
Fatty acid biosynthesis is regulated by the levels of
acetyl-CoA carboxylase and by the stringent response to
carbon starvation. Bond saturation is regulated by temperature and other environmental factors.

Note:

Bacteria and archaea play essential roles in global cycling
of nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. The geochemical cycling of
these elements is discussed in Chapter 22.

Polyesters for energy storage are synthesized by cyclic
elongation of alkanoates.

Nitrogen Assimilation

To fix nitrogen into biomass, bacteria or archaea must
reduce the nitrogen completely to ammonia (NH3). At
pH 7, ammonia is mostly protonated to ammonium ion
(NH4+). Unlike carbon, nitrogen rarely appears in oxidized
form in complex biomolecules. Inorganic forms, such as
nitric oxide (NO), are used as defense mechanisms against
invading pathogens (see Chapter 23) or as signaling molecules. In macromolecules, however, virtually all the nitrogen is reduced; organic compounds containing oxidized
nitrogen are generally toxic.
While N2 is the ultimate source and sink of biospheric
nitrogen, several oxidized or reduced forms are found in the
environment, produced by living organisms (Fig. 15.18).
Most free-living bacteria can acquire nitrate (NO3 –) or
nitrite (NO2 –) for reduction to ammonium ion. Even
nitrogen-fixing legume symbionts, such as Rhizobium, can
use nitrate.

Polyketide antibiotics are synthesized by modular
enzymes. Nonribosomal peptide antibiotics are also
made by modular enzymes.

Nitrogen Fixation
and Regulation

The synthesis of amino acids, cell walls, and other cofactors requires an additional element we have not yet considered—namely, nitrogen. In principle, nitrogen should
be more accessible to cells than carbon is, since nitrogen
4H+ + 3e–

3H2O

BIOSYNTHESIS

gas (N2) comprises more than three-quarters of our
atmosphere. In fact, however, N2 , with its triple bond, is
one of the most stable molecules in nature. An enormous
input of energy is required to reduce nitrogen to ammonia for assimilation into carbon skeletons. Early in evolution, all cells may have fixed their own N2 , but today
only certain species of bacteria and archaea retain the
ability. All other organisms depend on reduced or oxidized forms of nitrogen, which ultimately derive from
N2. Thus, all living organisms, directly or indirectly,
depend on N2-fixing prokaryotes within the biosphere
(discussed in Chapters 21 and 22). Nitrogen limits
microbes in many ecosystems, such as aquatic algae in
lakes.

Fatty acid biosynthesis involves successive condensation of malonyl-ACP groups formed from acetyl groups
tagged with acyl carrier protein (ACP) and a carboxylate.
Each successive malonyl group is transferred onto the
growing acyl chain, with release of CO2.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

SPECIAL TOPIC 15.1- - Mining a Bacterial Genome for Peptide Antibiotics
Bacteria synthesize a vast array of peptide products that serve
the functions of development, communication, and combat.
These peptides have unique modifications that depart from
the standard 20 amino acid residues. Some peptides are
translated by ribosomes and then modified, whereas others,
the nonribosomal peptides, are synthesized entirely by modular enzymes comparable to those that make polyketides.
Nonribosomal peptides include powerful antibiotics such as
vancomycin (eTopic 15.4) and immunosuppressant drugs
such as cyclosporine.
As resistance evolves, in our arms race with pathogens,
we always need more new antibiotics. The stendomycins
are an emerging class of lipopeptides (peptides attached
to lipid) that have antifungal activity (Fig. 1). Where do we
find them? We can mine the genomes of the ever-evolving
strains of bacteria in our environment, which undergo their
own arms races with each other. The challenge is (1) to
detect previously unknown antibiotics within cells—a chemical “needle in the haystack”—and (2) to reveal the genes
encoding their biosynthetic enzymes. The genes can then
be cloned in an engineered fermenter strain (discussed in
Chapter 16).
So which clues come first—the peptide or the biosynthetic genes? Either the peptide or the gene sequence may
offer a clue, which then serves to interrogate the other side.

A multistep interactive approach between peptide and gene
was devised by Pieter Dorrestein and colleagues at UC San
Diego (Fig. 2). The approach is called peptidogenomics. Figure 3 outlines the peptidogenomic approach that identified
the structure and biosynthetic genes for stendomycin I–VI, an
antifungal agent produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces
hygroscopicus.
Stendomycin was the first antibiotic identified in S. hygroscopicus by a version of mass spectrometry called MALDI-TOF
(matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization–time-offlight). In the MALDI technique, a UV laser beam is trained on
a sample embedded in a chemical matrix. A thin portion of
sample plus matrix is “desorbed”—that is, ionized—and the
ions are taken up into the mass spectrometer. The “time of
flight” into the detector offers a measure of the size of the
ionized molecules.
For Dorrestein’s work, the MALDI laser was aimed at a
matrix-embedded colony of S. hygroscopicus. Fragments of
thousands of molecules were generated, among them components with sizes characteristic of certain uniquely modified
amino acids that appear only in nonribosomal peptides, such
as dehydroalanine. In addition, the fragments predicted the
existence of a peptide containing eight amino acids, whose
sequence did not match any translated sequence within
the S. hygroscopicus genome. The data were consistent

synthesize one version of the peptide: Gly-Val-Ile-Ala-ThrThr-Val-Val. This peptide proved to be the backbone of the
lipopeptide stendomycin I–VI (Fig. 1). Note that in the mature
lipopeptide, other enzymes have catalyzed various modifications, such as an ester linkage between the carboxyl terminus
and the hydroxyl group of a threonine residue.
The full structure of stendomycin I–VI was identified and
confirmed by back-and-forth testing between models predicted by the mass spectrometry fragments and by gene
cluster analysis. The method is now being used to identify
many other peptide products. We can only hope that our rate
of drug discovery outpaces the rate of resistance arising in
pathogens.

■ Nitrogen fixation requires specialized structures. Anabaena spiroides, a filamentous cyanobacterium, segregates
N2 fixation in heterocysts, cells that do not photosynthesize and thus maintain anoxic conditions.

In natural environments, most potential sources of
nitrogen are subject to competition from dissimilatory
metabolism in which the molecule is oxidized or reduced
for energy, as discussed in Chapter 14. For example, anaerobic respirers convert nitrate and nitrite to N2 (denitrification), whereas lithotrophs oxidize NH4+ to nitrite and
nitrate (nitrification). An important consequence of nitrification is that most of the commercial ammonia fertilizer
spread on agricultural fields is soon oxidized by lithotrophs
to nitrates and nitrites. High concentrations of nitrates in
water are harmful because they combine with hemoglobin, generating a form that cannot take up oxygen. When
infants drink water with high nitrite, they may become ill
with “blue baby syndrome.”

Nitrogen Fixation: Early Discoveries

The first nitrogen fixers, discovered by Martinus Beijerinck and colleagues in the late 1800s, were soil and
wetland bacteria such as Beggiatoa and Azotobacter. Species of Rhizobium were discovered to fix nitrogen as
endosymbionts of leguminous plants (see Chapter 21).
For several decades, it was believed that N2 was fixed
only by a few special bacteria in the soil or in symbiotic
plant bacteria. But in the 1940s, Martin Kamen and colleagues noticed that phototrophs such as Rhodospirillum
rubrum produce hydrogen gas—a known by-product of
nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation was hard to demonstrate reliably in the laboratory because at that time
researchers did not know that in R. rubrum, nitrogen
fixation is repressed by the presence of alternative nitrogen sources, such as ammonia. When traces of ammonia and other nitrogen sources were eliminated, Kamen’s
student Herta Bregoff found that these photosynthetic
bacteria actually fix nitrogen.
Nitrogen is now known to be fixed by most phototrophic bacteria (green and purple bacteria, as well as

cyanobacteria) and by many archaea. Marine cyanobacteria fix a large proportion of both the nitrogen and carbon dioxide assimilated by our biosphere. To fix N2,
aquatic cyanobacteria such as Anabaena develop special
cells called heterocysts, in which photosynthesis is turned
off to maintain anaerobic conditions (Fig. 15.19). Land
ecosystems require nitrogen-fixing bacteria and archaea in
the soil, often in mutualistic relationships with plants. For
example, the bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum associates with the roots of soybean plants, causing them to
grow nodules. The nodules contain “bacteroids,” forms
of the bacteria that grow within the root cells. The bacteroids release extra nitrogen into the soil; for this reason,
farmers alternate soy crops with nitrogen-intensive crops
such as corn. Nitrogen-fixing mutualism is discussed in
Chapter 21.
Bacterial nitrogen fixation, however, has not sufficed to
drive modern high-yield agriculture. Industrial nitrogen
fixation uses the Haber process, in which nitrogen gas is
hydrogenated by methane (natural gas) to form ammonia,
under extreme heat and pressure. Scientists estimate that
the Haber process reduces more atmospheric N2 than all
of Earth’s other processes combined. While this amount
of nitrogen represents a small fraction of the atmosphere,
the environmental effects are huge, polluting waterways
and causing marine areas of hypoxia called “dead zones”
(discussed in Chapters 21 and 22). The anthropogenic
(human-caused) influx of nitrogen into the biosphere is an
astonishing example of the influence of human society on
our planet.

The Mechanism of Nitrogen Fixation

In living cells, nitrogen fixation is an enormously energyintensive process. The mechanism is largely conserved
across species:
N2 + 8H+ + 8e – + 16 ATP → 2NH3 + H 2 + 16 ADP + 16 Pi

CHAPTER 15

The electrons are donated by NADH, H2, or
pyruvate, or obtained through photosynthesis.
The total energy investment includes approximately 3 ATP-equivalents per 2e –, plus 16 ATP
molecules as shown. That makes 12 + 16 = 28
ATP in all—a large part of the energy gained
from oxidation of glucose. The production of
H2 is surprising, as it consumes extra ATP.
Hydrogen loss results from initiating the cycle
of nitrogen reduction (discussed shortly). Some
bacteria have secondary reactions to reclaim the
lost hydrogen with part of its lost energy.

Nitrogenase reaction mechanism. The overall

conversion of nitrogen gas to two molecules of
ammonia is catalyzed in four cycles by nitrogenase, an enzyme highly conserved in nearly
all nitrogen-fi xing species. Nitrogenase probably evolved once in a common ancestor of all
nitrogen-fi xing organisms.
The mechanism of nitrogenase is of intense interest to
agricultural scientists because of the potential benefits
of improving efficiency of plant growth and of extending nitrogen-fixing symbionts to nonleguminous plants
such as corn. In 1960, scientists at the DuPont laboratory
first isolated the nitrogenase complex from a bacterium,
Clostridium pasteurianum. They measured its activity
by incorporating heavy-isotope nitrogen gas, 15N2, into
15
NH3. Since then, the detailed structure of nitrogenase
has been solved (Fig. 15.20).
The active nitrogenase complex includes two kinds of
subunits encoded by different genes: Fe protein (shaded
green in Fig. 15.20), containing a [4Fe-4S] center;
and FeMo protein (shaded cyan), containing iron and
molybdenum. The Fe protein contains a typical [4Fe4S] structure to facilitate electron transfer. As we learned
in Chapter 14, metal atoms help to transfer electrons
because their orbitals are closely spaced and transitions
between these orbitals involve relatively small amounts of
energy. The electrons are funneled through a second Fe-S
cluster (the P cluster) to the FeMo (iron-molybdenum)
cluster. The FeMo cluster is an unusual structural characteristic of nitrogenase, in which trios of sulfur atoms
alternate with trios of iron atoms. One end of the cluster
is capped with another iron, and the other end is capped
with an atom of molybdenum (Mo). A consequence of
the nitrogenase structure is that most nitrogen-fixing

Nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. The enzyme nitrogenase successively reduces nitrogen by electron transfer, ATP

hydrolysis, and H+ incorporation.

Four cycles of reduction. Nitrogen fi xation requires four
reduction cycles through nitrogenase (Fig. 15.21).
To initiate the first cycle of N2 reduction, 2e – from an
electron donor such as NADH or H2 are transferred by a
ferredoxin to Fe protein. The reduced Fe protein transfers
each electron to the FeMo center, with energy supplied by
four molecules of ATP (Fig. 15.21, step 1). The FeMo protein binds 2H+, which are reduced to H2 (step 2). Only then
does N2 bind to the active site, by displacing the H2 (step 3).
In the next reduction cycle, two electrons are transferred
to Fe protein, where they reduce the iron. The reduced Fe
protein transfers each electron to the FeMo center, near the
binding site for N2. The electron transfer requires expenditure of 2 ATP per electron, or 4 ATP per 2e –. Two hydrogen ions join the N2 and receive the two electrons, forming
HN=NH.
A third pair of electrons enters the Fe protein, which
then joins another 2H+, reducing N2 to H 2N–NH 2. The
cycle again requires hydrolysis of 4 ATP. A final cycle of
electron transfer and H+ uptake reduces H 2N–NH 2 to
2NH3. At typical cytoplasmic pH values (near pH 7), NH3
is protonated to NH4+.

The loss of H 2 during nitrogen fixation is puzzling
because it represents lost energy in a highly energy-intensive process. The actual fate of the H 2 varies among species. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a Gram-negative organism in
which nitrogen regulation has been much studied, gives off
the H 2 without further reaction. On the other hand, Azotobacter uses an irreversible hydrogenase enzyme to convert H 2 back to 2H+ and recover the transferred electrons.
In leguminous rhizobial symbionts such as Sinorhizobium
species, H 2 recovery varies surprisingly among strains and
can affect the efficiency of plant growth.
Nitrogen fixation is expensive, both in terms of protein
synthesis and in terms of reducing energy and ATP. Even
bacteria capable of nitrogen fixation repress the process
in the presence of other nitrogen sources, such as nitrate
(NO3 –), nitrite (NO2 –), ammonia (NH3), and nitrogenous
organic molecules acquired from dead cells.

Anaerobiosis and N2 Fixation

The reductive action of nitrogenase is extremely sensitive
to oxygen because of the large reducing power needed to

Protective proteins. Aerobic Azotobacter
species synthesize protective proteins that
stabilize nitrogenase and prevent attack by
oxygen. For rhizobia, on the other hand,
the plant hosts produce leghemoglobin
(named for “legume” plants), a form of
hemoglobin that sequesters oxygen away
from the bacteria.

B. When cellular levels of NH4+ are
low, NtrC is phosphorylated and activates expression of nifLA. Expression
is coactivated by the nitrogen
starvation sigma factor, sigma-54.
The NifA protein (and sigma-54)
activates expression of nif genes
encoding nitrogenase. When
oxygen levels are high, however,
nitrogen fixation cannot occur, so NifA

Specialized cells for N2 fixation. Filamentous cyanobacteria develop specialized
nitrogen-fixing cells called heterocysts (see
Fig. 15.19). The heterocysts lose their photosynthetic capacity entirely and specialize in
nitrogen fixation. Heterocyst development
is directed by a complex genetic program
induced by nitrogen starvation. In natural
environments, the heterocysts leak organic
acids that attract heterotrophic bacteria,
which use up all the oxygen around the heterocyst, generating ideal anaerobic conditions for nitrogen fixation.

make NH4+. Thus, cells can fix nitrogen only
in an anaerobic environment. This is no problem for anaerobes. But oxygenic phototrophs
such as cyanobacteria face an obvious problem, as do bacterial symbionts of oxygenic
plants. Aerobic and oxygenic organisms have
developed several solutions to the problem of
fixing nitrogen in aerobic environments:

■

Nitrogen fixation costs substantial energy, and therefore
the process is regulated with extraordinary fine tuning.
Multiple factors determine the expression of genes encoding nitrogenase (nifHDKTY) and other nitrogen-fixation
proteins. Oxygen represses the expression of nif genes
because nitrogenase is inactivated by oxygen; and high
NH4+ depresses expression because enough fixed nitrogen is already available to the cell. Responses are mediated
by several molecular regulators, including a nitrogen starvation sigma factor (sigma-54) and the NtrB-NtrC twocomponent signal transduction system. (Sigma factors and
two-component regulators are discussed in Chapter 10.)
The NtrB-NtrC system was dissected in Klebsiella pneumoniae by Sydney Kustu and colleagues at UC Berkeley (Fig. 15.22A). When NH4+ is low (Fig. 15.22B), the
cell needs to fix nitrogen. The nitrogen sensor kinase NtrB

autophosphorylates (obtains a phosphoryl group from ATP).
NtrB-P then phosphorylates NtrC, forming NtrC-P, the
nitrogenase activator. The NtrC-P phosphoprotein binds an
upstream enhancer sequence to activate expression of nifLA,
making NifL and NifA proteins. Expression of nifLA is coactivated by sigma-54. Sigma-54 and the NifA protein together
activate expression of nifHDKTY to make nitrogenase. Thus,
low NH4+ concentration turns on nitrogen fixation.
When cellular levels of NH4+ are high, NtrC remains
unphosphorylated. The nifLA operon is not transcribed,
no activators bind the nifHDKTY promoter, and the nitrogen fixation genes are not expressed.
Nitrogenase activity is stopped by oxygen, so high oxygen
levels block expression of the gene. When oxygen is high,
NifA binds NifL and is prevented from binding the nitrogenase promoter. Low oxygen allows NifA to bind the promoter and express nitrogenase to fix nitrogen. Overall, NtrC
governs response to NH4+, whereas NifA governs response
to oxygen. Being responsive to multiple environmental signals is typical of energy-expensive biosynthetic pathways.

Biosynthesis of
Amino Acids and
Nitrogenous Bases

Where do microbes obtain amino acids to make their proteins and cell walls, as well as nitrogenous bases to synthesize DNA and RNA? When possible, microbes obtain these
molecules from their environment through membraneembedded transporters. But competition for such valuable
nutrients is high, especially for free-living microbes in soil
or water. Most free-living microbes and plants have the
ability to make all the standard amino acids and bases of
the genetic code, as well as nonstandard variants used for
cell walls and transfer RNAs. We can use microbial biosynthesis of amino acids in the industrial production of food
supplements, for ourselves and for farm animals.

of reducing energy. These compounds pose additional
challenges because of their unique and diversified forms,
which cannot be made by the cyclic processes that generate molecules from repeating units. Synthesis of complex,
asymmetrical molecules such as amino acids requires
many different conversions, each mediated by a different enzyme. Nevertheless, some economy is gained by
an arrangement of branched pathways in which early
intermediates are utilized to form several products
(Fig. 15.23). For example, oxaloacetate is converted to
aspartate, which can be converted to four other amino
acids.
The carbon skeletons of amino acids arise from diverse
intermediates of metabolism (see Fig. 15.23). As in fatty
acid biosynthesis, precursor molecules are channeled into
amino acid biosynthesis by specialized cofactors and reducing energy carriers such as NADPH. Note that certain
amino acids arise directly from key metabolic intermediates
(for example, glutamate from 2-oxoglutarate), whereas others must be synthesized from preformed amino acids (for
example, glutamine, proline, and arginine from glutamate).

ancient in cell evolution than those requiring more complex pathways. Five of these “ancient” amino acids—glutamate, aspartate, valine, alanine, and glycine—are the same
as those detected in meteorites, whose composition resembles that of prebiotic Earth (Fig. 15.24). These same five
amino acids also appear in early-Earth simulation experiments in which methane, ammonia, and water are heated
under reducing conditions and subjected to electrical discharge. Thus, we speculate that the first amino acids that
early cells evolved to make were the same as those that arose
spontaneously in the prebiotic chemistry of our planet.
A more subtle effect of evolution has been to adjust the
amino acid composition of proteins based on the energetic
cost of biosynthesis. Proteins that are secreted or that project outside the cell cannot be recycled; their amino acids
are ultimately lost to the cell. Thus, secreted and externally
projecting proteins have evolved to contain the “cheaper”
amino acids—that is, the amino acids whose synthesis
requires spending fewer molecules of ATP and NADPH.
This effect can be seen in the diagram of a bacterial flagellum and its attached motor, which contains extracellular as
well as cytoplasmic components, colored on a scale based
on biosynthetic “expense” (Fig. 15.25). The external and
secreted components favor less expensive amino acids, compared to the cytoplasmic components.

Assimilation of NH4+ into

The key TCA cycle intermediate 2-oxoglutarate (alphaketoglutarate) incorporates one
molecule of NH4+ at the ketone
to form glutamate. Glutamine
can combine with oxoglutarate
to produce two molecules of
glutamate. These reactions

Assimilation of NH4+

Unlike sugars and fatty acids, amino acids must assimilate another key ingredient: nitrogen. The NH4+ produced by N2 fixation or by nitrate reduction is the key
source of nitrogen for biosynthesis. But NH4+ always
exists in equilibrium with NH3, which is toxic to cells.
Moreover, NH3 travels freely through membranes, making it difficult to store NH4+ within a cell. Deprotonation
to NH3 increases as pH rises; by pH 9.2, deprotonation
reaches 50%. Even at neutral pH, a very small equilibrium
concentration of NH3 can drain NH4+ out of the cell.
Thus, cells avoid storing high levels of NH4+; instead, the
fixed nitrogen is incorporated immediately into organic
products.
2-Oxoglutarate and glutamate condense with NH4+.

In most bacteria, the main route for NH4 + assimilation is the condensation of NH4 + with 2-oxoglutarate
to form glutamate, or with glutamate to form glutamine
(Fig. 15.26). Three key enzymes interconvert these
substrates:
■

+

Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), actually named for
its reverse activity, condenses NH4+ with 2-oxoglutarate
to form glutamate. The condensation requires reduction
by NADPH.

■

Glutamine synthetase (GS or GlnA) condenses a second NH4+ with glutamate to form glutamine—a process
driven by spending one ATP.

■

Glutamate synthase (GOGAT, glutamine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase) converts 2-oxoglutarate plus
glutamine into two molecules of glutamate. Different
variants of this enzyme use different reducing agents:
NADPH, NADH, or ferredoxin. The NADPH variant
is shown in Figure 15.26.

Through these reactions, all three substrates exchange
amino groups readily. High nitrogen levels induce GDH
to take up NH4+, but repress GS and GOGAT. GS has a

higher affinity than GDH for NH4+. Low nitrogen levels
induce GS (to make glutamine) and GOGAT (to convert
some glutamine to glutamate as needed).
Both glutamate and glutamine contribute an amine,
as well as their carbon skeletons, to the synthesis of other
amino acids in the biosynthetic “tree.” The transfer of
ammonia between two metabolites such as glutamate and
glutamine is called transamination. Many other pairs of
amino acids and metabolic intermediates undergo transamination. For example, glutamate transfers NH3 to oxaloacetate, making aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate; the reaction
can also be reversed. In another example, valine transfers an amine group to pyruvate, generating alanine and
2-ketoisovalerate.

Thought Question

15.6 Suggest two reasons why transamination is advantageous to cells.

Glutamate and Glutamine
Signal Nitrogen Availability

The cellular levels of glutamate and glutamine act as indicators of nitrogen availability. When nitrogen is scarce,
NtrC is phosphorylated to NtrC-P as we saw earlier in Figure 15.22. Along with nitrogenase, NtrC-P up-regulates
expression of glutamine synthetase (Fig. 15.27), as well as
a high-affinity ammonia transporter, and transporters for
organic sources of nitrogen such as amino acids, oligopeptides, and cell wall fragments containing amino sugars. All
these molecules can be “scavenged” to obtain nitrogen for
biosynthesis.
When ammonium ion (NH4+) is abundant, cells store
the nitrogen safely as glutamine, via glutamine synthetase (GlnA) (Fig. 15.27). GlnA uses the energy released
from ATP hydrolysis to assimilate NH4+ into glutamic
acid and produce glutamine. But what if the cell makes
too much active GlnA? Then all of the cell’s glutamate

shortage, excess glutamine signals the cell to stop making
GlnA and inactivate whatever GlnA is already present. To
maintain the balance requires an intricate series of regulators responding to low glutamine or to high glutamine
(Fig. 15.27).
Glutamine acts at the levels of transcription and posttranslational control. Here we describe only a portion of

cell needs to stop making GlnA and inactivate whatever
still remains. To halt glnA transcription, GlnB dephosphorylates NtrB-P, and then NtrB dephosphorylates NtrCP (step 5). NtrC cannot bind the enhancer, and thus glnA
transcription stops.
Meanwhile, GlnB also compels GlnE to add an AMP
to GlnA (adenylylation, step 6). This modification inactivates whatever GlnA remains in the cell. The reaction
is amplified by GlnD, which, under high glutamine,
reverses its reaction, removing UMP from GlnB (step 7).
The result is that ammonium ion no longer condenses
with glutamate, and the glutamate/glutamine ratio is
maintained.

by a complex pathway is arginine (Fig. 15.28). Bacterial
arginine biosynthesis generally involves about a dozen different enzymes distributed among four to eight operons.
Operon expression is regulated by an arginine repressor
that binds the promoter of each operon to prevent transcription in the presence of sufficient arginine for cell
needs. In some species, the arginine repressor also activates

enzymes of arginine catabolism, making the excess amino
acid available as a carbon source.
Arginine biosynthesis. Arginine synthesis begins with the

condensation of glutamate with acetyl-CoA (Fig. 15.28,
step 1), transferring an amino group to the arginine precursor. Three more amino groups (–NH 2) are transferred

CHAPTER 15

subsequently by glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate. A
second glutamate transfers an amino group to the arginine
precursor (step 2), while its own carbon skeleton cycles
back as 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate). This transfer
of NH4+ between two organic intermediates is an example
of transamination. The original acetyl group from acetylCoA is then hydrolyzed, producing ornithine. Ornithine
is a central intermediate, used by cells to synthesize proline and various polyamines, as well as arginine.

Ornithine receives a third amino group (Fig. 15.28,
step 3) from glutamine via conversion of CO2 to carbamoyl

Aromatic amino acids. The complexity of aromatic amino
acids requires particularly energy-expensive biosynthesis. The number of different enzymes required, however,
is minimized by the presence of a common core pathway
branching to several different amino acids (Fig. 15.29).
The three aromatic amino acids—phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan—each require a common precursor,
chorismate. The pathway to chorismate starts with simple
glycolytic intermediates (phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate), but its synthesis requires 10 enzymes
encoded in a single operon, aroABCDEFGHKL. From
chorismate to phenylalanine or tyrosine requires three additional enzymatic steps. From chorismate to tryptophan,
the most complex amino acid specified by the genetic code,
requires another five enzymes, expressed by trpABCDE.
Thus, at least 15 enzymes encoded by different genes are
required to make tryptophan out of simple substrates.
Not surprisingly, the presence of tryptophan in the cell
represses expression of its own biosynthetic enzymes. Repression of the trp operon includes two mechanisms: the Trp
repressor, effective over moderate to high levels of tryptophan; and an RNA loop mechanism called attenuation, sensitive to lower levels of tryptophan (discussed in Chapter 10).
Attenuation involves the destabilization of the transcription
complex by formation of a specific stem loop on the nascent
trp mRNA. The mechanism of attenuation in E. coli was discovered in 1981 by Charles Yanofsky, winner of a National
Medal of Science in 2003. Several other

Carbamoyl phosphate provides a way to assimilate one

The fourth nitrogen is acquired from aspartate in a twostep process requiring ATP release of pyrophosphate (PPi)

intermediate, yields arginine.

Purine synthesis. The hydrolysis of PRPP releases
pyrophosphate, thus spending two high-energy
phosphate bonds. This irreversible reaction drives
–
forward the subsequent reactions to make the
COO
purine (Fig. 15.30, left). To construct the purine,
the pyrophosphate at carbon 1 (C-1) is replaced by
an amine from glutamine. The purine is built up by
addition of a series of single-carbon groups (formyl,
methyl, and CO2) alternating with nitrogens from
glutamine and carbamoyl phosphate. The number
of single-carbon assimilations, including assimilaCO2
tion of CO2, is striking. It may reflect the ancient
origin of the purine synthetic pathway, which
evolved in CO2-fi xing autotrophs.

Biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines.

Both purines and pyrimidines are built onto ribose 5-phosphate.
Ribose 5-phosphate is directed into purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis by the activating step of ATP → AMP, converting the sugar to
5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). The purine ring is built
up out of successive additions of amines, one-carbon units, plus a
formyl group from formyltetrahydrofolate (formyl-THF). The purine
ring is modified to yield AMP and GMP. Likewise, the pyrimidine ring
is modified to yield CMP or TMP.

Pyrimidine synthesis. The pyrimidine is built by a slightly

different route (Fig. 15.30, right). First, the six-membered pyrimidine ring forms from aspartate plus carbamoyl
phosphate. The pyrimidine ring then displaces the pyrophosphate of PRPP, attaching by a nitrogen to the ribosyl carbon 1. The fi rst pyrimidine built is uracil (as UMP),
which can be converted to cytosine or thymine—as cytidine monophosphate (CMP) or thymidine monophosphate
(TMP), respectively.

Nonribosomal Peptide Antibiotics

In addition to the standard amino acids used by ribosomes, there exist hundreds of different amino acids used
by cells for functions such as the cross-bridges of peptidoglycan (discussed in Chapter 3). Some of these are made
by one-step modification of standard amino acids, such as
epimerization (altering the chirality from L to D) or halogenation with chlorine or fluorine. Others have complex
carbon skeletons, including unsaturated bonds and threemembered rings. Both standard and nonstandard amino
acids are used by actinomycetes to build secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity. These secondary metabolites are called nonribosomal peptide antibiotics because
their peptide backbone is constructed by an enzyme without ribosomes. Nonribosomal peptide antibiotics are synthesized by modular “assembly-line” enzymes, analogous
to those that build polyketides. An example is vancomycin,
the main antibiotic used against the lethal hospital-borne
pathogen Clostridium difficile. Vancomycin biosynthesis is
presented in eTopic 15.4.
Amino acids also serve as precursors to form larger
structures such as vitamins. For example, bacteria may
assemble eight molecules of glutamic acid into a giant
ring structure called a tetrapyrrole. Tetrapyrrole derivatives include essential cofactors of energy transduction
and biosynthesis, such as chlorophylls, hemes of cytochromes and hemoglobin, and vitamin B12. Tetrapyrrole
biosynthesis and its control by riboswitches are described
in eTopics 15.5 and 15.6.

■

Arginine biosynthesis requires multiple steps of NH3
transfer and carbon skeleton condensation.
Aromatic amino acids are built from a common pathway that branches out. Their biosynthesis is regulated
tightly at both transcriptional and translational levels.
Purines are built as nucleotides attached to a ribose
phosphate. Several single-carbon groups are assimilated,
including CO2 —a phenomenon suggesting an ancient
pathway. Pyrimidines are made from aspartate, and then
added onto PRPP.
Nonribosomal peptide antibiotics are built by modular
enzymes analogous to those that build polyketides.

Concluding Thoughts
In living cells, no enzymatic pathway occurs in isolation.
All pathways of energy acquisition and biosynthesis occur
together, sharing common substrates and products. For
example, acetyl-CoA is produced by glycolysis or by fatty
acid degradation; it is then utilized by pathways that synthesize fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleobases. Other
precursors to these molecules arise from the TCA cycle.
At the same time, cells need the TCA cycle to yield energy
through catabolism. The microbial cell regulates these competing needs on an extremely rapid timescale: Within seconds of the disappearance or appearance of a nutrient, such
as an amino acid, its biosynthesis is turned on or shut off.
A given microbe needs to build as much biomass as it
can by the most efficient means available. For a pathogen
growing within a host, this means using preformed host
compounds for rapid growth and replication. Free-living
microbes, however, face intense competition for organic
nutrients; so, in addition, they need to fix essential elements into readily accessible forms. Marine microbes build
complex biological molecules out of single-carbon and single-nitrogen sources, but they also obtain molecules such
as vitamins from their community. In the soil, actinomycetes build antibiotics to eliminate competitors and extract
their nutrients. Those antibiotics offer powerful tools for
human medicine.
Microbial metabolism has many applications in food
preparation and preservation, and in industrial production of pharmaceuticals. Food and industrial microbiology are discussed in Chapter 16. Later, in Chapters 21
and 22, we will see how microbial metabolism contributes
to communities of organisms, and ultimately to Earth’s
global cycles.

harvest, microbes on the food’s surface or from the air
colonize the food. Their growth can render food rancid or putrid. The need for food preservation has led to
drying, salting, smoking, and adding spices, all of which
retard microbial growth. The principles of food microbiology extend to a growing field of industrial microbiology. Industrial microbiology includes the development
of microbial antibiotics and enzymes. Giant fermentors

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

The industrial enzyme lipase B (see the Current Research
Highlight) is just one of many lucrative commercial products of the microbial fermentation industry, a term for
the culturing of microbes to make products for market.
Today, bioprospecting reveals microbial sources for products in remote locations around the world, particularly
those of extreme and unusual environments. Lipase B, with
its wide temperature range, was isolated from Lake Vanda,
a hypersaline Antarctic lake covered by 3 meters of ice. Yet
the deep water of the lake maintains temperature as high
as 25°C, sustained in part by solar heating. Thus, microbes
from this lake experience a wide range of temperatures; and
their enzymes may show activity over a wide temperature
range, which is useful for industrial processes.
While today’s industry involves sophisticated biotechnology, the roots of the fermentation industry reach back to
5000 BCE, the date of pottery jars excavated from a Neolithic mud-brick kitchen in the Zagros Mountains of modern
Iran (Fig. 16.1A). The jars contain residue showing chemical traces of grapes fermented to wine. Besides making wine,
Neolithic people leavened bread, another staple food requiring microbial growth. For thousands of years, microbial fermentation has been a daily part of human life and commerce.
Today, microbial products are made by bacteria grown in
giant fermentation vessels (Fig. 16.1B) (discussed in Section 16.6). Industrial “fermentation” generally uses respiratory metabolism to maximize microbial growth. Microbial
growth drives companies such as DuPont Industrial Biosciences, now earning hundreds of millions of dollars in
annual revenues from engineering microbial enzymes for

industry originated from long-standing microbial associations with human food. Until the relatively recent invention of steam-pressure sterilization, all foods contained live
microbes. Microbial metabolism could spoil food—or it
could improve the food by adding flavor, preserving valuable nutrients, and preventing growth of pathogens. As we
learned in Chapter 1, one of the first great microbiologists,
Louis Pasteur, began his career as a chemist investigating
fermentation in winemaking. In Chapter 16 we see how the
many kinds of microbial biochemistry presented in Chapters 13–15 give rise to the characteristics of food so familiar
to us—from the taste of cheese and chocolate to the rising of bread dough and the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages. Industrial research continues to improve
food through food biochemistry, discovering the molecular basis for the flavor and texture of microbial foods; food
preservation, eliminating undesirable microbial decay by
preservative methods; and food engineering, improving the
quality, shelf life, and taste of microbial foods.

Microbes as Food

Certain kinds of microbial bodies have long been eaten as
food, especially the fruiting bodies of fungi and the fronds
of marine algae. Single-celled algae and cyanobacteria are
also used as food supplements. These microbes can provide
important sources of protein, vitamins, and minerals.

Edible Fungi

In the children’s classic Homer
Price, by Robert McCloskey, settlers
on the Ohio frontier save themselves
from starvation when they discover
“forty-two pounds of edible fungus, in the wilderness a-growin’.”
Fungal fruiting bodies, multicellular reproductive structures that generate spores, are commonly known
as mushrooms (see Chapter 20).
Mushrooms offer a flavorful source
of protein and minerals. The protein
content of edible mushrooms can be
as high as 25% dry weight, comparable to that of whole milk (percent
dry weight), and includes all essential dietary amino acids.
Mushrooms contributed to the
survival of preindustrial humans,

fronds cultured for nori (Fig. 16.3). Nori is best known
for its use in wrapping rice, fish, and vegetables to form
sushi. Another edible alga, kelp, is the source of alginate,
an important food additive (see Section 16.6).
For nori production, the red algae are grown as “seeds,”
or starter cultures, in enclosed tanks. The starter cultures
are then distributed on nets in a protected coastal area, usually an estuary. The cultures grow until they hang heavy
from the nets, when they are harvested for processing into

in painful conditions such as gout and kidney stones. For
this reason, most bacteria can be consumed only as a minor
component of food mass, as in fermented foods.
An exception is the cyanobacterium Spirulina, whose
purine content is low enough to include as a modest part
of the human diet (Fig. 16.4A). Spirulina consists of spiral-shaped cells that grow photosynthetically in freshwater.
Spirulina is sold as a food additive rich in protein, vitamin B12, and minerals. It also contains antioxidant substances that may prevent cancer. Spirulina is grown with
illumination in special ponds lined for food production.
The final product is collected and vacuum-dried to form a
dark green powder of flour-like consistency.
In the food industry, Spirulina is classified as a form of
single-celled protein, a term for edible microbes of high
food value. Other kinds of single-celled proteins include
eukaryotes such as yeast and algae. The twentieth century
saw the development of single-celled protein as a food source
for impoverished populations. The yeast Saccharomyces

Fermented Foods:
An Overview

Virtually all human cultures have developed varieties of
fermented foods, food products that are modified biochemically by microbial growth. The purposes of food fermentation include the following:
■

To preserve food. Certain microbes, particularly the
lactobacilli, metabolize only a narrow range of nutrients
before their waste products build up and inhibit further
growth. Typically, the waste fermentation products that
limit growth are carboxylic acids, ammonia (alkaline), or
alcohol. Buildup of these substances renders the product
stable for much longer than the original food substrate.

■

To improve digestibility. Microbial action breaks down
fibrous macromolecules and tenderizes the product,
making it easier for humans to digest. Meat and vegetable products are tenderized by fermentation.

■

To add nutrients and flavors. Microbial metabolism
generates vitamins, particularly vitamin B12, as well as
flavor molecules such as esters and sulfur compounds.

Different societies have devised thousands of different
kinds of fermented foods. Examples are given in Table 16.1.

16.3

Acid- and AlkaliFermented Foods

Many food fermentations produce acids or bases. An acid
or base serves as an effective preservative because the pH
change is unlikely to be reversed, and because animal or
plant bodies grown at near-neutral pH are unlikely to support growth of acidophiles or alkaliphiles, which grow at
extreme pH conditions.

Acid Fermentation of Dairy Products

The conversion of milk to solid or semisolid fermented
products dates far back in human civilization. The practice of milk fermentation probably arose among herders
who collected the milk of their pack animals but had no
way to prevent the rapid growth of bacteria. The milk had
to be stored in a portable container such as the stomach
of a slaughtered animal. After hours of travel, the combined action of lactic acid–producing bacteria and stomach enzymes caused the coagulation of milk proteins into
curd. The curd naturally separated from the liquid portion, called whey. Both curds and whey can be eaten, as in
the nursery rhyme “Little Miss Muffet.” The curds, however, are particularly valuable for their concentrated protein content.
Curd formation. A cheese is any milk product from a mam-

mal (usually cow, sheep, or goat) in which the milk protein coagulates to form a semisolid curd. Curd formation
results from two kinds of processes: acidification, usually
as a result of the microbial production of lactic acid; and
treatment by proteolytic enzymes such as rennet. The curd
may then be separated and processed to varying degrees,
depending on the type of cheese.
How does milk coagulate? The major organic components of cow’s milk are butterfat (about 4% unless
skimmed), protein (3.3%), and the sugar lactose (4.7%).
Milk starts out at about pH 6.6, very slightly acidic. At
this pH, the milk proteins are completely soluble in water;
otherwise they would clog the animal’s udder as the milk
came out. Fermentation generally begins with bacteria

FIGURE 16.6 ■ Bacterial community within Emmentaler
cheese. Bacterial species include Lactobacillus helveticus (rods,
2.0–4.0 µm in length) and Streptococcus thermophilus (cocci).

such as Lactobacillus and Streptococcus (Fig. 16.6). As
bacteria ferment lactose to lactic acid, the pH starts to
decline. The dissociation constant of lactic acid (pK a =
3.9) allows greater deprotonation than with other fermentation products, such as acetate (pK a = 4.8). Thus, lactic
acid rapidly acidifies the milk product to levels that halt
further growth of bacteria. Halting bacterial growth minimizes the oxidation of amino acids, thereby maintaining
food quality.
Milk contains micelles (suspended droplets) of hydrophobic proteins called caseins. As the pH of milk declines
below pH 5, the acidic amino acid residues of caseins
become protonated, eventually destabilizing the tertiary
structure. As the casein molecules unfold (or “denature”),
they expose hydrophobic residues that regain stability by
interacting with other hydrophobic molecules. The intermolecular interaction of caseins generates a gel-like network throughout the milk, trapping other substances, such
as droplets of butterfat. This protein network generates the
semisolid texture of yogurt, a simple product of milk acidified by lactic acid bacteria.
In most kinds of cheese formation, an additional step
of casein coagulation is accomplished by proteases such
as rennet. Rennet derives from the fourth stomach of a
calf, although modern versions are made by genetically
engineered bacteria. Calf rennet includes two proteolytic
enzymes: chymosin and pepsin. Chymosin specifically
cleaves casein into two parts, one of which is charged and
water-soluble, the other hydrophobic. The hydrophobic
portion forms a firmer curd than intact casein and results in
the harder texture of solid cheeses. The water-soluble portion, about one-third of the total casein, enters the whey
and is lost from the curd. Processing of some cheese varieties includes exposure to high temperature, which denatures even the whey protein, so it is retained in the curd.

Varieties of cheese. An extraordinary number of cheese

varieties have been devised (Fig. 16.7). These fall into several categories based on particular steps in their production.

■

■

■

■

■

Soft, unripened cheeses, such as cottage cheese and
ricotta, are coagulated by bacterial action, without rennet. The curd is cooked slightly, and the whey is partly
drained, but their water content is 55% or greater. These
cheeses spoil easily; there are no steps of aging, or
ripening.
Semihard, ripened cheeses, such as Muenster and
Roquefort, include rennet for firmer coagulation, and
the curd is cooked down to a water content of 45%–55%.
The cheese is aged for several months.
Hard cheeses, such as Swiss cheese and cheddar, are
concentrated to even lower water content. Extra-hard
varieties, such as Parmesan and Romano, have a water
content as low as 20%. These cheeses are aged for many
months, even several years.

Brined cheeses, such as feta, are permeated with brine

and develops flavor. Harder cheeses, such as Gouda, may
be brined at the surface.

Cutting of curd

Mold-ripened cheeses are inoculated with mold spores
that germinate and grow during the ripening, or aging,
process to contribute texture and flavor. The mold may
be inoculated on the surface, to form a crust (as in Brie
and Camembert), or it may be spiked deep into the
cheese (as in blue cheese or Roquefort).

these steps, choices of treatment lead to very different varieties. Key steps are illustrated for the example of Gouda
cheese in Figure 16.9.

The pressed curd is then shaped into a mold (Fig. 16.9C),
which determines the ultimate shape of the cheese. Before
ripening (or aging), the cheese may be floated in brine to
generate a rind (Fig. 16.9D); or it may be coated or spiked
with a Penicillium mold. The ripening period then allows
flavor to develop. Texture also changes; for example, where
fermentation has produced CO2, the trapped gas forms
“eyes,” or holes.

Thought Questions

16.3 In an outbreak of listeriosis from unpasteurized cheese,
only the refrigerated cheeses were found to cause disease.
Why would this be the case?
16.4 Cow’s milk contains 4% lipid (butterfat). What happens
to the lipid during cheese production?

FIGURE 16.9 ■ Cheese production. Gouda cheese is produced
at the Henri Willig factory in the Netherlands. A. Milk is poured into a
fermentation tub with a bacterial starter culture and rennet. B. The
milk curd is cut, or “cheddared.” C. The curds are shaped into round
molds and then pressed to remove whey. D. The solidified curds are
floated in brine to form the characteristic rind of Gouda cheese. The
cheese then dries and ripens on the shelf.

modern production includes flash pasteurization (brief
heating to 72°C) (discussed in Chapter 5), although some
traditional cheeses continue to be made from unpasteurized milk. Unpasteurized milk in cheese has been linked
to illness, particularly from Listeria, bacteria that grow at
typical refrigeration temperatures.
The fermenting microbes are added as a starter culture
(Fig. 16.9A). The starter was traditionally derived from
a sample of previous fermentation, in which case the flora
were undefined. Commercial cheese production now uses
defined species. In all but the soft cheeses, bacterial coagulation and curd formation are supplemented by rennet or by
genetically engineered proteases.
The solid curd is then cut, or cheddared (hence the
name “cheddar” cheese) (Fig. 16.9B). The finer the pieces,
the more whey that can be pressed out and the harder the
cheese produced. Curd is then heat treated, with or without the whey; if whey is included, more protein is retained.
Brining at this stage leads to a salty cheese, such as feta.

HENRI WILLIG CHEESE, NETHERLANDS

Flavor generation in cheese. In all fermented foods,

microbial metabolism generates by-products that confer
a characteristic aroma and flavor. In some cases, particular species confer distinctive flavors; for example, Propionibacterium ferments lactate or pyruvate to propionate, a
flavor component of Swiss cheese. All bacteria generate a
surprising range of side reactions, forming trace products
that confer distinctive flavors. For example, while Lactobacillus converts most of the lactose to lactic acid, a small
fraction of the pyruvate is converted to acetoin, acetaldehyde, or acetic acid, which contributes flavor. Most amino
acids are retained intact, but traces are converted to flavorful alcohols, esters, and sulfur compounds (Fig. 16.10).
For example, methanethiol (CH3SH) contributes to the
desirable flavor of cheddar cheese. Lipids are not significantly metabolized by Lactobacillus, but in mold-ripened
cheeses such as Camembert, Penicillium oxidizes a small
amount of the lipids to flavorful methylketones, alcohols,
and lactones.

Acid Fermentation of Vegetables

Many kinds of vegetable products are based on microbial
fermentation. Commercial products marketed globally
include pickles, soy sauce, and sauerkraut. Other products
provide staple foods for particular nations or regions, such
as Indonesian tempeh and Korean kimchi.
Soy fermentation. Soybeans offer one of the best sources
of vegetable protein and are indispensable for the diet of
millions of people, particularly in Southeast Asia. In North
America, soy products are important for vegetarian consumption and as a milk substitute, as well as for animal feed.
But soybeans also contain substances that decrease their
nutritive value. Phytate, or inositol hexaphosphate, chelates

minerals such as iron, inhibiting their
absorption by the intestine. Lectins are
proteins that bind to cell-surface glycoproteins within the human body. At
high concentration, soybean lectins
may upset digestion and induce autoimmune diseases. Soy protease inhibitors
interfere with digestive enzymes chymotrypsin and trypsin, thus decreasing the amount of protein that can be
obtained from soy-based food.
All of these drawbacks of soybeans are diminished by microbial
fermentation, while the protein content remains comparable to that of the
unfermented bean (40%). A variety of
fermented soy foods have been developed. Most soy fermentation involves
mold growth, supplemented by bacteria that contribute vitamins, including
vitamin B12.
A major fermented soy product
is tempeh, a staple food of Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most-populous
country, as well as of other countries
in Southeast Asia (Fig. 16.11). Tempeh consists of soybeans fermented by
Rhizopus oligosporus, a common bread
mold. Besides decreasing the negative
factors of soy, the mold growth breaks
down proteins into more digestible peptides and amino acids. During World War II, tempeh was fed to
American prisoners of war held by
the Japanese. The tempeh was later

Fermentation of cabbage and other vegetables. Vari-

ous leaf vegetables are fermented by traditional societies,
originally as a means of storage over the winter months.
In Europe and North America, the best-known fermented
products include sauerkraut and pickles. Sauerkraut production involves heterolactic fermentation by Leuconostoc
mesenteroides. In heterolactic fermentation, each fermented sugar molecule yields lactic acid, as well as ethanol and carbon dioxide. The culture is used to inoculate
shredded cabbage, which is layered in alternation with salt.
The salt helps limit the number of species and the extent
of microbial growth. A similar brine-enhanced fermentation process is used to pickle cucumbers, olives, and other
vegetables.
An important food based on brine-fermented cabbage
is Korean kimchi (Fig. 16.12). Kimchi is prepared from
Chinese cabbage, salted and layered with radishes, peppers, onions, and other vegetables. The vegetables are covered with a paste of fish, rice, and chili peppers. Pickled
seafoods such as shrimp or oysters may be included. The
entire mixture is stored in a pot, traditionally buried underground for several months. The main fermentation organism is Leuconostoc mesenteroides, although Streptococcus and
Lactobacillus species participate.

credited with saving the lives of prisoners whose dysentery and malnutrition had impaired their ability to absorb
intact proteins.
Tempeh is commonly produced in home-based factories in Indonesia. The soybeans are soaked in water overnight, allowing initial fermentation by naturally present
lactic acid bacteria; in some cases, a crude “starter” may
be introduced from the water of soybeans soaked previously. This pre-fermentation allows bacterial generation
of vitamins and produces mild acid that promotes growth
of mold. The soaked beans are then hulled, cooked, and
cooled to room temperature for inoculation with R. oligosporus spores or with a previous tempeh culture. The
inoculated beans are wrapped in banana leaves or in perforated plastic bags and then allowed to incubate for 2 days.
The mold grows as a white mycelium that permeates the
beans, joining them into a solid cake. The final product
has a mushroom-like taste and is often served fried or
grilled like a hamburger.
Other soy products undergo acid fermentation by the
mold Aspergillus oryzae. The Japanese condiment miso is
made from ground soy and rice, salted and fermented for
2 months by A. oryzae. Soy sauce is made from jiang, a
Chinese condiment similar to miso in which the rice starter
culture is replaced by wheat. The fermentation generates
glutamic acid, a flavor-enhancing compound known popularly in the form of its salt—monosodium glutamate,
or MSG.

Chocolate from Cocoa
Bean Fermentation

Cocoa and coffee beans both require fermentation within
the juice of the fruit before the beans are dried and processed. Chocolate, the product of the cocoa bean, Theobroma cacao (or “food of the gods”), requires one of the
most complex fermentations of any food. For all the commercialization of chocolate production, totaling 2.5 billion
kilos per annum worldwide, no “starter culture” has yet
been standardized to ferment the cocoa bean. The beans
cannot be exported and fermented later; the fermentation
must occur immediately where the beans are harvested
(Fig. 16.13).
The cocoa beans harvested in Africa or South America are heaped in mounds upon plantain leaves for fermentation by indigenous microorganisms, essentially
the same way cocoa has been processed for thousands
of years (Fig. 16.14). The microbial fermentation actually takes place outside the cocoa bean, within the pulp
that clings to the beans after they are removed from the
cocoa fruit. The pulp contains approximately 15% sugars
and pectin (a branched polysaccharide), 2% citric acid,
plus a rich supply of amino acids and minerals. These
nutrients support growth of many kinds of microbes.
Brazilian microbiologist Rosane Schwan (Fig. 16.13A),
of the University of Lavras, Brazil, analyzed the microbial community. She defined three stages of succession: yeasts, lactic acid bacteria, and acetic acid bacteria
(Fig. 16.14B).

pulp (pH 3.6). The acidity favors growth
of yeasts, including Candida, Kloeckera,
and Saccharomyces. The yeasts consume
sugars and citric acid, increasing pH. They
also degrade pectin into glucose and fructose, allowing the pulp to liquefy. As the
liquefied pulp drains, yeast ferments the
remaining sugars to ethanol, CO2, and
mixed acids such as acetate. The reactions release heat, increasing the temperature and accelerating metabolism. But
the acetate, a permeant acid (discussed in
Chapter 13), crosses the yeast cell membrane, where it lowers cell pH and inhibits
growth. The ethanol and acetate also penetrate the bean embryo, killing the cells
and releasing enzymes that generate key
flavor molecules of chocolate.

A.

Lactic acid bacteria (anaerobic). The consumption of citric acid by yeast increases the bean pH to pH 4.2, encouraging growth of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus
plantarum. Lactobacillus species convert sugars to lactic
acid, as well as acetate and CO2. As fermentable substrates
disappear, however, lactic acid bacteria are inhibited.
Acetic acid bacteria (aerobic). After 2 days, the beans are
turned over and mixed periodically to permit access to oxygen. Aerobic acetic acid bacteria such as Acetobacter now
oxidize the ethanol and acids to CO2. The consumption
of acids neutralizes undesirable acidity. Heat is released,

penetrates the bean, oxidizing key components such as
polyphenols. Polyphenol oxidation generates the brown
color of cocoa and contributes flavor.
After fermentation and pulp drainage, the beans are
dried and roasted. The roasting process completes the
transformation of cocoa substances that contribute flavor. Cocoa liquor and cocoa butter are extracted from the
beans and then recombined with sugar and other components to make “cocoa mass” (Fig. 16.15). The cocoa
mass is stirred for several days to achieve a smooth texture; then it is molded into the decorative forms known

process, no flavor would develop. Schwan and other
researchers are working to develop a defined starter culture, a community of microbes to produce a predictable
high quality of flavor. At present, however, one of the
world’s most refined and highly prized commercial food
products still depends on the indigenous microbial fermentation of cocoa pulp.

Alkaline Fermentation: Natto and Pidan

In Western countries, food-associated fermentation is
almost synonymous with acidification. In Southeast
Asia and in Africa, however, many food products involve
increased pH. Such fermentations typically release small
amounts of ammonia, which raises the pH to about pH 8,
retarding growth of all but alkali-toler- A.
ant bacteria. The fermenting bacteria are
usually Bacillus, aerobic species tolerant
of moderate alkali and capable of extensive proteolysis and amino acid decomposition. The fermentation needs to be
controlled to limit the loss of protein
content, but the end result is a highly stable food product.

B. natto secretes numerous extracellular enzymes,
including proteases, amylases, and phytases. These
enzymes decrease the undesirable components of soy,
such as phytates and lectins, while liberating more easily
digestible peptides and amino acids. Some of the amino
acids are deaminated, generating ammonia; a well-ventilated natto chamber allows most of this gas to escape. In
addition, B. natto synthesizes extracellular polymers such
as polyglutamate (a peptide chain consisting exclusively of
glutamic acid residues). Polyglutamate generates long elastic strings that bind the beans together. The stretching of
these strings from chopsticks is considered a sign of a good
natto (Fig. 16.16A).
Alkali-fermented vegetables. In Africa, numerous vegetable products are based on alkaline fermentation predominantly by Bacillus species. An example is dawadawa,
a paste of fermented locust beans common in western
Africa. The locust beans are washed and supplemented
with potash (potassium hydroxide) originally obtained
from wood ashes. This addition of alkali retards growth of
bacteria other than Bacillus species, which predominate at
higher pH. The beans are fermented by indigenous bacteria (bacteria already present in the beans). The fermented
beans are sun-dried, releasing most of the ammonia, and
pounded into cakes for storage. Similar alkali-fermented
vegetables include ogiri, from melon seeds, and ugba, from
oil beans.

famous Chinese delicacy pidan, or “century egg,” now a

lime and sodium carbonate react to form NaOH, which
penetrates the eggshells, raising pH and coagulating the
egg white proteins. The eggs are buried in mud for several
months, during which time the combined action of alkali
and Bacillus fermentation generates dark colors and interesting flavors.

Some of our most nutritionally significant and culturally important foods, including most bread and alcoholic
beverages, require ethanolic fermentation by yeast fungi.
Ethanolic fermentation converts pyruvic acid to ethanol

Milk curd forms by lactic acid fermentation and rennet proteolysis, rendering casein insoluble. The cleaved
peptides coagulate to form a semisolid curd. The main
fermentative organisms are lactic acid bacteria.
Cheese varieties include unripened cheeses, semihard
and hard cheeses that are cooked down and ripened,
brined cheeses, and mold-ripened cheeses.
Cheese flavors are generated by minor side products
of fermentation, such as alcohols, esters, and sulfur
compounds.
Soy fermentation to tempeh and other products
improves digestibility and decreases undesirable soy
components such as phytates and lectins. The fermentative agent of tempeh is the bread mold Rhizopus
oligosporus.

The most prominent yeast used is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, known as baker’s yeast or brewer’s yeast (Fig. 16.17).
A hardy organism, S. cerevisiae easily survives on a grocery
shelf for home use and is genetically tractable for fundamental research. The yeast has been studied since the time
of Pasteur, who used it to prove the biological basis of fermentation (presented in Chapter 1). S. cerevisiae today is a
major model system of cell biology, yielding the molecular
secrets of human cancer and other diseases.
Bread making depends on carbon dioxide to generate air
spaces that leaven the dough, making its substance easier
to chew and digest. The small amount of ethanol produced
is eliminated during baking. For alcoholic beverages, however, ethanol is the key product, accompanied by carbon
dioxide bubbles for “fizz,” known as carbonation.

Modern bread sold commercially is produced on an
industrial scale. The dough is made in huge vats and then
cut into regular chunks that are placed into the bread pans.
The loaves are baked under hot-air convection, a method
that greatly decreases the baking time. In the United
States, most commercial bread is sliced mechanically—an
invention that dates back to 1912. Sliced bread, however,
has a shorter shelf life unless preservative chemicals prevent

Yeast bread production. The preparation of all forms of
yeast bread requires the same fundamental steps. A starter
culture of yeast is included in the dough. The yeast can be
commercial baker’s yeast, or it can be sourdough starter,
an undefi ned microbial population derived from a previous
batch of dough. Analysis of sourdough shows mainly yeasts
and lactobacilli, which release acids that favor the growth
of the yeasts. The dough is kneaded to develop a fi ne network of air pockets and allowed to rise, expanding with
production of the carbon dioxide gas (Fig. 16.19). The

contains gluten, a protein complex that forms a fi ne molecular network supporting the rising dough.

The high microbial content provides a substantial source of

Injera is made from teff (Eragrostis tef ), a grain with
small, round kernels that have high protein and lack gluten. Teff grows in arid regions and is now being cultivated
in the United States for gluten-free products. Because teff
lacks gluten, it cannot rise as much as wheat flour, but
it makes a kind of flatbread. The dough is spread into a
wide pancake, and the organisms present in the grain and
air are allowed to ferment it for 3 days. The fermentation includes a succession of species, usually dominated
by the yeast Candida. The extended fermentation generates a complex range of by-products that confer exceptional flavors in the baked product. In Ethiopia, injera
forms the basis of an entire meal, served with other food
items placed upon it as an edible tablecloth. Diners wrap
samples of each food in a fold of injera and consume them
together.

Alcoholic Beverages: Beer and Wine

Ethanolic fermentation of grain or fruit was important to
early civilizations because it provided a drink free of waterborne pathogens. Traditional forms of beer also provided
essential vitamins in the unfiltered yeasts.
Ethanol is unique among fermentation products in that
it provides a significant source of caloric intake, but it is
also a toxin that impairs mental function. A modest level of
ethanol enters the human circulation naturally from intestinal flora, equivalent to a fraction of a drink per day. The
human liver produces the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase,
which detoxifies ethanol. This enzyme in a healthy liver
can metabolize small amounts of alcohol without harm.

and modern. A. Making beer in ancient Egypt,

duction is one of the most
ancient fermentation practices and is depicted in the
statuary of ancient Egyptian
tombs dated to 5,000 years
ago (Fig. 16.21A). The earliest Sumerian beers were
made from bread soaked in
water and fermented. Today,
most beer is produced commercially
by
fermenting
barley using giant vats (Fig. 16.21B). Production of
high-quality beer involves complex processing with many
steps, including germination of barley grains, mashing in
water and cooking, and introduction of hops for flavor
(eTopic 16.1).
First the barley grains must germinate; that is, the seed
embryos must start to grow. The germinating embryo
makes enzymes needed to break down the barley starch to
maltose (disaccharide) and glucose. Most of the sugars are
fermented by yeast to ethanol and carbon dioxide. However, minor side products contribute flavors—or unpleasant
off-flavors if present in too great an amount (Fig. 16.22).
For example, off-flavors may result from the presence of
small amounts of oxygen that oxidize some ethanol to
acetaldehyde.
The yeast ferment most sugars to ethanol, but a small
fraction is drawn off to make amino acids via TCA cycle
intermediates, as discussed in Chapter 15. The 2-oxo
acids of the TCA cycle are analogous to pyruvate, with
the methyl group replaced by extended carbon chains
(R group). A tiny amount of the 2-oxo acids is converted
to long-chain alcohols, which add desirable f lavor to
beer.

produce the best-known wines, but wines and distilled
liquors are also made from apples, plums, and other fruits.
The key difference between fermentation of fruits and fermentation of grains is the exceptionally high monosaccharide content in fruits. Grape juice, for example, can contain
concentrations of glucose and fructose as high as 15%. The
availability of simple sugars allows yeast to begin fermenting immediately, with no need for preliminary breakdown
of long-chain carbohydrates, as in the malting and mashing of beer.
Most modern wine production uses strains of the
grape Vitis vinifera. The grapes are crushed to release
juices, usually in the presence of antioxidants such as
sulfur dioxide (Fig. 16.23). For white wine, the skins
are removed before juice is fermented. For red wine, the
skins are included in early fermentation to extract the
red and purple anthocyanin pigments, as well as phenolic
f lavor compounds. The first few days of fermentation are
dominated by indigenous species of yeast naturally present on the grapes, such as Kloeckera and Hanseniaspora
species. Commercial producers usually inoculate with
standard Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose population

The wine is seeded with Oenococcus oeni bacteria, which
ferment L-malate (deprotonated L-malic acid).
As in beer production, yeast fermentation of wine produces numerous minor products contributing flavor, such
as long-chain alcohols and esters. At the same time, overgrowth of yeast or the growth of undesired species can
produce excess amounts of these compounds, such as sulfides and phenolics, giving rise to off-flavors. Some undesired species require oxygen exposure, whereas others can
grow during storage and bottling. The balance of microbial populations is challenging to control and has a major
role in determining the quality of a given wine vintage.

Food Spoilage and
Preservation

We humans have always competed with microbes for our
food. When early humans killed an animal, microbes commenced immediately to consume its flesh. Because meat
perished so fast, it made economic sense to share the kill
immediately and consume it all as soon as possible. Vegetables might last longer, but eventually they succumbed to
mold and rot. Later societies developed preservation methods, such as drying, smoking, and canning, that enabled
humans to survive winters and dry seasons on stored food.
Modern food preservation depends on antimicrobial
agents (chemical substances that either kill microbes or
slow their growth), as well as physical preservative measures, such as treatment with heat and pressure. These
general principles of microbial control are described in
Chapter 5. Here we focus on microbial contamination and
food preservation from the perspective of the food industry.

Food Spoilage and Food Contamination

After food is harvested, several kinds of chemical changes
occur. Some begin instantly, whereas others take several
days to develop. Some changes, such as meat tenderizing,
may be considered desirable; others, such as putrefaction,
render food unfit for consumption. The major classes of
food change include:
■

Enzymatic processes. Following the death of an animal, its flesh undergoes proteolysis by its own enzymes.
Limited proteolysis tenderizes meat. Plants after harvest
undergo other changes; for example, in harvested corn
the sugar rapidly converts to starch. That is why vegetables taste sweetest immediately after harvest.

■

Chemical reactions with the environment. The most
common abiotic chemical reactions involve oxidation
by air—for example, lipid autooxidation, which generates rancid odors. Much research addresses oxidation, and the development of technologies to prevent it
(Fig. 16.24). For example, produce may be packaged
under an anaerobic atmosphere, in a film that prevents
oxygen transmission.

■

Microbiological processes. Microbes from the surface
of the food begin to consume it—some immediately,

For red wine, the grapes are fermented with the skins at a temperature that increases extraction of color and tannins. Right: For white
wine, the skins are removed before addition of yeast starter, and
the temperature is kept low to retain volatile flavors. Both kinds of
wine usually undergo malolactic fermentation by Oenococcus oeni,
special lactic acid bacteria that consume malic acid.

others later in succession—generating a wide range of
chemical products. In meat, internal organs of the digestive tract are an important source of microbial decay.
Microbial activity can aid food production, but it can
also have various undesirable effects. Two different classes
of microbial effects are distinguished: food spoilage and
food contamination with pathogens.
Food spoilage refers to microbial changes that render
a product obviously unfit or unpalatable for consumption.
For example, rancid milk or putrefied meats are unpalatable and contain metabolic products that may be deleterious to human health, such as oxidized fatty acids or
organic amines. Even in these cases, however, the definition of spoilage depends partly on cultural practice. What
is sour milk to one person may be buttermilk to another;
what one society considers spoiled meat, another may consider merely aged.
Different pathways of microbial metabolism lead to different kinds of spoilage. Sour flavors result from acid fermentation products, as in sour milk. Alkaline products generate
bitter flavor. Oxidation, particularly of fats, causes rancidity, whereas general decomposition of proteins and amino
acids leads to putrefaction. The particularly noxious odors
of putrefaction derive from amino acid breakdown products
that often have apt names, such as the amines cadaverine
and putrescine and the aromatic product skatole.

■

FOOD AND INDUSTRIAL MICROBIOLOGY

623

“Food contamination,” or food poisoning, refers to
the presence of microbial pathogens that cause human disease—for example, rotaviruses that cause gastrointestinal
illness. Other pathogens, such as Clostridium botulinum,
produce toxins with deadly effects (discussed in Chapter 25). Pathogens usually go unnoticed as food is consumed, because their numbers are very low, and they may
not even grow in the food. Even the freshest-appearing
food may cause serious illness if it has been contaminated
with a small number of pathogens.
Since our intestines are full of beneficial bacteria, what
makes a pathogen? Enteric pathogens are often closely
related to members of our gut microbiome, which normally outcompete invaders (discussed in Chapters 21
and 23). Nevertheless, a pathogen may overcome our
defenses, either by use of its virulence factors (see Chapter 25) or by taking advantage of host weakness due to
immunosuppression or to antibiotics depleting the normal microbiome.

How Food Spoils

Different foods spoil in different ways, depending on their
nutrient content, the microbial species, and environmental
factors such as temperature. Table 16.2 summarizes common forms of spoilage.
Dairy products. Milk and other dairy products contain

carbon sources, such as lactose, protein, and fat. In fresh
milk, the nutrient most available for microbial catabolism is
lactose, which commonly supports anaerobic fermentation
to sour milk. Fermentation by the right mix of microbes,
however, leads to yogurt and cheese production, as previously described.
Under certain conditions, bitter off-flavors may be produced by bacterial degradation of proteins. The release of
amines causes a rise in pH. Protein degradation is most
commonly caused by psychrophiles, species that grow well
at cold temperatures, such as those of refrigeration.
Cheeses are less susceptible than milk to general spoilage, because of their solid structure and lowered water
activity. However, cheeses can grow mold on their surface.
Historically, the surface growth of Penicillium strains led
to the invention of new kinds of cheeses. But other kinds
of mold, such as Aspergillus, produce toxins and undesirable flavors.
Meat and poultry. Meat in the slaughterhouse is easily con-

taminated with bacteria from hide, hooves, and intestinal
contents. Muscle tissue offers high water content, which
supports microbial growth, as well as rich nutrients, including glycogen, peptides, and amino acids. The breakdown
of peptides and amino acids produces the undesirable

odorants that defi ne spoilage (for example, cadaverine and
putrescine).
Meat also contains fat, or adipose tissue, but the lipids are largely unavailable to microbial action because they
consist of insoluble fat (triacylglycerides). Instead, meat
lipids commonly spoil abiotically by autooxidation (reaction with oxygen) of unsaturated fatty acids, independent
of microbial activity. Thus, when meats are exposed to air
during storage, they turn rancid—particularly meats such
as pork, which contains highly unsaturated lipids. Autooxidation can be prevented by anaerobic storage, such as
vacuum packing, which also prevents growth of aerobic
microorganisms. The absence of the suppressed organisms,

however, favors growth of lactic acid bacteria and facultative
anaerobes such as Brochothrix thermosphacta. These organisms generate short-chain fatty acids, which taste sour.
In industrialized societies, the most significant factor
determining microbial populations in meat spoilage is the
practice of refrigeration. Refrigeration prolongs the shelf
life of meat because contaminating microbes are predominantly mesophilic (grow at moderate temperatures, as discussed in Chapter 5). But ultimately, the few psychrotrophs
initially present do grow; typically, these are Pseudomonas
species. The pseudomonads are also favored by the low pH
of meat (pH 5.5–7.0), which results from the accumulation
of lactic acid in the muscle.

CHAPTER 16
Seafood. Fish and other seafood contain substantial

amounts of protein and lipids, as well as amines such as
trimethylamine oxide. Fish spoils more rapidly than meat
and poultry for several reasons. First, fish do not thermoregulate, and they inhabit relatively low-temperature
environments. Because fi sh grow in low-temperature environments, their surface microorganisms tend to be psychrotrophic and thus grow well under refrigeration. In
addition, marine fi sh contain high levels of the osmoprotectant trimethylamine oxide, which bacteria reduce
to trimethylamine, a volatile amine that gives seafood its
“fi shy” smell. Finally, the rapid microbial breakdown of
proteins and amino acids leads to foul-smelling amines and
sulfur compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and dimethyl
sulfide.

Thought Question

16.8 Why would bacteria convert trimethylamine oxide

(TMAO) to trimethylamine? Would this kind of spoilage be
prevented by exclusion of oxygen?

Plant foods. Fruits, vegetables, and grains spoil differently

from animal foods because of their high carbohydrate content and their relatively low water content. The low water
content of plant foods usually translates into considerably
longer shelf life than for animal-based foods. Carbohydrates favor microbial fermentation to acids or alcohols that
limit further decomposition, and this microbial action can
be managed to produce fermented foods, as described in
Section 16.2.
Plant pathogens rarely infect humans but may destroy
the plant before harvest. Most plant pathogens are fungi,
although some are bacteria, such as Erwinia species. Historically, plant pathogens have caused major agricultural
catastrophes, such as the Irish potato famine, caused by
a fungus-like pathogen. Plant pathogens continue to devastate local economies and cause shortages worldwide; for
example, the witches’-broom fungus Crinipellis perniciosa
causes a fungal disease of cocoa trees that has drastically
cut Latin American cocoa production.
After harvest, various molds and bacteria can soften
and wilt plant foods by producing enzymes that degrade
the pectins and celluloses that give plants their structure.
In general, the more processed the food, the greater the
opportunities for spoilage. For example, citrus fruits generally last for several weeks, but peeled oranges are susceptible to spoilage by Gram-negative bacteria.
Baked bread usually resists spoilage, except for surface
molds. In rare cases, however, improperly baked bread can
show contamination. The appearance of red bread, caused

by the red bacterium Serratia marcescens, is believed to
have been the source of the “blood” observed in communion bread during a Catholic mass in the Italian town of
Bolsena in 1263—an event that became known as the Miracle of Bolsena.

Pathogens Contaminate Food

Intestinal pathogens spread readily because microbes can
be transmitted through food without any outward sign
that the food is spoiled. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are 76 million cases of gastrointestinal illness a year in this country,
usually spread through water or food. Thus, one in four
Americans experiences gastrointestinal illness in a given
year. In 2013, under President Obama, the Food and Drug
Administration implemented new controls and rules as part
of the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act, the largest
reform of the U.S. food safety laws in 70 years. The new
laws require, for example, that crop irrigation water be free
of pathogens and that agricultural workers have access to
bathroom facilities.
An example of food contamination is the 2008 outbreak of Salmonella enterica from peanut products. Peanuts contaminated at one processing plant led to an
epidemic that sickened 700 people across the United
States (Fig. 16.25A). The first cases of Salmonella infection were reported to the CDC on September 1, 2008.
Most infected individuals developed diarrhea, fever, and
abdominal cramps 12–72 hours after infection, and symptoms lasted 4–7 days. Over the next 6 months, cases were
reported from nearly all U.S. states. The curve of the outbreak (cases rising and then falling) followed the profile of
a single-source epidemic, in which all infections are ultimately traced back to one source. (Epidemics are discussed
in Chapter 28.)
What was the original source of the widespread outbreak? The CDC researchers compared the food intake
histories of ill persons against matched controls. They
found a statistical association between illness and intake of
peanut butter, eventually narrowed to a specific brand of
peanut butter sold to institutions. As the epidemic grew,
cases emerged in which the contaminated food product
was crackers filled with peanut butter cream. Ultimately,
the peanut butter and cream were traced back to peanuts
from a single factory in Georgia. At the food plant, the
source of Salmonella contamination could not be identified, but the plant records showed that product samples
had tested positive for Salmonella. Instead of discarding
the product, the plant had retested the samples until they
“tested negative.” Numerous health violations were cited,
including gaps in the walls and dirt buildup throughout
the plant.

Salmonella bacteria are very common pathogens. Did
all of the cases of illness result from a common strain? The
CDC used DNA analysis to show that all patients carried a common strain of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium.
(A serovar is a strain whose surface proteins elicit a distinctive immune response.) The strain was identified by
analysis of its genomic DNA cleaved by restriction endonucleases (see Section 7.6). Each restriction endonuclease
cleaves DNA at sequence-specific positions. Strains that
differ at key restriction sites generate cleavage fragments
of differing length, which are separated by pulsed-field
electrophoresis (Fig. 16.25B). In electrophoresis, applied
voltage causes DNA fragments to migrate different distances according to size; the pulsed field optimizes separation of the largest sizes. The distance each fragment
moves is visualized as a band in the gel. The band pattern, or “fingerprint,” of Salmonella DNA from infected
patients showed the same fragment lengths as Salmonella
DNA from the peanut butter sample, labeled “(1)” in Figure 16.25B. The band pattern from this peanut butter
sample (1) was different from that of another infected peanut butter sample (2); the bacterium in (2) proved unrelated to the Salmonella outbreak.

This case illustrates several troubling features of food
contamination in modern society. It shows the consequence of a food production plant’s failure to follow regulations, and the failure of health inspection to enforce
them. The contaminated product shipped out to a diverse
array of institutions such as schools and to secondary producers such as cookie manufacturers, who incorporated
the peanut butter cream ingredient. The bacteria then
remained viable in contaminated food products for many
months, sickening people long after the contamination
event occurred.

Food-Borne Pathogens Emerge
from Environment and Agriculture

Our environment and agriculture present constant sources
of potential pathogens. Agricultural microbiologists continually assess the potential contamination of produce. For
example, student Julia DeNiro worked with Douglas Doohan at the Ohio State University to study contamination
of lettuce and tomatoes fertilized by manure (Fig. 16.26).

vesicle fusion in the terminals of peripheral motor neurons
(Fig. 16.30). Synaptic inhibition prevents activation of
muscle cells, causing flaccid paralysis. Microbial toxins are
discussed further in Chapter 25.

Food Preservation

Cultural practices and cuisines have long evolved to limit
food spoilage. Such practices include cooking (heat treatment), addition of spices (chemical preservation), and
fermentation (partial microbial digestion). In modern commercial food production, spoilage and contamination are
prevented by numerous methods based on fundamental
principles of physics and biochemistry that limit microbial
growth (discussed in Chapter 5).

pathogenicity island. A pathogenicity island consists of
a set of genes and operons that function coordinately (as
discussed in Section 9.6). The colocalization of the genes
enables transfer of virulence capability to other species as
pathogens evolve. Figure 16.29 shows an example of a
pathogenicity island in Salmonella. Four of its operons contribute to the type III secretion complex, which secretes
toxins and host colonization factors (discussed in Chapter 25). Other genes encode outer membrane proteins that
counteract host defenses, as well as regulators of virulence
gene expression.
The most dangerous consequence of infection by foodborne pathogens is the production of a potentially fatal
toxin. For example, E. coli O157:H7 infection of the intestines can be overcome, but the bacteria produce Shiga
toxin, which can destroy the kidneys. In cases of adult botulism, Clostridium botulinum does not usually grow within
the patient; the botulinum toxin comes from bacteria that

Physical means of preservation. Specific processes that

preserve food based on temperature, pressure, or other
physical factors include:
■

Dehydration and freeze-drying. Removal of water
prevents microbial growth. Water is removed either
by application of heat or by freezing under vacuum
(known as freeze-drying, or lyophilization). Drying
is especially effective for vegetables and pasta. The disadvantage of drying is that some nutrients are broken
down.

■

Refrigeration and freezing. Refrigeration temperature (typically –2°C to 16°C) slows microbial growth,
as shown in an experiment comparing bacterial growth
in ground beef at different temperatures (Fig. 16.31).
Nevertheless, refrigeration also selects for psychrotrophs, such as Listeria. Freezing halts the growth of
most microbes, but preexisting contaminant strains
often survive to grow again when the food is thawed.
This is why deep-frozen turkeys, for example, can still
cause Salmonella poisoning, especially if the interior is
not fully thawed before roasting.

with decreased oxygen or increased CO2. Controlled
atmospheres limit abiotic oxidation, as well as microbial
growth. For example, CO2 storage is particularly effective for extending the shelf life of apples.

effective for extending the shelf life of liquid foods with
consistent, well-understood microbial flora, such as milk
and fruit juices.
■

Canning. In canning, the most widespread and effective means of long-term food storage, food is cooked
under pressure to attain a temperature high enough
to destroy endospores (typically 121°C). Commercial
canning effectively eliminates microbial contaminants,
except in very rare cases. The main drawback of canning
is that it incurs some loss of food value, particularly that
of labile biochemicals such as vitamins, as well as loss of
desirable food texture and taste.

■

Ionizing radiation. Exposure to ionizing radiation,
known as food irradiation, effectively sterilizes many
kinds of food for long-term storage. The main concerns
about food irradiation are its potential for unknown
effects on food chemistry and the hazards of the irradiation process itself for personnel involved in food processing. Nevertheless, irradiation has proved highly effective
at eliminating pathogens that would otherwise cause
serious illness.

Pasteurization. Invented by Louis Pasteur, pasteurization is a short-term heat treatment designed to decrease
microbial contamination with minimal effect on food
value and texture (discussed in Chapter 5). For example,
milk is commonly pasteurized at 63°C for 30 minutes,
followed by quick cooling to 4°C. Pasteurization is most

Often, two or more means of preservation are used in
combination, such as acid treatment and refrigeration. For
example, Figure 16.32 shows results of a typical experiment measuring the effect of pH on microbial survival in
refrigerated food—in this case, E. coli O157:H7 in Greek
eggplant salad. Note the critical threshold pH required
to decrease bacterial counts. At pH 4.0, about the pH of
lemon juice, the bacteria show a steep exponential death
curve, whereas at pH 4.5 the bacteria remain viable for
many days.

Therefore, the value of 12D (required to decrease a population by 12 logs) is 12D111 = 1,800 minutes. Sterilization
may take longer, but food quality is likely to remain high,
because the sterilizing temperature is lower.

■

Acids. While microbial fermentation can preserve foods
by acidification, an alternative approach is to add acids
directly. Organic acids commonly used to preserve food
include benzoic acid, sorbic acid, and propionic acid.
The acids are generally added as salts: sodium benzoate,
potassium sorbate, sodium propionate. These acids act
by crossing the cell membrane in the protonated form
and then releasing their protons at the higher intracellular pH. For this reason, they work best in foods that
already have moderate acidity (pH 5–6), such as dried
fruits and processed cheeses.

■

Esters. The esters of organic acids often show antimicrobial activity whose basis is poorly understood. Examples include fatty acid esters and parabens (benzoic acid
esters). They are used to preserve processed cheeses and
vegetables.

■

Other organic compounds. Numerous organic compounds, both traditional and synthetic, have antimicrobial properties. For example, cinnamon and cloves
contain the benzene derivative eugenol, a potent antimicrobial agent.

■

Inorganic compounds. Inorganic food preservatives
include salts, such as phosphates, nitrites, and sulfites.
Nitrites and sulfites inhibit aerobic respiration of bacteria, and their effectiveness is enhanced at low pH.
These substances, however, may have harmful effects on
humans; nitrites can be converted to toxic nitrosamines,
and sulfites cause allergic reactions in some people.

How does the food industry know how long to treat
food for sterilization? Several measurements indicate the
efficiency of heat killing. The D-value (decimal reduction
time) was described in Chapter 5. An additional measure is
12D, the amount of time required to kill 1012 spores (or to
decrease a population by 12 log10 units). A third measure is
the z-value, the increase in degrees Celsius needed to lower
the D-value to 1/10 of the time. If, for example, D100 (the
D-value at 100°C) and D110 (the D-value at 110°C) for a
given organism are 20 minutes and 2 minutes, respectively,
then 12D100 equals 240 minutes (that is, 20 minutes × 12),
and the z-value is 10°C (because a 10°C increase in temperature reduced the D-value to 1/10, from 20 minutes
to 2 minutes). These measurements are determined empirically for each organism. The values are extremely important
to the canning industry, which must ensure that canned
goods do not contain spores of Clostridium botulinum,
the anaerobic soil microbe that causes the paralyzing foodborne disease botulism (see Fig. 16.30).
Because the tastes of certain foods suffer if they are overheated, z-values and 12D-values are used to adjust heating times and temperatures to achieve the same sterilizing
result. Take the following example, where D121 is 10 minutes and 12D121 is 120 minutes. Sterilizing at 121°C for
120 minutes might result in food with a repulsive taste,
whereas decreasing the temperature and extending the
heating time might yield a more palatable product. The
D-values and z-values are used to adjust conditions for
sterilization at a lower temperature. If D121 is 15 minutes
(the time needed to kill 90% of cells) and the z-value is
known to be 10°C (the temperature change needed to
change D-value tenfold), then decreasing temperature by
10°C, to 111°C, will mean D111 is 150 minutes (10 × D121).

Thought Question

methods to completely eliminate microbes from food?
Explain.

To Summarize

Food spoilage refers to chemical changes that render
food unfit for consumption. Food spoils through degradation by enzymes within the food, through spontaneous
chemical reactions, and through microbial metabolism.

activities that spread pathogens.

from cloned genes; or proteins from microbes with useful properties, such as thermostability or increased catalytic activity for a chemical process.
■

Isolating a microbe to produce the product. A novel
product, such as an antibiotic, is generally developed
from a naturally occurring microbe. The genes encoding
product biosynthesis may then be cloned into an industrial vector.

■

Scaling up production in quantity. The producer
microbial strain must be grown on an industrial scale,
and the product must be isolated and purified.

■

Developing a business plan. The scientist-entrepreneur
must obtain partners skilled at industrial management,
finance, and marketing. Patents must be filed to protect
intellectual property rights.

■

Safety and efficacy testing. Human consumption,
environmental introduction, or consumer use requires
many levels of testing prior to commercialization, including, in some cases, approval by government agencies.

■

Effective marketing. The benefits of the new product must be communicated effectively to convince
customers of its superiority to current products or
processes.

Dairy products can be soured by excessive fermentation
or made bitter by bacterial proteolysis.
Meat and poultry are putrefied by decarboxylating
bacteria, which produce amines with noxious odors.
Fish and other seafood spoil rapidly because their
unsaturated fatty acids rapidly oxidize; they harbor psychrotrophic bacteria that grow under refrigeration; and
their trimethylamine oxide is reduced by bacteria to the
fishy-smelling trimethylamine.
Vegetables spoil by excess growth of bacteria and molds.
Plant pathogens destroy food crops before harvest.
Food preservation includes physical treatments, such as
freezing and canning, as well as the addition of chemical
preservatives, such as benzoates and nitrites.

16.6

Industrial Microbiology

The production and preservation of food is only one field
of industrial microbiology, the commercial exploitation
of microbes. Industrial microbiology is commonly understood to include a broad range of commercial products
derived from microbes, including vaccines and clinical
devices; industrial solvents and catalytic enzymes; bioinformatic analysis of genomes; and genetically modified plants
and animals using microbial vectors.
Other important fields of industrial microbiology are
wastewater treatment, bioremediation, and environmental
management, covered in Chapters 21 and 22.

Failure at any of the preceding tasks spells doom for
the product. Thus, a prudent business plan includes having multiple alternative products in development. Although
the failure rate of new products is high, all the products we
use had to overcome these risks. How does a bench scientist convert a microbial concept into a profitable product?
Some scientists acquire partners to found their own company. Others join a mature company that offers many kinds
of expertise in business and production.

Industrial Microbiology Aims
for Commercial Success

Carol Nacy (Fig. 16.33A) studied tropical infectious diseases for 17 years at the Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research. She saw the need to fight tuberculosis, a disease that is the world’s number one killer of women aged
15–44 and the leading killer of men, after traffic accidents.
The United States spends $1 billion yearly to treat 13,000
incident cases; yet the standard antibiotics for tuberculosis
were developed before 1970, and the main diagnostic test
available (the tuberculin skin test) dates to 1880, the time
of Robert Koch. The best available vaccine—the Bacille
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) live, attenuated vaccine—is only
50% effective.
Nacy obtained business experience by working for several years as a chief scientific officer for the pharmaceutical

The practical application of a microbial product or device
may arise out of an industrial laboratory, or it may be conceived by a research scientist with the aim of meeting a
compelling need in society. In all cases, however, the key
goal is to succeed in the marketplace—that is, to generate
a product that customers adopt over alternative technologies. The product’s sales must cover the costs of raw materials and production and (in a for-profit company) generate a
profit for the shareholders. Success requires:

company EntreMed, Inc. She then founded her own company, Sequella, to develop innovative drugs and treatment
devices. Sequella targets innovative ideas with high risk but
also high potential to improve performance, rapidity, and
safety of diagnosing and treating TB infections. Nacy and
her cofounders scanned the academic community for novel
ideas that had succeeded against TB in “proof of principle”
animal models. The most promising ideas were developed
for improved antibiotics, rapid and less invasive tests for TB
exposure, and devices to measure the extent of pulmonary
infection. Because any one idea had a high risk of failure,
researchers pursued multiple prospects in each category.
The company also took on multiple target diseases, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).
Sequella’s most promising antibiotic, SQ109, was discovered by high-throughput screening of a chemical
library, in collaboration with Clifton Barry at the National
Institutes of Health. The chemical library consisted of
over 60,000 analogs of a known TB antibiotic, ethambutol (Fig. 16.33B). Ethambutol is part of the current standard treatment for TB, whose 6-month time course has a
poor compliance rate. It is hoped that improved drugs will
shorten the time course and improve compliance, thereby
decreasing the appearance of drug-resistant strains. The
analog molecules were selected for their common diamine
core, with different combinations of side chains. The
60,000 compounds in the library were subjected to combinatorial screening, a mathematically intensive analysis
based on numerous tests. Of the compounds tested, 2,796
showed activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the
test tube. The 69 best compounds were tested for cytotoxicity in tissue culture, activity in TB-infected macrophages,
and activity in infected animals. The compound with the

Microbial Products

Companies such as Sequella seek agents to combat microbial pathogens, but increasingly, industry seeks beneficial
microbes from natural sources to produce useful products. The microbe is cultured to synthesize a commercially
valuable chemical substance such as the industrial enzyme
lipase B (see the Current Research Highlight), or a material for manufacturing. An example of a microbial material
used for manufacture is alginate (Fig. 16.34A). Alginate
is a carboxylated polysaccharide, which has long been harvested commercially from giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera
(Fig. 16.34B). The kelps harvested for alginate are “brown
algae,” eukaryotic microbes (discussed in Chapter 20). The
product alginate has many commercial uses, as a thickener
for food products from ice cream to faux caviar, a textile
printing agent, and a modeling material for dental materials and life casting (Fig. 16.34C). Alginate is just one of
a mushrooming number of products in what we call the
fermentation industry.
Examples of commercial microbial products are listed
in Table 16.4. Each product requires a gene or operon of
genes encoding either the product itself or the enzymes for
the product’s biosynthesis. For example, the Danish company Novozymes markets over 700 microbial enzymes for
products ranging from laundry detergents to agricultural
inoculants (discussed in Special Topic 16.1). Novozymes
also produces numerous enzymes as biocatalysts for green
chemistry. “Green chemistry” refers to environmentally
friendly procedures for reactions in organic chemistry, typically using water solution in place of petroleum-derived
organic solvents.
We may distinguish between two fundamentally different sources of products: cloned genes from human,
animal, or plant sources; and native microbial products

from newly discovered species in the environment, often
from extreme conditions. Cloned human genes typically encode a protein of valuable function in the human
body. For example, Therabron Therapeutics produces
the recombinant human protein CC10, a lung development protein that is often deficient in the lungs of premature infants. The recombinant protein, produced and
purified from a recombinant bacterium, can be used to
reduce lung inflammation in premature infants, as well
as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). Cloning gene products in recombinant organisms was discussed in Chapter 12.
To identify new microbial products, companies screen
thousands of microbial strains from diverse ecosystems. The
search for organisms with potential commercial applications is called bioprospecting. Bioprospecting can be done
anywhere, from one’s backyard to Yellowstone National
Park. Unique ecosystems are the most promising sources of
previously unknown microbial strains with valuable properties. Extreme environments such as the hot springs of
Yellowstone are particularly promising because their products may tolerate higher temperatures that are required for
industrial use. Psychrophiles from extremely cold environments such as Antarctica are a useful source for enzymes
that are active in a wide range of temperatures, such as the
lipase from Candida antarctica (see the Current Research
Highlight). Unfortunately, many such unique ecosystems
are endangered by pollution, human-introduced invasive
species, and global climate change.
An important aspect of bioprospecting is “mining the
genome.” Once a promising source strain is obtained, its

genome is sequenced to investigate the genetic sequences
that encode the useful product and regulate its expression. The operons encoding the product (or enzymes for
its production) can then be cloned for optimal production
(see Chapter 12). The cloned genes are transferred into an
industrial strain, a strain whose growth characteristics are
well studied and optimized for industrial production. An
industrial strain must possess the following attributes:
■

Genetic stability and manipulation. The industrial
strain must reproduce reliably, without major DNA rearrangements. It must also have an efficient gene transfer
system by which vectors can introduce genes of interest
into its genome.

■

Inexpensive growth requirements. Industrial strains
must grow on low-cost carbon sources with minimal
special needs, such as vitamins, and at easily maintained
conditions of temperature and gases.

■

Safety. Industrial strains must be nonpathogenic and
must not produce toxic by-products.

■

High level of product expression. The strain or recombinant vector must possess an efficient gene expression
system to generate the desired product as a high proportion of its cell mass.

■

Ready harvesting of product. Either the product must
be secreted by the cell or, if the product is intracellular,
the cells must be easily breakable to liberate the product.

Common species for industrial strains include the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the yeast Candida utilis, and the

oxygenation throughout the vessel and minimizing foaming of the culture liquid. A small change in any of the
growth factors can impact production costs and profit margin. Another major concern is to avoid contamination by
other organisms.
The fermentor is the core of the first half of industrial
production, known as upstream processing (Fig. 16.36,
top). Upstream processing refers to the culturing of the
industrial microbe to produce large quantities of product
or cell mass. All aspects of the process must be controlled
to maximize the final concentration of product, which
in most cases peaks at a specific time in the microbial
growth cycle. Following microbial growth, the culture
must be harvested and the product purified. These processes constitute downstream processing (Fig. 16.36,
bottom). The first step of downstream processing is to
separate the microbial cells from the culture fluid, by
centrifugation or by filtration. Next, the primary recovery of product follows one of two different pathways,
depending on whether the product is maintained within
the cells or secreted into the culture fluid. Many kinds of
subsequent purification and finishing steps are necessary
before the product has acceptable quality for its desired
use. Again, failure of any detail can render the entire
product unusable.

Products designed for human consumption or use in
the environment face formidable hurdles in clinical testing, toxicological studies, and, finally, approval by the
appropriate regulatory agency, such as the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). After millions of dollars are invested in process development, the product may
still fail one of these late-stage hurdles and never come to
market. Not surprisingly, a company must research thousands of potential products before achieving one that
makes a profit. The consumer cost inevitably includes the
development costs not only of the one successful product,
such as recombinant insulin, but also of all the products
that failed.
Despite all the hurdles to overcome, companies such
as Novozymes sell hundreds of products and make billion-dollar profits. Examples of commercially successful
products are described in Special Topic 16.1.

Production in Plant or
Animal Host Systems

Some products require subtle processing that occurs correctly only within eukaryotic cells. For example, protein
products may require posttranslational modifications such
as glycosylation (attachment of polysaccharide chains).

SPECIAL TOPIC 16.1,, Microbial Enzymes Make Money
How can we clean our clothes with less pollution and keep
their colors bright? Can we remove carcinogens from our food
and increase crop yields with less environmental impact? The
answers to these questions lie in the microbial genomes. Microbial genes encode enzymes with properties worth hundreds of
billions of dollars. But it takes a sophisticated research company to discover enzymes, develop them, and make a profit.
One of the foremost microbial companies today is Novozymes. Founded in 1925, the company produced insulin and
trypsin by extraction from animal tissues—a laborious, expensive process. In 1963, Novozymes introduced its first product of
microbial fermentation: the detergent enzyme Alcalase. In the
1980s the company took up genetic modification (recombiWashed 25 times

nant DNA) to develop dozens of profitable microbial enzymes
for cleaning, including Lipolase, a lipase (fat cleavage) from
the fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus; and Protamex, a protease (protein cleavage) from Bacillus bacteria. These enzymes
break down and solubilize various components of food stains.
Active at room temperature, these enzymes precisely remove
the most common food stains while avoiding the energyexpensive heating of water. They also avoid the need for phosphate detergents, which pollute waterways.
Some cleaning enzymes actually improve the appearance
of clothing. The cellulase Carezyme, for example, hydrolyzes
short, frayed ends of cellulose that project from a cotton
garment after many cleanings (Fig. 1). Cotton consists of

In such cases, the expressed genes must be transferred from
a bacterial or viral vector into an animal, fungal, or plant
tissue culture or to a transgenic organism. The microbially transformed organism may itself be the industrial product. Here we present an example of microbial production
involving the plant engineering bacterium Agrobacterium
tumefaciens. A second example, that of an insect caterpillar
virus, is presented in eTopic 16.2.
Bacteria and viruses provide the vectors for transferring genes into multicellular organisms, as discussed in

Asparaginase prevents formation of acrylamide.

Asparaginase converts asparagine into aspartic acid. Without the
action of asparaginase, asparagine combines with sugar at high
temperature (the Maillard reaction) and then releases acrylamide.

Chapter 12. A bacterium of major industrial importance
is A. tumefaciens, a tumor-inducing plant pathogen that
conducts natural genetic engineering on dicot plants
(Fig. 16.37 ). Agrobacterium strains have now been
adapted by scientists to engineer even monocots. Long
before scientists invented “recombinant DNA,” A. tumefaciens had evolved a gene transfer system by which it
induces infected plant cells to generate food molecules
to feed the pathogen. This highly efficient gene transfer system is readily modified to insert genes conferring

crystalline fibers of cellulose (a glucose polysaccharide, discussed in Chapter 13). Cutting the frayed ends removes the
fuzzy appearance, restoring the solid color of the garment.
But why does this powerful enzyme not destroy the entire
garment? The enzyme has been engineered for high specificity: It cleaves only the highly disordered stray fibrils, not the
ordered cellulose of the intact fabric. The enzyme was originally isolated from a species of Bacillus that uses it to catabolize plant material.
Novozymes develops a number of enzymes with exciting
applications for food production. In 2002, food scientists
reported in Nature that high-temperature cooking of many
foods results in formation of acrylamide, a carcinogen. The
acrylamide forms in foods such as bread crusts and crackers,
French fries, and coffee. It was shown to arise from a reaction between sugar and amino acids, particularly the amino
acid asparagine (Fig. 2). First the asparagine condenses with
the sugar by a mechanism known as the Maillard reaction. The
molecule then rearranges, releasing acrylamide.
How can the acrylamide production be prevented? Novozymes scientists reasoned that most of the acrylamide production could be avoided by pretreatment of the food with

the enzyme asparaginase, which deaminates asparagine to
aspartic acid. They obtained the asparaginase gene from a
strain of the fungus Aspergillus. An industrial organism was
engineered to produce the enzyme in quantity, and marketed
as Acrylaway. Figure 3 outlines the use of Acrylaway to avoid
acrylamide production in French fries. The enzyme is added to
potato strips during the dipping step, before the potatoes are
dried and fried. Because the enzyme is completely “natural,”
it introduces no new toxin. Industrial trials completed in 2012
confirmed that Acrylaway effectively protects many kinds of
food from carcinogenic acrylamide.

traits of interest, such as herbicide resistance, into plant
genomes.
Tumorigenic strains of A. tumefaciens possess a special
plasmid for engineering plant cells, called the Ti plasmid
(tumor-inducing plasmid). The Ti plasmid is the source of
the genetic material that gets transferred into a plant cell
through a process mediated by bacterial proteins, similar
to conjugation (see Section 9.1). The Ti plasmid includes
the vir operons, which encode a virulence system, as well
as the T-DNA (transferable DNA), a set of genes that will

be transferred to the host plant and recombined into its
genome. T-DNA encodes tumor induction genes, such as
auxin synthesis genes, as well as enzymes for biosynthesis
of a carbon and nitrogen source called an opine. Opines
are specialized amino acids made by a one-step synthesis
from arginine, typically by amination of a central metabolite such as pyruvate or 2-oxoglutarate. A given strain of A.
tumefaciens typically provides one type of opine synthesis
enzyme and has the ability to metabolize the corresponding opine.

containing opine synthesis genes into a plant, which then produces opines to feed the bacteria. Right: A. tumefaciens can be engineered to

divided into two separate plasmids: one containing the vir operon conducting DNA transfer, the other containing T-DNA with most of its
genes substituted by a desired recombinant gene.

The Agrobacterium vector transfers its DNA to the
plant by means of the vir gene products. The vir gene
products from the Ti plasmid detect the presence of a
plant host and stimulate plasmid transfer (see Fig. 16.37,
left). In the cell envelope, VirA protein detects a chemical
signal from a wounded plant, which is capable of being
infected. VirA then activates VirG to induce expression
of other vir genes, encoding endonucleases VirD1 and
VirD2, and the VirB secretion complex. The VirD endonucleases cleave the left and right ends of the T-DNA and
direct its transfer into the plant cell through the VirB system. Within the plant cell nucleus, the T-DNA becomes
integrated into the plant genome, where it induces opine

production. The opine-producing cells proliferate, forming a tumor.
For industrial use (Fig. 16.37, right), a recombinant
strain of A. tumefaciens has the Ti plasmid divided into
two separate plasmids. One contains the vir operons conducting DNA transfer, while the other contains T-DNA
with its left and right ends intact but its genes substituted by the desired recombinant genes. Upon infection,
the virulence system induces transfer of the T-DNA to
the plant cell without any tumor-inducing genes, allowing genomic integration of the recombinant genes with
their desired traits, without tumor induction or opine
production.

Thought Question

16.11 Why would an herbicide resistance gene be desirable
in an agricultural plant? What long-term problems might be
caused by microbial transfer of herbicide resistance genes
into plant genomes?

Microbe as Product

Microbes as biological agents possess enormous potential
for environmental use. The most well known example is
the bacterial insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis (discussed in
Chapter 12). Such microbes, derived from natural sources,
may improve crop production and enhance agricultural sustainability. Most methods used by farmers to improve crop
yields require large amounts of fertilizer and pest management, including herbicides and fungicides. To alleviate the
financial and environmental impacts of large-scale farming,
scientists are working to develop microbial solutions that
can supplement chemical additives and pesticides, resulting
in higher yields to farmers.
Scientists at Novozymes partner with Monsanto to conduct large-scale bioprospecting. The scientists screen thousands of microbes for positive impacts on agriculture. Some
of the microbial products result in higher corn yields across
North America. One example is JumpStart, which consists
of the mold Penicillium bilaii (Fig. 16.38A). The mold

Industrial microbiology includes the production of

Bioprospecting is the mass screening of new microbial
strains for promising traits and potential use in a product. Thermophiles and psychrophiles are particularly
important sources of new strains with potentially interesting new properties.
Microbial products must be competitive with alternative technologies. Developing a competitive new molecular product requires identifying a useful molecule,
isolating and developing a fermentation technique to produce it,
scaling up for production in quantity, developing a business plan,
and testing for safety.

Another microbial product is Actinovate, a biological fungicide used for the suppression of root rot and damping-off
fungi, as well as the suppression or control of leaf fungal
pathogens. The active ingredient of Actinovate is the actinomycete Streptomyces lydicus (Fig. 16.38B). S. lydicus grows
as a mutualist associated with the roots of crop plants. The
bacteria feed off plant exudates while secreting antimicrobial
substances that suppress pathogens. These examples are the
start of a growing field of microbial applications for improving agriculture in an environmentally sustainable manner.

Bacteria evolve before our eyes. Two Escherichia coli clones
compete, marked by genetic traits that make colonies appear red or white with an indicator dye. The proportion of
colonies with each color shows which clone outcompetes
the other. For example, if red colonies can metabolize citrate
in the growth medium, whereas white colonies do not, then
the red colonies will outnumber the white colonies, indicating
greater fitness. This competition assay measures the relative
fitness of bacteria from Richard Lenski’s Long-Term Evolution Experiment. In this experiment, E. coli evolved a surprising way to metabolize the medium’s citrate buffer. Caroline
Turner discovered that some clones evolved a cooperative
relationship in which one clone obtains nutrients produced by
a different clone that catabolizes citrate.

icrobial life appeared as early as 3.8 billion years ago, soon after our planet, Earth,
formed out of dust surrounding the young
Sun. Since then, microbes have evolved into forms
adapted to diverse ways of life, from psychrophiles
beneath the ice of Antarctica to anaerobes in the
human colon. All living plants and animals, including
ourselves, are descendants of those early microbes.

The persistence of the citrate-minus
bacteria is remarkable because the
citrate-plus bacteria had such a big
advantage. They had sole access to
a large pool of resources. To me, the
survival of the citrate-minus bacteria
is a beautiful example of the power of ecology—how having
a distinct ecological niche (metabolizing waste products of
citrate catabolism) can allow organisms to coexist.

a concept called spontaneous generation (discussed in
Chapter 1). Others argued against spontaneous generation
and devised experiments to show that even microbes have
“parents.” Today, genetic evidence overwhelmingly confirms that all life on Earth, including microbes, arises from
preexisting life. But these experiments do not address the
origin of the very first living cells—or how early life gave
rise to multicellular plants and animals.
As early as 1802, the naturalist Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin, wrote:
Organic life beneath the shoreless waves
Was born and nurs’d in ocean’s pearly caves;
First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;
These, as successive generations bloom,
New powers acquire and larger limbs assume.
Thus, nineteenth-century biologists developed the idea
that “minute” life-forms arose in the ocean—and that all
organisms evolved from microbes, perhaps even from cells
too small to be seen with the “spheric glass” of a microscope.
Even without the tools of genetics, thoughtful observers
recognized the commonalities among all living cells, such
as the membrane-enclosed compartment of cytoplasm and
common metabolic pathways like sugar metabolism. Today,
lines of evidence from geology, biochemistry, and genetics
overwhelmingly support the microbial origin of life.
What might the first life-forms have looked like?

Early Life

Microbiologists find clues to the nature of early life in a
place where today only the most rudimentary life-forms
exist: the Dry Valleys of Antarctica (Fig. 17.1). The valleys’ cold, dry winters (–40°C) preclude most multicellular

life. But in the austral summer (January), temperatures rise
above zero and glacier melt trickles into streams. Longdormant cyanobacteria come to life, painting the streams
orange (Fig. 17.1A). They photosynthesize throughout the
24-hour daylight, fixing CO2 and bubbling oxygen. The
cyanobacteria can grow into thick masses of biofilm, called
microbial mats (Fig. 17.1B). The mats support communities of protists and nematodes. Microbial ecologists such as
Jessica Trout-Haney, Dartmouth College, study what happens to microbial mats as the climate warms.
Antarctic microbial mats bear a striking resemblance to
Australian fossils that date to 3.48 billion years (gigayears,
or Gyr) before today (Fig. 17.1C). These fossils, from the
Dresser Formation, Pilbara Craton, were identified by geologist Nora Noffke, from Old Dominion University. The
fossils formed as silicate grains sedimented in the mat and
gradually replaced its organic structure. The sedimentary
layers and wrinkled surface remain visible after billions of
years. Remarkably, similar rock formations appear on Mars,
offering evidence that our neighbor planet, too, supported
ancient microbial life (shown in Chapter 1).

Note:

In geological description, a billion years (109) is a gigayear, or Gyr. A million years (106) is a megayear, or Myr.

Ancient microbes formed even more complex microbial
communities, called stromatolites (Fig. 17.2A). A stromatolite is a bulbous mass of layered limestone (calcium
carbonate, CaCO3) accreted by microbial mats. The mat
layers can build over centuries, even more than a thousand
years, reaching heights over 2 meters. The outermost layers
of the mat contain oxygenic phototrophs, such as diatoms
and filamentous cyanobacteria, that exude bubbles of oxygen. A few millimeters below the surface, red light supports
bacteria photolyzing H 2S to sulfate, which is then reduced

another kind of cross-feeding, like that shown by Caroline
Turner in the Long-Term Evolution Experiment.
Stromatolites today grow mainly in tidal pools whose
high salt concentration excludes predators, as in Hamlin
Pool, Shark Bay, Australia. But 3 billion years ago, stromatolites covered shallow seas all over Earth. Fossil stromatolites appear in Pilbara Craton’s 3.4-Gyr granite
(Fig. 17.2B). The rock layers preserve the wavy form of the
microbial mats, similar to living stromatolites.

the earliest fossil life shows organized structures such as a stromatolite built by cooperating cells. How could this be explained?

the great mysteries of science. But we know certain things
that life required:

■

Temperature range permitting liquid water. Above
150°C, life’s macromolecules fall apart; below the freezing point of water, metabolic reactions cease. Maintaining the relatively narrow temperature range conducive
to life depends on the nature of our Sun, our planet’s
distance from the Sun, and the heat-trapping capacity of
our atmosphere.

Elements of Life

For life to arise and multiply, elements such as carbon and
oxygen needed to be available on Earth. The planet Earth
coalesced during formation of the solar system 4.5 Gyr ago.
Central to the solar system is our Sun, a “yellow” star of
medium size and surface temperature (5,770 K). The Sun’s
surface temperature generates electromagnetic radiation
across the spectrum, peaking in the range of visible light.
As we learned in Chapter 13, the photon energies of visible
light are sufficient to drive photosynthesis but not so energetic that they destroy biomolecules. Thus, the stellar class
of our Sun makes organic life possible.
The Sun’s surface temperature and luminosity are generated by nuclear fusion reactions in which hydrogen
nuclei fuse to form helium nuclei. (Be careful
to distinguish nuclear reactions, involving
nuclei, from chemical reactions, involving
electrons.) Besides hydrogen and helium,
2% of the solar mass consists of heavier
elements, such as carbon, nitrogen,
and oxygen, as well as traces of iron
and other metals—elements that
compose Earth, including its living
organisms. Where did these heavier

hydrogen gone, the aging star contracts and its temperature rises, enabling helium nuclei to fuse, forming carbon
(see Fig. 17.3). Carbon drives a cyclic nuclear reaction, the
CNO (carbon-nitrogen-oxygen) cycle, to form isotopes of
nitrogen and oxygen. Subsequent nuclear reactions generate heavier elements through iron (Fe). In this way, the

CHAPTER 17

major elements of biomolecules were formed within stars
that aged before our solar system was born.
The later nuclear reactions of aging stars generate heavier
nuclei, as large as that of iron. The aging star expands,
forming a red giant (see Fig. 17.3). When a star of sufficient mass expands (becoming a supergiant), it explodes
as a supernova. The explosion of a supernova generates in a
brief time all the heaviest elements and ejects the entire contents of the star at near light speed. Billions of years before
our Sun was born, the first stars aged and died, spreading
all the elements of the periodic table across the universe.
Some of these elements coalesced with our Sun and formed
the planets of our solar system. In effect, all life on Earth is
made of stardust, the remains of stars long gone.

Thought Question

17.2 What would have happened to life on Earth if the Sun
were a different stellar class, substantially hotter or colder
than it is?

Elemental composition of Earth. When our solar sys-

tem formed, individual planets coalesced out of matter
attracted by the force of gravity. Because of Earth’s small
size, most of the hydrogen gas escaped Earth’s gravity very
early. The most abundant dense component of Earth was
iron (Fig. 17.4). Much of Earth’s iron sank to the center to form the core. The core is surrounded by a mantle, composed primarily of iron combined with less dense

section of Earth shows the core, the mantle, and the thin outer
crust. The core and mantle are rich in iron; oxygen content increases
toward the crust. The crust is composed primarily of silicates such as
quartz (SiO2). Crustal rock supports endolithic bacteria and archaea.

crystalline minerals such as silicates of iron and magnesium:
(Fe,Mg)2SiO4. The mantle is coated by Earth’s thin outer
crust. The crust is composed primarily of silicon dioxide,
SiO2, also known as quartz or chert. Crustal rock contains
smaller amounts of numerous minerals, including the carbonates and nitrates that provided the essential elements
for life. Overall, the crust shows a redox gradient, reducing
in the interior and oxidizing at the surface.
The crust provides a habitat for microbes to surprising depths, such as within gold mines excavated down to
3 kilometers (km). Some endolithic microbes (microbes living within rock) metabolize by oxidizing electron donors
generated through decay of radioactive metals. The discovery of endolithic organisms deep in the crust was of great
interest to NASA scientists seeking life on Mars. Of the
planets, Mars most closely resembles Earth in geology and
distance from the Sun, and its crust might provide a habitat
similar to Earth’s.
The outer surface of the crust and the atmosphere above
it support the remainder of the biosphere, the sum total of
all life on Earth. The biosphere generates oxidants (electron
acceptors), most notably O2. Oxygen-breathing organisms
can live only on the outer surface, where O2 is produced by
photosynthesis.
Earth’s atmosphere. From the crust and the mantle of

early Earth, volcanic activity released gases such as carbon
dioxide and nitrogen, which formed Earth’s fi rst atmosphere, while volcanic water vapor formed the ocean. The
composition of this fi rst atmosphere, before life evolved,
looked much like that of Mars: thin, about 1% as dense
as that of Earth today, consisting primarily of CO2. But
unlike Mars, Earth developed living organisms that fi lled
the atmosphere with gaseous N2 and O2 and that continue to produce these gases today. Organisms also produce CO2, as well as fi xing it into biomass. Some CO2 and
N2 arise from geological sources such as volcanoes, but
their contribution is small compared to that of biological
cycles (discussed in Chapter 22). The overall composition
of Earth’s atmosphere is determined by living organisms,
primarily microbes.
Temperature. Another important aspect of Earth’s habitat,

determined by the atmospheric density and composition,
is temperature. Atmospheric gases absorb light and convert the energy to heat, raising the temperature of the surface and atmosphere. This rise in temperature is known as
the greenhouse effect. Because carbon dioxide is an especially potent greenhouse gas, the CO2-rich atmosphere of
early Earth could have heated the planet to temperatures
approaching those of Venus, eliminating the possibility of
life. Instead, microbial consumption of CO2 and generation of nitrogen and oxygen gases limited Earth’s surface
