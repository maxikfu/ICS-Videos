{"id": 10, "text": "Do Microbes Have Parents? \n\nThe observation of microscopic organisms led priests and philosophers to wonder where these tiny beings came from. In the eighteenth century, scientists and church leaders intensely debated the question of spontaneous generation. Spontaneous generation is the concept that living creatures such as maggots could arise spontaneously, without parental organisms. Chemists of the day tended to support spontaneous generation, as it appeared similar to the way chemicals changed during reaction. Christian church leaders, however, supported the biblical view that all organisms have \u201cparents\u201d going back to the first week of creation. The Italian priest Francesco Redi (1626\u20131697) showed that maggots in decaying meat were the offspring of flies. Meat kept in a sealed container, excluding flies, did not produce maggots. Thus, Redi\u2019s experiment argued against spontaneous generation for macroscopic organisms. The meat still putrefied, however, producing microbes that seemed to arise \u201cwithout parents.\u201d To disprove spontaneous generation of microbes, another Italian priest, Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729\u20131799), showed that a sealed flask of meat broth sterilized by boiling failed to grow microbes. Spallanzani also noticed that microbes often appeared in pairs. Were these two parental microbes coupling to produce offspring, or did one microbe become two? Through long and tenacious observation, Spallanzani watched a single microbe grow in size until it split in two. Thus he demonstrated cell fission, the process by which cells arise by the splitting of preexisting cells. Even Spallanzani\u2019s experiments, however, did not put the matter to rest. Proponents of spontaneous generation argued that the microbes in the priest\u2019s flask lacked access to oxygen and therefore could not grow. The pursuit of this question was left to future microbiologists, including the famous French microbiologist Louis Pasteur (1822\u20131895) related questions, Pasteur and his contemporaries laid the foundations for modern microbiology. Louis Pasteur reveals the biochemical basis of microbial growth. Pasteur began his scientific career as a chemist and wrote his doctoral thesis on the structure of organic crystals. He discovered the fundamental chemical property of chirality, the fact that some organic molecules exist in two forms that differ only by mirror symmetry. In other words, the two structures are mirror images of one another, like the right and left hands. Pasteur found that when microbes were cultured on a nutrient substance containing both mirror forms, only one mirror form was consumed."}

Today the petri dish, generally made of disposable plastic, remains an indispensable part of the microbiological laboratory. Another improvement in solid-substrate culture was the replacement of gelatin with materials that remain solid at higher temperatures, such as the gelling agent agar (a polymer of the sugar galactose). The use of agar was recommended by Angelina Hesse (1850\u20131934), a microscopist and illustrator, to her husband, Walther Hesse (1846\u2013 1911), a young medical colleague of Koch (Fig. 1.16).

Endosymbiotic bacteria known as rhizobia induce the roots of legumes to form special nodules to facilitate bacterial nitrogen fixation. Rhizobial endosymbiosis was first observed by Martinus Beijerinck. Microbial endosymbiosis, in a variety of diverse forms, is widespread in all ecosystems. Many interesting cases involve animal or human hosts. Endosymbiotic microbes make essential nutritional contributions to host animals. Ruminant animals such as cattle, as well as insects such as termites, require digestive bacteria to break down cellulose and other plant polymers. Even humans obtain about 15% of their nutrition from colonic bacteria (Fig. 1.25). Intestinal bacteria such as multispecies communities adhering to a surface. Biofilms play major roles in all ecosystems and within parts of the digested food particle. Most kinds of plant fibers that we consume actually require microbial enzymes to digest (see Chapter 21). Many invertebrates, such as hydras and corals, harbor endosymbiotic phototrophs that provide products of photosynthesis in return for protection and nutrients. Other kinds of endosymbiosis involve more than nutrition.

High-strength electron beams now permit low-temperature cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), also known as electron cryomicroscopy.

The rapid freezing avoids ice crystallization, leaving the water solvent in a glass-like amorphous phase. The specimen retains water content and thus closely resembles its living form, although it is still ultimately destroyed by electron bombardment. Another innovation made possible by cryo-EM is tomography, the acquisition of projected images from different angles of a transparent specimen (see the Current Research Highlight).

As with the carbon cycle, various groups of organisms collaborate to recycle ammonium ions and nitrate One group of bacteria gains energy by converting, or oxidizing, ammonia to form nitrate in a process called nitrification (Nitrosomonas, Alcaligenes, and Nitrobacter). Nitrification is a form of lithotrophy. Other heterotrophic for certain electron transport chains. Denitrifying bacteria send an amount of nitrogen into the atmosphere that roughly balances the amount removed by nitrogen fixation. Like the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle illustrates how nature manages to replenish planet Earth. For the environmental significance of nitrogen metabolism, see Chapter 22."}

In the membrane, GlpF reversibly (and randomly) assumes two conformations. One form exposes the glycerol-binding site to the external environment, whereas the second form exposes this site to the cytoplasm. When the concentration of glycerol is greater outside than inside the cell, the form with the binding site exposed to the exterior is more likely to find and bind glycerol. After binding glycerol, GlpF changes shape, closing itself to the exterior and released (diffuses) into the cytoplasm (influx). Of course, this form of GlpF could also bind a glycerol molecule in the cytoplasm and release it outside the cell. Thus, once the cytoplasmic concentration of glycerol equals the concentration outside the cell, bound glycerol can be released to either compartment.

When and where the second (cotransported) solute binds depends on whether the transport protein is an antiporter or a symporter. With all this ion traffic across the membrane going on, a careful accounting must be kept of how many ions are inside the cell relative to outside. The cell must recirculate ions back and forth across the membrane to maintain certain gradients if the organism is to survive. Because key ATPproducing systems require an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, it is especially important to keep the interior of the cell negatively charged relative to the exterior. However, because the movement of many compounds is coupled to the import of positive ions, the electrochemical gradient will eventually dissipate, or depolarize, unless positive ions are also exported. Depolarization must be avoided, because a depolarized cell loses membrane integrity and cannot carry out the transport functions needed balance by using the electron transport chain to move protons out of the cell and by using antiporters to exchange negatively and positively charged ions as needed. While symport and antiport systems directly link the transport of different ions, the movement of one ion can also be linked indirectly to movement of another molecule. For example, proton concentrations are typically greater outside the cell than inside. The inwardly directed proton gradient is called proton motive force. Proton motive force can impel the exit of Na+ through the Na+/H+ antiporter. The resulting Na+ gradient can then drive the symport of amino acids into the cell. In this case, Na+ moves back into the cell down its gradient, and the energy released is tied to the import of an amino acid against its gradient."}

Since antibiotics were introduced over 70 years ago, bacterial pathogens have continually evolved to resist their effects. Scientists, for their part, have struggled to find new antibiotics to replace the old, ineffective ones. Chapter 27 will discuss this \u201carms race\u201d in more detail. The classic approach for finding new antibiotics is to screen bacteria and fungi snatched from exotic environments such as the Amazon for secreted antimicrobial compounds. This method worked for decades, but over the past 20 years was needed if we humans are to maintain dominance over we can detect can be cultured in the laboratory. This means we have missed capturing the antibiotic potential of over 99% of living microbes. These \u201cunculturable\u201d organisms are present in soil, water, and even the human body. Why do the microbes grow there but not in the lab? They grow in their natural environments because of interspecies cooperation. In this environmental \u201cbuddy system,\u201d one species provides a growth factor to another species that cannot make its own. Can we find a way to tame such uncooperative organisms and screen them for new antibiotics? Kim Lewis (Northeastern University, Boston) and colleagues have devised an elegant method to do just that. To harvest previously unculturable soil microbes, samples prepared from soil were diluted such that one bacterial cell was delivered into each channel of a multichannel iChip microbe could grow. Both sides of the device were covered with semipermeable membranes and placed back into the of the unculturable microbes to form colonies. Once a colony formed, the previously uncultured organism became \u201cdomesticated,\u201d able to grow on agar medium without further assistance. The mechanism of domestication is not yet The scientists made extracts from 10,000 iChip isolates and tested each one for antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus, an important pathogen that can cause infections ranging from boils to sepsis. One extract was highly effective. The Gram-negative organism that produced this antibiotic was sequenced and named Eleftheria terrae (Fig. 2). The structure of the antibiotic, teixobactin, is shown enzymes instead of a ribosome (nonribosomal peptide synthesis is described in Special Topic 15.1). The cellular target of teixobactin is peptidoglycan synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria (the peptide cannot penetrate the Gram-negative outer membrane). The new antibiotic kills bacteria by binding to the lipid carrier molecule, bactoprenol, that ferries the peptidoglycan subunits N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid across the bacterial membrane (described in Chapter 3). As a result, growing cells lyse because they cannot make new cell wall. Chapter 27 describes the details of peptidoglycan synthesis and the antibiotics that target steps in this process."}

For example, if 100 colonies are observed in a pour plate made with 100 microliters (\u00b5l) of a 10 \u20133 dilution of a culture, then there were 106 organisms per milliliter in the original culture. illustrates these types of Although viable counts are widely used in research, this method is problematic for measuring cell number. One issue is that colony counting does not reflect cell size or growth stage. Even more problematic, colony counts usually underestimate the number of living cells in a culture. Cells damaged for one reason or another can remain metabolically active and alive but may be too compromised to divide. Because these cells will not form colonies on an agar plate, they will not be counted as living. Comparing a viable count with a direct count obtained from a live/dead stain can expose the presence of these damaged cells. Another challenge is any organism that grows in chains, such as Streptococcus, because each colony originates from a group of cells, not a single cell. Consequently, counting colonies underestimates actual cell number. For this reason, viable counts are reported as colony-forming units (CFUs) rather than cells. Biochemical assays. In contrast to methods that visualize individual cells, assays of cell biomass, protein content, or metabolic rate measure the overall size of a population of cells. The most straightforward but timeconsuming biochemical approach to monitoring population growth is to measure the dry weight of a culture. Cells are collected by centrifugation, washed, dried in an oven, and weighed. Because bacterial cells weigh very little, a large volume of culture must be harvested to obtain measurements, making this technique quite increases in protein levels, which correlate with increases in cell number. Protein levels are more easily measured with relatively sensitive assays. Optical density measures growth in real time. The phe- nomenon of light scattering was introduced in Chapter 2. Recall that the presence of bacteria in a tube of medium can be detected by how cloudy the medium appears as the cells scatter light. The decrease in intensity of a light beam due to the scattering of light by a suspension of particles is measured as optical density."}
{"id": 165, "text": "The optical density of light scattered by bacteria is a very useful tool for estimating population size. The method is quick and easy, but because light scattering is a complex function of cell number and cell volume, optical density provides only an approximate result that must be corrected using a standard curve. Typically, a standard curve is obtained that plots viable counts for cultures versus optical densities as measured by a spectrophotometer. Thereafter, the optical density of a growing culture is measured, and the standard curve is used to estimate cell number at any given point during growth. One problem with using optical density to estimate cell numbers is that a cell\u2019s volume can vary depending on its growth stage, altering its light-scattering properties. Thus, the cell number estimated by the standard curve may deviate from the true number. Another problem is that dead cells also scatter light. Clearly, using optical density to estimate viable count can be misleading, especially when measuring populations in stationary phase. \n\nMicrobes in nature usually exist in complex, multispecies communities, but for detailed studies they must be grown separately in pure culture. Bacteria can be cultured on solid or liquid media. Defined or synthetic media contain only chemical components that are known. Minimal defined media contain only the defined nutrients essential for growth of a given organism. Complex, or rich, media contain many nutrients. Other media exploit physiological differences between organisms and can be defined as selective, differential, or both (for example, MacConkey medium). Microbes can evolve to become unculturable or to require specific growth factors depending on the nutrient richness of their natural ecological niche. Obligate intracellular bacteria lose metabolic pathways provided by their hosts and develop requirements for growth factors supplied by their hosts.

Such a growth rate is called \u201cexponential\u201d because it generates an exponential curve, a curve whose slope increases continually. How does binary fission of cells generate an exponential curve? If each cell produces two cells per generation, then the population size at any given time is proportional to 2n, where the exponent n represents the number of generations (that is, cell divisions in which offspring replace parents) that have taken place between two time points. Thus, cell number rises exponentially. Many microbes, however, have replication cycles based on numbers other than 2.

Determining microbial death rates is critical to the study of food preservation and to the development of antibiotics (further discussed in Chapters 5, 16, and 27). Although death curves are basically logarithmic, exact death rates are difficult to define because mutations arise that promote survival, and some cells grow by cannibalizing others.

Although a species\u2019 physiology is geared to work within only a narrow range of physical parameters, in nature the environment can change quickly and dramatically. Many marine microbes, for instance, move within seconds from deep-sea cold to the searing heat of a thermal vent. How do these organisms survive? Most species have stopgap measures called stress responses that temporarily protect the organism from brief forays into potentially lethal environments. But some organisms evolve to thrive, not just survive, in extreme environments. How do these so-called extremophiles grow under conditions that would kill most living things? In addition to environmental threats, microbes in nature wage wars among themselves by secreting antimicrobial compounds. Why doesn\u2019t the toxin-producing microbe kill itself? Is it somehow immune to its own toxin? Knowledge about how microbes cope with their environments, and each other, is exploited by humans to prevent the growth of bacteria in foods, destroy disease-causing microbes, and develop new microbe-based industries. We begin this chapter by describing how physical and chemical changes in the environment impact the growth of different groups of microbes. We also explore how microorganisms adapt to different environments in ways both transient (involving temporary expression of genes) and permanent (modifications of the gene pool). The permanent genetic changes have led to biological diversity. Finally, we examine the different ways humans try to limit the growth of microorganisms to protect plants, animals, and ourselves. As you proceed through this chapter, you will encounter two recurring themes: that different groups of microbes live in vastly different environments, and that microbes can respond in diverse ways when confronted by conditions outside their niche, or comfort zone.

The principles of physical chemistry dictate that a solute present at different concentrations in two chambers separated by a semipermeable membrane will tend to equilibrate. But if the semipermeable membrane does not allow solutes to move through the membrane, then osmolarity will equilibrate by water moving between the chambers. For a cell in a hypertonic medium, where the external osmolarity is higher than the internal, water will leave the cell in an attempt to equalize osmolarity across the membrane. In contrast, suspending a cell in a hypotonic medium (one of lower osmolarity than the cell) will cause an influx of water (see eAppendix 2). Water does not move across cell membranes primarily by simple diffusion. Instead, special membrane water channels formed by proteins called aquaporins enable water to traverse the membrane much faster than by unmediated diffusion. Rapid movement of water helps protect cells against osmotic stress (Fig. 5.7). However, too much water moving in or out of a cell is detrimental.

In other cases, phages were given orally, introduced via aerosol, or injected. Sometimes the treatments worked; sometimes they did not.

{"id": 237, "text": "While viruses are the tiniest of biological entities, they play starring roles in ecosystems. Acute viruses (which rapidly kill their hosts) act as predators or parasites to limit host population density. They also recycle nutrients from their host bodies. An increase in host population density increases the rate of transmission of viral pathogens. As the host population declines, viruses are less likely to find a new host before they lose infectivity, while many of the remaining hosts have undergone selection for resistance. Thus, viruses can limit host density without causing extinction of the host. In a community of multiple host species, the overall effect of viruses is to increase host diversity. Each viral species has a limited host range and requires a critical population density to sustain the chain of infection. In marine phytoplankton, a virus limits its host species to a population density far lower than what is sustainable by the available resources, such as light for photosynthesis. The resources then support other species resistant to the given virus (but susceptible to other ones). Thus, overall, marine viruses prevent the dominance of any one species and foster the evolution of many distinct host species. The continual threat of marine viral epidemics explains the great diversity of phytoplankton ranging from silica-shelled diatoms to toxin-producing dinoflagellates. Persistent viruses (viruses that don\u2019t immediately kill the host) may benefit the host population overall. Most important, viruses transfer genes across species, conferring traits such as the ability to metabolize new food sources. Humans harbor many obscure herpes and cold-type viruses that stimulate normal development of the immune system. In natural mammal populations, a persistent virus can act as a bioweapon that kills off competitor populations susceptible to the virus. An example is the koala retrovirus, KoRV, which has become endogenous (persistent) in many koala populations of Australia.

The wasp genome contains an integrated genome (or provirus) of a virus called polydnavirus. The polydnavirus forms its own genomes and virions only within the wasp ovary. When the wasp deposits her eggs inside the host caterpillar, she also deposits her mutualistic virions. The virions express proteins that prevent the caterpillar cells from undergoing encapsulation, a process that would otherwise wall off the wasp eggs and kill them. In marine ecosystems, viruses play a significant role in the cycling of food molecules (Fig. 6.6). In ocean food webs, phytoplankton is consumed by grazers, and grazers are eaten by higher trophic consumers (discussed in Chapter 21). But at each level, some of the carbon fixed as biomass sinks to the ocean floor. There, benthic microbes metabolize so slowly that most carbon is effectively removed from the carbon cycle. At the same time, viral infection and lysis convert the bodies of phytoplankton, grazers, and carnivores into detritus consisting of small organic particles and soluble molecules. The viral detritus gets taken up by heterotrophs, and minerals are absorbed by autotrophs. This uptake of viral detritus is called the viral shunt.

For example, a donor strain that can synthesize the amino acids alanine and proline can directly transfer the encoding genes to a recipient cell defective in those genes. The transfer process is nonspecific, so any gene can be transferred in this way. Completion of transfer also requires recombination, acid synthesis enables the formerly defective recipient to form colonies on minimal media lacking either amino acid. Because chromosome transfer takes time and starts from a fixed point, not all genes are transferred simultaneously.

Many proteins are specifically destined for one or another of these cell compartments. Other proteins are secreted completely out of the cell into the surrounding environment (for example, hemolysins that lyse red blood cells). But how do these diverse proteins know where to go? Protein traffic out of the cell is directed by an elaborate set of protein secretion systems. Each system selectively delivers a set of proteins originally made in the cytoplasm to various extracytoplasmic locations. The term \u201csecretion\u201d is used to describe movement of a protein out of the cytoplasm. There are protein secretion systems that move proteins out of the cytoplasm into the cytoplasmic membrane and across the membrane to the periplasm, others that move proteins to the outer membrane, and still others that deliver proteins across both of the membranes and into the surrounding environment. An added complication of protein export is that periplasmic proteins are usually delivered unfolded into the periplasm and require another set of chaperones to fold properly in this cell compartment."}

Any mutation in argA is a genotypic change, but if the result is a synonymous amino acid substitution, then there is no phenotypic change; the organism can still make its own arginine.

Nealson was particularly intrigued by the high levels of reduced manganese (Mn2+) found in Lake Oneida, New York. He reasoned that only microbial activity could account for so much reduced manganese, compared to other lakes where manganese is in the oxidized form (Mn4+, as the insoluble mineral MnO2).

The practice of milk fermentation probably arose among herders who collected the milk of their pack animals but had no way to prevent the rapid growth of bacteria. The milk had to be stored in a portable container such as the stomach of a slaughtered animal. After hours of travel, the combined action of lactic acid\u2013producing bacteria and stomach enzymes caused the coagulation of milk proteins into curd. The curd naturally separated from the liquid portion, called whey. Both curds and whey can be eaten, as in the nursery rhyme \u201cLittle Miss Muffet.\u201d The curds, however, are particularly valuable for their concentrated protein content. \n\nmal (usually cow, sheep, or goat) in which the milk protein coagulates to form a semisolid curd. Curd formation results from two kinds of processes: acidification, usually as a result of the microbial production of lactic acid; and treatment by proteolytic enzymes such as rennet. The curd may then be separated and processed to varying degrees, depending on the type of cheese. How does milk coagulate? The major organic components of cow\u2019s milk are butterfat (about 4% unless skimmed), protein (3.3%), and the sugar lactose (4.7%). Milk starts out at about pH 6.6, very slightly acidic. At this pH, the milk proteins are completely soluble in water; otherwise they would clog the animal\u2019s udder as the milk came out. Fermentation generally begins with bacteria cheese.

{"id": 688, "text": "such as Lactobacillus and Streptococcus (Fig. 16.6). As bacteria ferment lactose to lactic acid, the pH starts to decline. The dissociation constant of lactic acid (pK a = 3.9) allows greater deprotonation than with other fermentation products, such as acetate (pK a = 4.8). Thus, lactic acid rapidly acidifies the milk product to levels that halt further growth of bacteria. Halting bacterial growth minimizes the oxidation of amino acids, thereby maintaining food quality. Milk contains micelles (suspended droplets) of hydrophobic proteins called caseins. As the pH of milk declines below pH 5, the acidic amino acid residues of caseins become protonated, eventually destabilizing the tertiary structure. As the casein molecules unfold (or \u201cdenature\u201d), they expose hydrophobic residues that regain stability by interacting with other hydrophobic molecules. The intermolecular interaction of caseins generates a gel-like network throughout the milk, trapping other substances, such as droplets of butterfat. This protein network generates the semisolid texture of yogurt, a simple product of milk acidified by lactic acid bacteria. In most kinds of cheese formation, an additional step of casein coagulation is accomplished by proteases such as rennet. Rennet derives from the fourth stomach of a calf, although modern versions are made by genetically engineered bacteria. Calf rennet includes two proteolytic enzymes: chymosin and pepsin. Chymosin specifically cleaves casein into two parts, one of which is charged and water-soluble, the other hydrophobic. The hydrophobic portion forms a firmer curd than intact casein and results in the harder texture of solid cheeses. The water-soluble portion, about one-third of the total casein, enters the whey and is lost from the curd.

Two different classes of microbial effects are distinguished: food spoilage and food contamination with pathogens. Food spoilage refers to microbial changes that render a product obviously unfit or unpalatable for consumption. For example, rancid milk or putrefied meats are unpalatable and contain metabolic products that may be deleterious to human health, such as oxidized fatty acids or organic amines. Even in these cases, however, the definition of spoilage depends partly on cultural practice. What is sour milk to one person may be buttermilk to another; what one society considers spoiled meat, another may consider merely aged. Different pathways of microbial metabolism lead to different kinds of spoilage. Sour flavors result from acid fermentation products, as in sour milk. Alkaline products generate bitter flavor. Oxidation, particularly of fats, causes rancidity, whereas general decomposition of proteins and amino acids leads to putrefaction.

We outline here three unresolved questions regarding the temperature of early Earth, the role of methane in the early atmosphere, and the actual source of Earth\u2019s first cells. Thermophile or psychrophile? The apparent existence of life so soon after Earth cooled suggests a thermophilic origin. Thermophily is supported by the fact that in the domains Bacteria and Archaea, the deepest-branching clades (that is, kinds of organisms that diverged the earliest from others in the domain) are thermophiles. Such organisms could have thrived at hydrothermal vents, which offer On the other hand, after meteoric bombardment abated, early Earth should have become glacially cold. In the Archaean, solar radiation was 20%\u201330% less intense than it habitat would support psychrophiles. Psychrophiles might were methanogens (methane producers). Methanogens are one of the most widely divergent groups of organisms and persist today in environments ranging from anaerobic sediment to the human intestine. Methanogenesis requires only carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas, which would have been plentiful in early anoxic sediment. The production of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, could have greatly increased Earth\u2019s temperature during the Archaean eon. Thus, methanogenesis could explain how Earth escaped the permanent freeze of Mars. Overheating would have been halted when the oxygen gas produced by cyanobacteria enabled growth of methanotrophs, bacteria that oxidize methane. The decline of methane and the rise The debate over the temperature and climate of early Earth has interesting implications for Earth today, when we again face the prospect of massive global climate change. Human agriculture favors explosive growth of methanogens, which threaten to accelerate global warming faster than the biosphere can moderate it. Understanding the climate of early Earth may help us better understand and manage our own climate, discussed in Chapter 22. Origin on Earth or elsewhere? Emerging evidence from fossils and geochemistry has inexorably pushed back the earliest known dates for several kinds of metabolism closer to 3.7 Gyr ago (see Fig. 17.11). This implies that as soon as Earth cooled to a temperature suitable for life, all the fundamental components of cells evolved almost immediately. How could life, with all its diverse kinds of metabolism, have arisen so quickly? The idea that life-forms originated elsewhere and \u201cseeded\u201d life on Earth is called panspermia. Theories of panspermia remain highly speculative. One hypothesis is that microbial cells originated on Mars and were then carried to Earth on meteorites.

Most phylogenetic data so far indicate a root between Bacteria and the common ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya; that is, Bacteria diverged from Archaea and Eukarya before Archaea and Eukarya diverged from each other. While the position of the root remains controversial, the three major divisions of life based on rRNA phylogeny have been confirmed by sequence data from the numerous genomes published to date. Furthermore, structural and physiological comparison of the three domains largely confirms the rRNA tree (Table 17.2). Note first that all living cells on Earth share profound similarities. All cells consist of membrane-enclosed compartments that shelter the same fundamental apparatus of cell production: the DNA-RNAprotein machine. The fundamental components of this machine appear to have evolved before the three domains diverged from their last universal common ancestor. From a molecular standpoint, all cells on Earth appear more similar than they are different. Nonetheless, important differences emerge between each pair of domains; indeed, each domain shows distinctive traits absent or scarce in the other two. We summarize here the major features common to most members of each domain. Various classes and species within each domain are explored in Chapters 18\u201320. Archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. Of the three domains, the eukaryotes stand out as having a nucleus and other complex membranous organelles (see Table 17.2). Eukaryotic organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts, which evolved from internalized bacteria. Bacteria and archaea possess no nucleus and have relatively simple intracellular membranes. Their size is limited by diffusion across the cell membrane, with occasional exceptions, such as the \u201cgiant bacterium\u201d Epulopiscium fishelsoni. The larger size and complexity of eukaryotic cells mean that they generally require the most highly powered sources of energy, such as aerobic respiration and oxygenic photosynthesis, although some protists conduct fermentation. By contrast, the prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) employ a wider range of metabolic alternatives, including lithotrophy and anaerobic respiration. Finally, eukaryotic plants and animals have attained a degree of multicellular complexity unknown in the prokaryotic domains. On the other hand, eukaryotes share key traits with archaea that distinguish both from bacteria. The core information machinery of eukaryotes more closely resembles that of archaea. The two domains share closely related components of the central DNA-RNA-protein machine: Even such hallmarks of eukaryotes as intragenic introns, why rRNA trees place archaea closer to eukaryotes than to Nevertheless, eukaryotes share fundamental structures with bacteria that differ from those in archaea. Archaea possess unique cell membrane components, such as their ether-linked lipids (see Chapter 19). Outside the archaea, ether-linked membrane lipids are found only in deepbranching bacterial species that share habitat (and exchange genes) with hyperthermophilic archaea. Only the domain Archaea includes species capable of growth in the most many other archaeal species grow well at mesophilic temperatures in soil or water. Perhaps the most striking distinction of archaea is the complete absence of archaeal pathogens of animals or plants. Even the many methanogens that live within animal digestive tracts have never been shown to cause disease. Overall, the three-domain phylogeny divides life usefully into three distinctive groups. Yet the tree also shows signs of gene flow unaccounted for by monophyletic descent. The eukaryotes contain mitochondria derived from assimilated bacteria whose genomes persist within the organelle. And genomes reveal evidence of gene transfer between bacteria and archaea sharing high-temperature habitats. What if the tree of life is not strictly monophyletic?"}

On the other hand, the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima shows a number of genes transferred from archaea. Between more closely related taxa, genes migrate even faster.

Some medically important genera, such as Neisseria (which causes gonorrhea and meningitis), are particularly \u201crecombinogenic.\u201d Rapid gene exchange enables pathogens to avoid the host immune system by expressing novel proteins not recognized by host antibodies. Furthermore, the genomes of eukaryotes include many genes acquired from bacteria, most of them from the endosymbiotic ancestors of their mitochondria and chloroplasts (discussed in Section 17.6). How does horizontal gene transfer affect microbial phylogeny? In 1999, Ford Doolittle, at Dalhousie University, redrew the standard tree of life with a bewildering array of cross-cutting lineages to show how actual phylogeny combines horizontal and vertical transfer (Fig. 17.22).

Operational genes function with relative independence from other cell components and consequently move more easily among distantly related organisms, particularly organisms that share the same habitat. An important category of such movable genes is virulence factors. Pathogens show extensive horizontal transfer of virulence genes and genes encoding resistance to host defenses and antibiotics. Groups of such genes are often transferred together on or nitrogen fixation (discussed in Section 9.6). Examples of a virulence plasmid and a genomic island are found in the cases, the group of genes transferred is so large that it makes up a substantial chunk of an organism\u2019s genome.

The two paralogous genes, or paralogs, have evolved to serve different functions. Paralogs are a major source of raw material that contributes to new functions arising through evolution. We can detect paralogs in a genome, through sequence relatedness; for example, the genome of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga cellobiose, mannose, and xylose, among others. Evolution of paralogs provides an important way for organisms to enhance fitness in a complex environment. Does a population ever lose some of its paralogs? Certain environments select for loss of many genes\u2014a phenomenon called degenerative, or reductive, evolution. The selection for loss is \u201cpositive\u201d because organisms save energy by avoiding replication and expression of unneeded genes. Intracellular pathogens and obligate symbionts often lose large chunks of their genome, by processes such as intracellular recombination of the chromosome. The lost genes typically encoded functions supplied by the host, such as capture of nutrients and generation of energy. Lost genes can be identified by comparison with free-living species. For example, Treponema pallidum, the cause of syphilis, has a genome of 1.1 million base pairs, which is about and amino acid biosynthesis. These genes remain in the genomes of free-living treponemes. In other species, dilute, nutrient-poor natural environments select for gene reduction. Marine cyanobacteria, a major source of global photosynthesis, have lost numerous genes that confer little advantage in the open ocean. Missing genes encode transporters for sugars and amino acids (which are scarce in the ocean) as well as proteins for flagellar motility and pili. More surprising, Prochlorococcus species have lost catalase, an enzyme that destroys the hydrogen peroxide they produce. Their hydrogen peroxide is detoxified by catalase-positive bacteria that share their marine habitat. Erik Zinser at the University of Tennessee\u2013 Knoxville showed that Prochlorococcus could be cultured on agar only in the presence of partner bacteria that supply catalase. Given that catalase is an expensive enzyme to produce, Prochlorococcus may have gained an advantage when this enzyme was deleted during its evolution in the nutrient-poor open ocean."}

{"id": 883, "text": "Classifying eukaryotes presents a challenge, for several reasons. Complex eukaryotic cells frequently lose structures through reductive (degenerative) evolution. Thus, for example, a clade originally defined by possession of flagella often includes members that lack flagella.

For example, the \u201cwater molds\u201d that grow on aquarium fish superficially resemble fungi, but they actually evolved in a clade that includes brown algae and diatoms. Another challenge for classification is the size and complexity of eukaryotic genomes, which has delayed the completion of genome sequences. Eukaryotic genomes are typically severalfold larger than those of bacteria and sequence and are more challenging to annotate than those of prokaryotes. Furthermore, the evolution of eukaryotes includes multiple events of endosymbiosis, in which an engulfed cell evolved into an essential organelle. An endosymbiotic incorporation of a proteobacterium by the ancestor of all eukaryotes gave rise to mitochondria.

Therefore, nitrogen-fixing bacteria generally isolate anaerobic nitrogen fixation from aerobic metabolism by one of several mechanisms, such as the heterocysts of cyanobacteria (also discussed in Chapter 15).

Several intriguing studies find that, even today, children who grow up on dairy farms are less likely to develop allergies and asthma.

Butyrate, however, seems to prevent obesity. It is used primarily by intestinal epithelial cells for energy and stimulates production of gut hormones that limit hunger. Butyrate also reduces the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferongamma (IFN-gamma), described in Sections 23.5 and 24.3.

For instance, Corynebacterium diphtheriae sensing a low iron environment will induce synthesis of diphtheria toxin (see eTopic 25.7; ). The toxin kills host cells to release their iron, which the bacteria can now use. For other pathogens, iron concentration alone is usually not enough to provoke virulence. Regulators sensitive to other in vivo signals must be activated to achieve a successful infection. Cell-cell communication is also important during infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for example, has at least two quorum-sensing systems that detect secreted autoinducers. As the number of bacteria in a given space increases, so, too, does the concentration of the chemical autoinducer. When the autoinducer reaches a critical concentration, it diffuses back into the bacterium or binds to a surface receptor and triggers the expression of bacterial target genes.

Capsules will envelop any C3b complement factor that binds to the bacterial surface, thereby hiding it from the phagocyte. Fortunately, immune defense mechanisms can eventually circumvent this avoidance strategy by producing opsonizing antibodies (IgG) against the capsule itself (see Section 24.2). The Fc regions of antibodies that bind to the capsule point away from the bacterium, so they are free to bind Fc receptors on phagocyte membranes.

Another immune avoidance strategy used by microorganisms, both the extracellular and intracellular types, is to change their antigenic structure. Genes encoding flagella, pili, and other surface proteins often use site-specific gene inversions to express alternative proteins (for example, Salmonella phase variation) or slipped-strand mispairing (see eTopic 10.1) to add or remove amino acids from a sequence (see Section 10.1).

Skin and soft-tissue infections range from simple boils to severe, complicated, so-called flesh-eating diseases that can be caused by a variety of bacteria, fungi, and viruses (see Table 26.1).

Successful lung pathogens come equipped with appropriate attachment mechanisms and countermeasures to avoid various lung defenses (such as alveolar macrophages). One reemerging bacterial pathogen, Bordetella pertussis, the cause of whooping cough, inhibits the mucociliary escalator by binding to lung cilia (eTopic 26.2). Although many microbes can infect the lung, most respiratory diseases are of viral origin, and most viral infections (such as the common cold) do not spread beyond the lung. Fortunately, viral diseases by and large are self-limiting and typically resolve within 2 weeks; however, the damage caused by a primary viral infection can lead to secondary infections by bacteria. Bacterial infections of the lung, whether of primary or secondary etiology, require intervention. Today this means antibiotic therapy. Before the advent of antibiotics, the only recourse was to insert a tube into the patient\u2019s back to drain fluid accumulating in the pleural cavity around the lung (a pathological process known as pleural effusion). Unless released, the pressure on the lung will collapse the alveoli and make breathing difficult. Viral infections predispose patients to secondary bacterial infections in several ways. Viral lung infections cause the patient to dehydrate, which increases mucus viscosity in the airways. Increased mucus viscosity limits motility of the mucociliary escalator (described in Section 23.1), making it harder to eliminate bacterial pathogens. To keep the escalator moving, cold sufferers are advised to drink plenty of fluids to decrease mucus viscosity. Another factor leading to secondary bacterial infections is that viruses can inhibit key aspects of lung innate-immune mechanisms that prevent bacterial growth.

As the infection spreads throughout the reproductive organs (uterus and fallopian tubes), pelvic inflammatory disease occurs (see earlier discussion of chlamydia). There is no serological test or vaccine for gonorrhea, because the organism frequently changes the structure of its surface antigens (phase variation is discussed in Section 10.1 and eTopic 10.1). owing to its sensitivity to complement, certain serum-resistant strains can make their way to the bloodstream and carry infection throughout the body.

There are pathogens that can directly infect the heart or the endothelial cells lining blood vessels. However, the blood itself can also become infected or serve as a mass transit system to spread pathogens throughout the body. Pathogens disseminated in this way can cause infections in many different organ systems. We will examine both types of infections in this section. Infections of the cardiovascular system include septicemia, endocarditis (inflammation of the heart\u2019s inner lining), pericarditis (inflammation of the heart\u2019s outer lining), myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscle), and, possibly, atherosclerosis (deposition of fatty substances along the inner lining of arteries; eTopic 26.6).

In the erythrocytic cycle, the organisms enter the bloodstream through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito (the mosquito injects a small amount of saliva containing Plasmodium). The haploid sporozoites travel immediately to the liver, where they undergo asexual fission to produce merozoites. Released from the liver, the merozoites attach to and penetrate red blood cells, where Plasmodium consumes hemoglobin and enlarges into a trophozoite. The protist nucleus divides, so that the cell, now called a schizont, contains up to 20 or so nuclei. The schizont then divides to make the smaller, haploid merozoites releasing merozoites that can infect new red blood cells (see Fig. 20.39).

The chloroquine family of drugs acts by interfering with the detoxification of heme generated from hemoglobin digestion. Malaria parasites accumulate the hemoglobin released from red blood cells in plasmodial lysosomes, where digestion occurs. The parasites use the amino acids from hemoglobin to grow but find free heme toxic. To prevent eating itself to death (from accumulating too much heme), the organism detoxifies heme via polymerization, which produces a black pigment. Many antimalarial drugs, such as chloroquine, prevent polymerization by binding to the heme. As a result, the increased iron level (from heme) kills the parasite.

Clostridium tetani spores are introduced into the body by trauma (such as by stepping on the wrong end of a nail). Necrotic tissue then provides the anaerobic environment required for germination.

Gene transfer mechanisms such as conjugation, described in Chapter 9, can move antibiotic resistance genes from one organism to another and from one species to another. In fact, several drug resistance genes found in pathogenic bacteria actually had their start in the chromosomes of the drug-producing organisms and were passed on through gene swapping. For instance, Streptomyces clavuligerus produces a beta-lactamase (encoded by the bla gene) that protects this organism from the penicillin it produces. Transfer of a drug resistance gene is particularly evident if the gene has been incorporated into a plasmid and that plasmid is found in a new species.

Persistence is a long-recognized mystery of microbiology.

These persisters were not mutants made permanently resistant through mutation. They acted as though dormant.

Understanding which antibiotics are effective in treating an infectious agent will help the physician avoid prescribing an inappropriate drug. Furthermore, knowing which drugs are ineffective enables health organizations to track the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains.

Remember, too, that viral pathogens are not susceptible to antibiotics, so knowing that a patient has a viral disease can prevent the inappropriate use of antibiotics. Pathogen-specific disease complications. Many diseases have serious complications that are common to a given organism or strain of organism. For example, children whose sore throats are caused by certain strains of Streptococcus pyogenes can develop serious complications affecting the heart and kidney long after the infection has resolved. These complications are the immunological consequence of bacterial and host antigen cross-reactivity; they are called sequelae (singular, sequela) because they occur after the infection itself is over.

The deadly plume drifted downwind, infecting humans and cattle across a wide area. The resulting anthrax outbreak ultimately killed more than 64 people. Had a rapid pathogen detection system been available and deployed at the facility, all those lives could have been saved. Unfortunately, 30 years ago such technology was only the stuff of science fiction. Today, that technology exists in small, portable forms. Several multipathogen molecular detection platforms have specific pathogen genes and detect the products through hybridization to immobilized oligonucleotides. The wet chemistries for all of these detection systems are carried out in a roughly 2-inch square called lab-on-a-chip. device was developed in 2008. BioFlash-E can detect and identify a pathogen in as little as 3 minutes\u2014significantly faster than traditional methods requiring isolation and growth of the pathogen (which can take 48 hours or longer). The sensor Analysis and Notification of Antigen Risks and Yields) that can detect as few as a dozen particles of a pathogen per liter of air. Currently, it can detect 24 pathogens, including the potential bioterrorism agents of anthrax, plague, smallpox, and tularemia. \n\nBorders was quoted as saying: \u201cThe quicker we can contain this the fewer cases we\u2019ll have, then the smaller the scale of the epidemic. That\u2019s the idea of going in as strong as we can early on.\u201d We now know that this report represented the leading edge of the horrific Ebola epidemic that ravaged West Africa. As a fledgling microbiologist, tracking these ProMED reports allows you to see epidemics and new diseases emerge almost in real time. \n\n28.10 On the ProMED-mail web page (www.promedmail. org), click on the interactive world map to view outbreaks world during the current year? \n\n2. B-cell antibodies bind to the agent. \n\n5. Photons released hit the photon detector. \n\nprimers that their system uses to amplify indicator genes of over 20 potential biowarfare agents. Discuss why this decision to publish was either good or bad. \n\nSometimes world and national health organizations quickly and efficiently identify and contain outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, as was the case in 2003 with severe instances, outbreaks take more time to contain, such as the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, described earlier. Agencies can also face difficulties in clearly identifying the causative agent of an outbreak, as in the current 2015\u201316 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil. The unfolding Zika virus story provides an instructive example of how new diseases are identified. \n\nOne 7:e36528. \n\nis now endemic to Brazil. There is no treatment for Zika fever, although furious efforts are under way to develop a vaccine. At the moment, the only protection against Zika is to prevent infection by avoiding or eradicating the Aedes So, have Koch\u2019s postulates been fulfilled? Does Zika virus infection of the mother lead to transplacental transmission of the virus to the fetus? And does virus replication interfere with fetal brain development? Evidence of the virus has been found in the blood of mothers who have delivered babies with microcephaly, and also in umbilical cord blood. The virus itself has been isolated from the brains of fetuses who died from microcephaly (see the Current Research Highlight in Chapter 26). Other studies have recapitulated the neurotropic nature of the virus and indicate that Zika virus can interfere with neurogenesis during human brain development. In sum, the evidence of a link is convincing but not yet ironclad. More epidemiological studies must be conducted to unequivocally prove the link. As of this writing, at least 1,000 babies in Brazil have been born with microcephaly and other birth defects linked to Zika virus. But it is important to point out that despite the fear Zika virus brings to pregnant women, the vast majority of confirmed Zika virus\u2013infected pregnant Zika virus throughout the Americas by intensively screening mosquitoes. \n\nLyme disease. Suburban development in the northeastern United States destroys predators of the mice that carry Borrelia burgdorferi. \n\nNatural environmental events can also trigger upsurges in the incidence of unusual diseases. For example, an unprecedented outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary disease occurred in 1993 in the Four Corners area of the Southwest, where Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah meet, when rain led to greater-than-normal increases in plant and animal numbers. The resulting tenfold increase in deer mice, which carries the virus, made it more likely that recent outbreak of hantavirus occurred among campers at Yosemite National Park in 2012. \n\ndemographics that can affect disease patterns, degradation in the quality and availability of both drinking water and food, and changes in animal and plant species health. Climate change will continue to create opportunities for some pathogens and may even limit the transmission of others. To stay ahead of these evolving infections, surveillance programs capable of detecting pathogen or disease emergence are essential. Make no mistake: Together, the effect of climate change on infectious diseases and the rise in antibiotic-resistant microbes pose a serious threat to the living world. \n\nditches close to the spinach fields in the area. Scientists pondering these facts within the One Health framework a field, thereby contaminating wild hogs. The wild hogs, by running through the spinach fields, had contaminated those fields with their feces, and the irrigation water had then swept the pathogen into the plant vasculature. Only by integrating our knowledge of the environment and ecology could this investigation be completely understood and appropriate intervention and prevention strategies implemented. This outbreak exemplifies the fact that human health and animal health are inextricably linked and that a holistic approach is needed to understand, protect, and promote the health of all species. \n\nthe One Health approach is being carried out in the Ruaha region of Tanzania, Africa\u2014a sprawling, wild area with scattered small villages and a rich wildlife. Thousands of children and adults in underdeveloped countries such as Tanzania die every day from diseases arising from the human-animal-environment interface. People in these areas often live in close contact with wild and domestic animals and are brought even closer as water becomes scarcer (Fig. 28.29). Sharing the same water sources for drinking, washing, and swimming facilitates zoonotic disease transmission to humans. \n\nillustrates the close relationship that some residents of Tanzania have with their livestock, and the opportunities by which zoonotic infections can be transmitted to humans."}
