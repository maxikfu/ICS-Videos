1.20125 By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the evidence for Maxwell’s electromagnetic model of light Describe the relationship between wavelength, frequency, and speed of light Discuss the particle model of light and the definition of photon Explain how and why the amount of light we see from an object depends upon its distance Coded into the light and other kinds of radiation that reach us from objects in the universe is a wide range of information about what those objects are like and how they work.
0.5453846153846154 If we can decipher this code and read the messages it contains, we can learn an enormous amount about the cosmos without ever having to leave Earth or its immediate environment.
1.3966666666666667 The visible light and other radiation we receive from the stars and planets is generated by processes at the atomic level—by changes in the way the parts of an atom interact and move.
0.7266666666666666 Thus, to appreciate how light is generated, we must explore how atoms work.
0.8200000000000001 There is a bit of irony in the fact that in order to understand some of the largest structures in the universe, we must become acquainted with some of the smallest.
0.8900000000000001 Notice that we have twice used the phrase “light and other radiation.
0.6433333333333334 One of the key ideas explored in this chapter is that visible light is not unique; it is merely the most familiar example of a much larger family of radiation that can carry information to us.
0.47 The word “ radiation” will be used frequently in this book, so it is important to understand what it means.
0.9376923076923077 In everyday language, “radiation” is often used to describe certain kinds of energetic subatomic particles released by radioactive materials in our environment.
0.6100000000000001 (An example is the kind of radiation used to treat some cancers.)
0.7933333333333332 But this is not what we mean when we use the word “radiation” in an astronomy text.
0.92 Radiation, as used in this book, is a general term for waves (including light waves) that radiate outward from a source.
1.8100000000000003 As we saw in Orbits and Gravity, Newton’s theory of gravity accounts for the motions of planets as well as objects on Earth.
0.5122222222222222 Application of this theory to a variety of problems dominated the work of scientists for nearly two centuries.
1.1099999999999999 In the nineteenth century, many physicists turned to the study of electricity and magnetism, which are intimately connected with the production of light.
0.7244444444444443 The scientist who played a role in this field comparable to Newton’s role in the study of gravity was physicist James Clerk Maxwell, born and educated in Scotland (Figure 5.2).
0.86 Inspired by a number of ingenious experiments that showed an intimate relationship between electricity and magnetism, Maxwell developed a theory that describes both electricity and magnetism with only a small number of elegant equations.
1.17 It is this theory that gives us important insights into the nature and behavior of light.
1.1082608695652174 By the end of this section, you will be able to: Understand the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and how they differ from one another Understand how each part of the spectrum interacts with Earth’s atmosphere Explain how and why the light emitted by an object depends on its temperature Objects in the universe send out an enormous range of electromagnetic radiation.
0.9557142857142856 Scientists call this range the electromagnetic spectrum, which they have divided into a number of categories.
0.9744444444444444 We will look at the structure of the atom in more detail later, but we begin by noting that the typical atom consists of several types of particles, a number of which have not only mass but an additional property called electric charge.
1.3455555555555558 In the nucleus (central part) of every atom are protons, which are positively charged; outside the nucleus are electrons, which have a negative charge.
0.9344444444444443 Maxwell’s theory deals with these electric charges and their effects, especially when they are moving.
1.01 In the vicinity of an electron charge, another charge feels a force of attraction or repulsion: opposite charges attract; like charges repel.
0.5433333333333333 When charges are not in motion, we observe only this electric attraction or repulsion.
0.61 If charges are in motion, however (as they are inside every atom and in a wire carrying a current), then we measure another force called magnetism.
0.7788888888888889 Magnetism was well known for much of recorded human history, but its cause was not understood until the nineteenth century.
0.305 Experiments with electric charges demonstrated that magnetism was the result of moving charged particles.
0.49857142857142855 Sometimes, the motion is clear, as in the coils of heavy wire that make an industrial electromagnet.
0.6522222222222223 Other times, it is more subtle, as in the kind of magnet you buy in a hardware store, in which many of the electrons inside the atoms are spinning in roughly the same direction; it is the alignment of their motion that causes the material to become magnetic.
0.36000000000000004 Physicists use the word field to describe the action of forces that one object exerts on other distant objects.
1.07 For example, we say the Sun produces a gravitational field that controls Earth’s orbit, even though the Sun and Earth do not come directly into contact.
0.305 Using this terminology, we can say that stationary electric charges produce electric fields, and moving electric charges also produce magnetic fields.
0.7266666666666666 Actually, the relationship between electric and magnetic phenomena is even more profound.
0.5122222222222222 Experiments showed that changing magnetic fields could produce electric currents (and thus changing electric fields), and changing electric currents could in turn produce changing magnetic fields.
0.44142857142857145 So once begun, electric and magnetic field changes could continue to trigger each other.
0.49666666666666665 Maxwell analyzed what would happen if electric charges were oscillating (moving constantly back and forth) and found that the resulting pattern of electric and magnetic fields would spread out and travel rapidly through space.
0.32333333333333336 Something similar happens when a raindrop strikes the surface of water or a frog jumps into a pond.
0.4566666666666667 The disturbance moves outward and creates a pattern we call a wave in the water (Figure 5.3).
0.5271428571428571 You might, at first, think that there must be very few situations in nature where electric charges oscillate, but this is not at all the case.
1.1122222222222222 As we shall see, atoms and molecules (which consist of charged particles) oscillate back and forth all the time.
1.2600000000000002 The resulting electromagnetic disturbances are among the most common phenomena in the universe.
0.6761538461538461 Maxwell was able to calculate the speed at which an electromagnetic disturbance moves through space; he found that it is equal to the speed of light, which had been measured experimentally.
0.9042857142857142 On that basis, he speculated that light was one form of a family of possible electromagnetic disturbances called electromagnetic radiation, a conclusion that was again confirmed in laboratory experiments.
0.6449999999999999 When light (reflected from the pages of an astronomy textbook, for example) enters a human eye, its changing electric and magnetic fields stimulate nerve endings, which then transmit the information contained in these changing fields to the brain.
1.278888888888889 The science of astronomy is primarily about analyzing radiation from distant objects to understand what they are and how they work.
0.5736363636363636 The changing electric and magnetic fields in light are similar to the waves that can be set up in a quiet pool of water.
1.0530769230769232 In both cases, the disturbance travels rapidly outward from the point of origin and can use its energy to disturb other things farther away.
0.35307692307692307 (For example, in water, the expanding ripples moving away from our frog could disturb the peace of a dragonfly resting on a leaf in the same pool.)
0.666 In the case of electromagnetic waves, the radiation generated by a transmitting antenna full of charged particles and moving electrons at your local radio station can, sometime later, disturb a group of electrons in your car radio antenna and bring you the news and weather while you are driving to class or work in the morning.
0.6799999999999999 The waves generated by charged particles differ from water waves in some profound ways, however.
0.6344444444444445 The sound waves we hear, to give another example, are pressure disturbances that require air to travel though.
0.62 But electromagnetic waves do not require water or air: the fields generate each other and so can move through a vacuum (such as outer space).
0.3372727272727273 This was such a disturbing idea to nineteenthcentury scientists that they actually made up a substance to fill all of space—one for which there was not a single shred of evidence
1.17 —just so light waves could have something to travel through: they called it the aether.
0.5684615384615386 Today, we know that there is no aether and that electromagnetic waves have no trouble at all moving through empty space (as all the starlight visible on a clear night must surely be doing).
0.729090909090909 The other difference is that all electromagnetic waves move at the same speed in empty space (the speed of light—approximately 300,000 kilometers per second, or 300,000,000 meters per second, which can also be written as 3 × 108 m/s), which turns out to be the fastest possible speed in the universe.
0.9677777777777777 No matter where electromagnetic waves are generated from and no matter what other properties they have, when they are moving (and not interacting with matter), they move at the speed of light.
0.51 Yet you know from everyday experience that there are different kinds of light.
0.927142857142857 For example, we perceive that light waves differ from one another in a property we call color.
1.13 Let’s see how we can denote the differences among the whole broad family of electromagnetic waves.
0.5700000000000001 The nice thing about a wave is that it is a repeating phenomenon.
1.3453846153846154 Whether it is the up-and-down motion of a water wave or the changing electric and magnetic fields in a wave of light, the pattern of disturbance repeats in a cyclical way.
0.705 Thus, any wave motion can be characterized by a series of crests and troughs (Figure 5.4).
0.81 Moving from one crest through a trough to the next crest completes one cycle.
0.7599999999999999 The horizontal length covered by one cycle is called the wavelength.
0.8455555555555555 Ocean waves provide an analogy: the wavelength is the distance that separates successive wave crests.
0.6616666666666667 For visible light, our eyes perceive different wavelengths as different colors: red, for example, is the longest visible wavelength, and violet is the shortest.
1.0666914230605034 The main colors of visible light from longest to shortest wavelength can be remembered using the mnemonic ROY G BIV—for Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, and Violet.
1.2128571428571429 Other invisible forms of electromagnetic radiation have different wavelengths, as we will see in the next section.
0.8925 We can also characterize different waves by their frequency, the number of wave cycles that pass by per second.
0.3011111111111111 If you count 10 crests moving by each second, for example, then the frequency is 10 cycles per second (cps).
0.69 In honor of Heinrich Hertz, the physicist who—inspired by Maxwell’s work—discovered radio waves, a cps is also called a hertz (Hz).
0.5405882352941177 Take a look at your radio, for example, and you will see the channel assigned to each radio station is characterized by its frequency, usually in units of KHz (kilohertz, or thousands of hertz) or MHz (megahertz, or millions of hertz).
0.7788888888888889 Wavelength (λ) and frequency (f) are related because all electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed.
0.3011111111111111 To see how this works, imagine a parade in which everyone is forced by prevailing traffic conditions to move at exactly the same speed.
1.01 You stand on a corner and watch the waves of marchers come by.
0.44999999999999996 Because they are not very large and, therefore, have a shorter wavelength, a good number of the ponies can move past you each minute; we can say they have a high frequency.
0.34750000000000003 The elephants are large and marching at the same speed as the ponies, so far fewer of them can march past you per minute: Because they have a wider spacing (longer wavelength), they represent a lower frequency.
0.8866666666666667 The formula for this relationship can be expressed as follows: for any wave motion, the speed at which a wave moves equals the frequency times the wavelength.
1.07 Waves with longer wavelengths have lower frequencies.
0.47571428571428576 This answer can also be written as 530 nm, which is in the yellow-green part of the visible spectrum (nm stands for nanometers, where the term “nano” means “billionths”).
0.927142857142857 ” or tsunamis, are waves caused by earthquakes that travel rapidly through the ocean.
1.3225 If a tsunami travels at the speed of 600 km/h and approaches a shore at a rate of one wave crest every 15 min (4 waves/h), what would be the distance between those wave crests at sea?
1.6463636363636363 The electromagnetic wave model of light (as formulated by Maxwell) was one of the great triumphs of nineteenth-century science.
0.6426315789473684 In 1887, when Heinrich Hertz actually made invisible electromagnetic waves (what today are called radio waves) on one side of a room and detected them on the other side, it ushered in a new era that led to the modern age of telecommunications.
0.9783333333333333 His experiment ultimately led to the technologies of television, cell phones, and today’s wireless networks around the globe.
0.5684615384615386 However, by the beginning of the twentieth century, more sophisticated experiments had revealed that light behaves in certain ways that cannot be explained by the wave model.
0.8366666666666667 Reluctantly, physicists had to accept that sometimes light behaves more like a “particle”—or at least a self-contained packet of energy—than a wave.
0.8827272727272727 The fact that light behaves like a wave in certain experiments and like a particle in others was a very surprising and unlikely idea.
0.49857142857142855 After all, our common sense says that waves and particles are opposite concepts.
0.7414285714285714 On one hand, a wave is a repeating disturbance that, by its very nature, is not in only one place, but spreads out.
0.65 A particle, on the other hand, is something that can be in only one place at any given time.
1.0533333333333332 Strange as it sounds, though, countless experiments now confirm that electromagnetic radiation can sometimes behave like a wave and at other times like a particle.
0.6838461538461538 Then, again, perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised that something that always travels at the “speed limit” of the universe and doesn’t need a medium to travel through might not obey our everyday common sense ideas.
0.81 The confusion that this wave-particle duality of light caused in physics was eventually resolved by the introduction of a more complicated theory of waves and particles, now called quantum mechanics.
0.5433333333333333 (This is one of the most interesting fields of modern science, but it is mostly beyond the scope of our book.
0.27 If you are interested in it, see some of the suggested resources at the end of this chapter.)
0.9042857142857142 In any case, you should now be prepared when scientists (or the authors of this book) sometimes discuss electromagnetic radiation as if it consisted of waves and at other times refer to it as a stream of photons.
1.75 A photon (being a packet of energy) carries a specific amount of energy.
1.4271428571428573 We can use the idea of energy to connect the photon and wave models.
1.5433333333333334 How much energy a photon has depends on its frequency when you think about it as a wave.
1.7463636363636363 A low-energy radio wave has a low frequency as a wave, while a high-energy X-ray at your dentist’s office is a high-frequency wave.
2.0677777777777777 Among the colors of visible light, violet-light photons have the highest energy and red-light photons have the lowest.
1.4100000000000001 Test whether the connection between photons and waves is clear to you.
0.9424999999999999 In the above example, which photon would have the longer wavelength as a wave: the radio wave or the X-ray?
0.6788888888888889 Radio waves have a lower frequency, so the wave cycles are longer (they are elephants, not miniature ponies).
0.9674999999999999 Let’s think for a moment about how light from a lightbulb moves through space.
1.2128571428571429 As waves expand, they travel away from the bulb, not just toward your eyes but in all directions.
1.2128571428571429 Yet the total amount of light available can’t change once the light has left the bulb.
0.4455555555555556 This means that, as the same expanding shell of light covers a larger and larger area, there must be less and less of it in any given place.
0.8985714285714285 Light (and all other electromagnetic radiation) gets weaker and weaker as it gets farther from its source.
0.7799999999999999 The increase in the area that the light must cover is proportional to the square of the distance that the light has traveled (Figure 5.5).
0.5736363636363636 If we stand twice as far from the source, our eyes will intercept two-squared (2 × 2), or four times less light.
0.8424999999999999 If we stand 10 times farther from the source, we get 10-squared, or 100 times less light.
0.5271428571428571 You can see how this weakening means trouble for sources of light at astronomical distances.
1.3800000000000001 One of the nearest stars, Alpha Centauri A, emits about the same total energy as the Sun.
0.6299999999999999 But it is about 270,000 times farther away, and so it appears about 73 billion times fainter.
1.3554545454545455 No wonder the stars, which close-up would look more or less like the Sun, look like faint pinpoints of light from far away.
1.26 Electromagnetic radiation with the shortest wavelengths, no longer than 0.01 nanometer, is categorized as gamma rays (1 nanometer = 10–9 meters; see Appendix D).
1.2185714285714284 The name gamma comes from the third letter of the Greek alphabet: gamma rays were the third kind of radiation discovered coming from radioactive atoms when physicists first investigated their behavior.
0.5175000000000001 Because gamma rays carry a lot of energy, they can be dangerous for living tissues.
0.7223076923076923 Gamma radiation is generated deep in the interior of stars, as well as by some of the most violent phenomena in the universe, such as the deaths of stars and the merging of stellar corpses.
0.46142857142857147 Gamma rays coming to Earth are absorbed by our atmosphere before they reach the ground (which is a good thing for our health); thus, they can only be studied using instruments in space.
1.18 Electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths between 0.01 nanometer and 20 nanometers is referred to as Xrays.
0.4614285714285714 Being more energetic than visible light, X-rays are able to penetrate soft tissues but not bones, and so allow us to make images of the shadows of the bones inside us.
0.7500000000000001 While X-rays can penetrate a short length of human flesh, they are stopped by the large numbers of atoms in Earth’s atmosphere with which they interact.
0.73 Thus, X-ray astronomy (like gamma-ray astronomy) could not develop until we invented ways of sending instruments above our atmosphere (Figure 5.7).
0.5700000000000001 Figure 5.7 X-Ray Sky.
0.8736363636363635 This is a map of the sky tuned to certain types of X-rays (seen from above Earth’s atmosphere).
0.4788888888888889 The map tilts the sky so that the disk of our Milky Way Galaxy runs across its center.
0.3792879441171442 It was constructed and artificially colored from data gathered by the European ROSAT satellite.
1.1 Each color (red, yellow, and blue) shows X-rays of different frequencies or energies.
0.33769230769230774 For example, red outlines the glow from a hot local bubble of gas all around us, blown by one or more exploding stars in our cosmic vicinity.
0.4685714285714285 Yellow and blue show more distant sources of X-rays, such as remnants of other exploded stars or the active center of our Galaxy (in the middle of the picture).
1.2281818181818183 Radiation intermediate between X-rays and visible light is ultraviolet (meaning higher energy than violet).
0.8674999999999999 Outside the world of science, ultraviolet light is sometimes called “black light” because our eyes cannot see it.
0.7109090909090908 Ultraviolet radiation is mostly blocked by the ozone layer of Earth’s atmosphere, but a small fraction of ultraviolet rays from our Sun do penetrate to cause sunburn or, in extreme cases of overexposure, skin cancer in human beings.
0.74 Electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths between roughly 400 and 700 nm is called visible light because these are the waves that human vision can perceive.
1.0174999999999998 This is also the band of the electromagnetic spectrum that most readily reaches Earth’s surface.
0.5900000000000001 These two observations are not coincidental: human eyes evolved to see the kinds of waves that arrive from the Sun most effectively.
0.6699999999999999 Earth’s atmosphere effectively, except when it is temporarily blocked by clouds.
1.3925 Between visible light and radio waves are the wavelengths of infrared or heat radiation.
1.0328571428571427 Astronomer William Herschel first discovered infrared in 1800 while trying to measure the temperatures of different colors of sunlight spread out into a spectrum.
0.745 He noticed that when he accidently positioned his thermometer beyond the reddest color, it still registered heating due to some invisible energy coming from the Sun.
0.6566666666666666 This was the first hint about the existence of the other (invisible) bands of the electromagnetic spectrum, although it would take many decades for our full understanding to develop.
0.745 A heat lamp radiates mostly infrared radiation, and the nerve endings in our skin are sensitive to this band of the electromagnetic spectrum.
0.7033333333333333 Infrared waves are absorbed by water and carbon dioxide molecules, which are more concentrated low in Earth’s atmosphere.
0.4677777777777778 For this reason, infrared astronomy is best done from high mountaintops, high-flying airplanes, and spacecraft.
1.0175 After infrared comes the familiar microwave, used in short-wave communication and microwave ovens.
0.33666666666666667 (Wavelengths vary from 1 millimeter to 1 meter and are absorbed by water vapor, which makes them effective in heating foods.)
0.64 The “micro-” prefix refers to the fact that microwaves are small in comparison to radio waves, the next on the spectrum.
0.3685714285714286 You may remember that tea—which is full of water—heats up quickly in your microwave oven, while a ceramic cup—from which water has been removed by baking—stays cool in comparison.
0.7281818181818182 All electromagnetic waves longer than microwaves are called radio waves, but this is so broad a category that we generally divide it into several subsections.
0.5984546107838109 Among the most familiar of these are radar waves, which are used in radar guns by traffic officers to determine vehicle speeds, and AM radio waves, which were the first to be developed for broadcasting.
0.53 The wavelengths of these different categories range from over a meter to hundreds of meters, and other radio radiation can have wavelengths as long as several kilometers.
0.7799999999999999 With such a wide range of wavelengths, not all radio waves interact with Earth’s atmosphere in the same way.
0.6353593726885728 FM and TV waves are not absorbed and can travel easily through our atmosphere.
0.7303173558818502 AM radio waves are absorbed or reflected by a layer in Earth’s atmosphere called the ionosphere (the ionosphere is a layer of charged particles at the top of our atmosphere, produced by interactions with sunlight and charged particles that are ejected from the Sun).
1.0005263157894735 We hope this brief survey has left you with one strong impression: although visible light is what most people associate with astronomy, the light that our eyes can see is only a tiny fraction of the broad range of waves generated in the universe.
0.5828571428571429 Today, we understand that judging some astronomical phenomenon by using only the light we can see is like hiding under the table at a big dinner party and judging all the guests by nothing but their shoes.
0.29333333333333333 There’s a lot more to each person than meets our eye under the table.
0.8689473684210526 It is very important for those who study astronomy today to avoid being “visible light chauvinists”—to respect only the information seen by their eyes while ignoring the information gathered by instruments sensitive to other bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.
0.8757142857142857 Table 5.1 summarizes the bands of the electromagnetic spectrum and indicates the temperatures and typical astronomical objects that emit each kind of electromagnetic radiation.
0.7499999999999999 While at first, some of the types of radiation listed in the table may seem unfamiliar, you will get to know them better as your astronomy course continues.
0.7128571428571429 You can return to this table as you learn more about the types of objects astronomers study.
0.9175 Some astronomical objects emit mostly infrared radiation, others mostly visible light, and still others mostly ultraviolet radiation.
1.3900000000000003 What determines the type of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the Sun, stars, and other dense astronomical objects?
0.5918181818181818 A solid is composed of molecules and atoms in continuous vibration: they move back and forth in place, but their motion is much too small for our eyes to make out.
0.43285714285714283 A gas consists of atoms and/or molecules that are flying about freely at high speed, continually bumping into one another and bombarding the surrounding matter.
0.7414285714285714 The hotter the solid or gas, the more rapid the motion of its molecules or atoms.
1.1099999999999999 The temperature of something is thus a measure of the average motion energy of the particles that make it up.
1.4175000000000002 This motion at the microscopic level is responsible for much of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth and in the universe.
1.3675000000000002 As atoms and molecules move about and collide, or vibrate in place, their electrons give off electromagnetic radiation.
1.3266666666666669 The characteristics of this radiation are determined by the temperature of those atoms and molecules.
0.4376923076923077 In a hot material, for example, the individual particles vibrate in place or move rapidly from collisions, so the emitted waves are, on average, more energetic.
1.17 And recall that higher energy waves have a higher frequency.
1.0699999999999998 In very cool material, the particles have low-energy atomic and molecular motions and thus generate lower-energy waves.
1.195 To understand, in more quantitative detail, the relationship between temperature and electromagnetic radiation, we imagine an idealized object called a blackbody.
0.8757142857142857 Such an object (unlike your sweater or your astronomy instructor’s head) does not reflect or scatter any radiation, but absorbs all the electromagnetic energy that falls onto it.
0.6549999999999999 The energy that is absorbed causes the atoms and molecules in it to vibrate or move around at increasing speeds.
0.8011111111111111 As it gets hotter, this object will radiate electromagnetic waves until absorption and radiation are in balance.
0.255 We want to discuss such an idealized object because, as you will see, stars behave in very nearly the same way.
0.7766666666666666 The radiation from a blackbody has several characteristics, as illustrated in Figure 5.8.
1.18 The graph shows the power emitted at each wavelength by objects of different temperatures.
1.0542857142857143 In science, the word power means the energy coming off per second (and it is typically measured in watts, which you are probably familiar with from buying lightbulbs).
0.55 Figure 5.8 Radiation Laws Illustrated.
0.92 This graph shows in arbitrary units how many photons are given off at each wavelength for objects at four different temperatures.
1.1842857142857142 The wavelengths corresponding to visible light are shown by the colored bands.
0.8674999999999999 Note that at hotter temperatures, more energy (in the form of photons) is emitted at all wavelengths.
0.8736363636363635 The higher the temperature, the shorter the wavelength at which the peak amount of energy is radiated (this is known as Wien’s law).
0.9600000000000001 First of all, notice that the curves show that, at each temperature, our blackbody object emits radiation (photons) at all wavelengths (all colors).
0.44999999999999996 This is because in any solid or denser gas, some molecules or atoms vibrate or move between collisions slower than average and some move faster than average.
0.9 So when we look at the electromagnetic waves emitted, we find a broad range, or spectrum, of energies and wavelengths.
1.1328571428571428 More energy is emitted at the average vibration or motion rate (the highest part of each curve), but if we have a large number of atoms or molecules, some energy will be detected at each wavelength.
0.4677777777777778 Second, note that an object at a higher temperature emits more power at all wavelengths than does a cooler one.
0.63 In a hot gas (the taller curves in Figure 5.8), for example, the atoms have more collisions and give off more energy.
0.5175000000000001 In the real world of stars, this means that hotter stars give off more energy at every wavelength than do cooler stars.
0.6122222222222222 Third, the graph shows us that the higher the temperature, the shorter the wavelength at which the maximum power is emitted.
0.47 Remember that a shorter wavelength means a higher frequency and energy.
0.61 It makes sense, then, that hot objects give off a larger fraction of their energy at shorter wavelengths (higher energies) than do cool objects.
0.27 You may have observed examples of this rule in everyday life.
1.0533333333333332 When a burner on an electric stove is turned on low, it emits only heat, which is infrared radiation, but does not glow with visible light.
0.9424999999999999 If the burner is set to a higher temperature, it starts to glow a dull red.
0.7549999999999999 At a still-higher setting, it glows a brighter orange-red (shorter wavelength).
0.9009090909090909 At even higher temperatures, which cannot be reached with ordinary stoves, metal can appear brilliant yellow or even blue-white.
0.4677777777777778 We can use these ideas to come up with a rough sort of “thermometer” for measuring the temperatures of stars.
1.2554545454545454 Because many stars give off most of their energy in visible light, the color of light that dominates a star’s appearance is a rough indicator of its temperature.
0.9766666666666666 If one star looks red and another looks blue, which one has the higher temperature?
0.2842857142857143 Because blue is the shorter-wavelength color, it is the sign of a hotter star.
0.6344444444444445 (Note that the temperatures we associate with different colors in science are not the same as the ones artists use.
0.7842857142857143 In art, red is often called a “hot” color and blue a “cool” color.
1.07 Likewise, we commonly see red on faucet or air conditioning controls to indicate hot temperatures and blue to indicate cold temperatures.
0.49857142857142855 Although these are common uses to us in daily life, in nature, it’s the other way around.)
0.5607692307692308 We can develop a more precise star thermometer by measuring how much energy a star gives off at each wavelength and by constructing diagrams like Figure 5.8.
1.0425 The location of the peak (or maximum) in the power curve of each star can tell us its temperature.
0.7196450869742871 The average temperature at the surface of the Sun, which is where the radiation that we see is emitted, turns out to be 5800 K. (Throughout this text, we use the kelvin or absolute temperature scale.
0.4524787068367864 On this scale, water freezes at 273 K and boils at 373 K. All molecular motion ceases at 0 K. The various temperature scales are described in Appendix D.)
1.0542857142857143 Since this star has a peak wavelength that is at a shorter wavelength (in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum) than that of our Sun (in the visible part of the spectrum), it should come as no surprise that its surface temperature is much hotter than our Sun’s.
0.3011111111111111 We can also describe our observation that hotter objects radiate more power at all wavelengths in a mathematical form.
1.25 If we sum up the contributions from all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, we obtain the total energy emitted by a blackbody.
1.07 What we usually measure from a large object like a star is the energy flux, the power emitted per square meter.
0.53 The word flux means “flow” here: we are interested in the flow of power into an area (like the area of a telescope mirror).
0.7799999999999999 It turns out that the energy flux from a blackbody at temperature T is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature.
0.6290909090909091 This relationship is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann law and can be written in the form of an equation as where F stands for the energy flux and σ (Greek letter sigma) is a constant number (5.67 × 10-8).
1.2128571428571429 Increasing the temperature of a star would have a tremendous effect on the power it radiates.
0.6985714285714285 If the Sun, for example, were twice as hot—that is, if it had a temperature of 11,600 K
1.03 —it would radiate 24, or 16 times more power than it does now.
1.2128571428571429 Tripling the temperature would raise the power output 81 times.
1.01 Hot stars really shine away a tremendous amount of energy.
0.6549999999999999 Light exhibits certain behaviors that are important to the design of telescopes and other instruments.
0.9616666666666667 If the surface is smooth and shiny, as with a mirror, the direction of the reflected light beam can be calculated accurately from knowledge of the shape of the reflecting surface.
0.49 Light is also bent, or refracted, when it passes from one kind of transparent material into another—say, from the air into a glass lens.
0.56 Reflection and refraction of light are the basic properties that make possible all optical instruments (devices that help us to see things better)—from eyeglasses to giant astronomical telescopes.
1.0833333333333335 Such instruments are generally combinations of glass lenses, which bend light according to the principles of refraction, and curved mirrors, which depend on the properties of reflection.
0.3433333333333333 Small optical devices, such as eyeglasses or binoculars, generally use lenses, whereas large telescopes depend almost entirely on mirrors for their main optical elements.
0.7599999999999999 We will discuss astronomical instruments and their uses more fully in Astronomical Instruments.
1.2499999999999998 For now, we turn to another behavior of light, one that is essential for the decoding of light.
0.4475 In 1672, in the first paper that he submitted to the Royal Society, Sir Isaac Newton described an experiment in which he permitted sunlight to pass through a small hole and then through a prism.
0.4372727272727273 Newton found that sunlight, which looks white to us, is actually made up of a mixture of all the colors of the rainbow (Figure 5.9).
0.845 When Newton described the laws of refraction and dispersion in optics, and observed the solar spectrum, all he could see was a continuous band of colors.
1.4742105263157892 If the spectrum of the white light from the Sun and stars were simply a continuous rainbow of colors, astronomers would have little interest in the detailed study of a star’s spectrum once they had learned its average surface temperature.
0.6607692307692308 In 1802, however, William Wollaston built an improved spectrometer that included a lens to focus the Sun’s spectrum on a screen.
0.5471428571428572 With this device, Wollaston saw that the colors were not spread out uniformly, but instead, some ranges of color were missing, appearing as dark bands in the solar spectrum.
0.51 He mistakenly attributed these lines to natural boundaries between the colors.
0.6018181818181818 In 1815, German physicist Joseph Fraunhofer, upon a more careful examination of the solar spectrum, found about 600 such dark lines (missing colors), which led scientists to rule out the boundary hypothesis (Figure 5.11).
0.9146153846153846 Later, researchers found that similar dark lines could be produced in the spectra (“spectra” is the plural of “spectrum”) of artificial light sources.
0.44999999999999996 They did this by passing their light through various apparently transparent substances—usually containers with just a bit of thin gas in them.
0.255 These gases turned out not to be transparent at all colors: they were quite opaque at a few sharply defined wavelengths.
0.6344444444444445 All gases did this, but each different element absorbed a different set of colors and thus showed different dark lines.
0.7281818181818182 If the gas in a container consisted of two elements, then light passing through it was missing the colors (showing dark lines) for both of the elements.
0.8700000000000001 So it became clear that certain lines in the spectrum “go with” certain elements.
0.5433333333333333 This discovery was one of the most important steps forward in the history of astronomy.
0.7599999999999999 What would happen if there were no continuous spectrum for our gases to remove light from?
0.9414285714285715 What if, instead, we heated the same thin gases until they were hot enough to glow with their own light?
1.1122222222222222 When the gases were heated, a spectrometer revealed no continuous spectrum, but several separate bright lines.
0.4675 That is, these hot gases emitted light only at certain specific wavelengths or colors.
0.5175000000000001 When the gas was pure hydrogen, it would emit one pattern of colors; when it was pure sodium, it would emit a different pattern.
0.9557142857142856 A mixture of hydrogen and sodium emitted both sets of spectral lines.
0.4925 The colors the gases emitted when they were heated were the very same colors as those they had absorbed when a continuous source of light was behind them.
0.6607692307692308 From such experiments, scientists began to see that different substances showed distinctive spectral signatures by which their presence could be detected (Figure 5.12).
1.23 Just as your signature allows the bank to identify you, the unique pattern of colors for each type of atom (its spectrum) can help us identify which element or elements are in a gas.
