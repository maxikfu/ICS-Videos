for water, organic compounds, and other potential evidence
of microbial life.
Among the most fascinating bits of evidence to come back
from Mars were the photographs of rock formations dating
to 3.7 billion years ago, near the time we believe life began on
Earth (Fig. 3). Geologist Nora Noffke, at Old Dominion University, examined these photographs using the same criteria
geologists use to define microfossils of early life on Earth.
She observed many features of Martian rock that resemble
ancient terrestrial fossils of microbial mats—possibly cyanobacteria similar to those of Antarctic lakes. For example, flat
stretches of sediment show layers that appear folded or even
rolled up, as if a flexible mat of living cells had torn and rolled
back onto itself. Noffke compiled such a large group of features that ultimately, she argues, if such forms indicate fossil
life on Earth, they must also indicate fossil life on Mars.



MICROBIAL LIFE: ORIGIN AND DISCOVERY



If microbial life once existed on Mars, could some forms
live on, perhaps under the rock strata where pockets of water
remain? As of this writing, Curiosity’s quest for data rolls on.

How can we be sure that a fossil formation arose biogenically—that is, from a life-form? Could you define quantitative

THE MICROBIAL CELL

Finally, we address the exciting century of molecular
microbiology, in which microbial genetics, genomics, and
evolution have transformed the practice of medicine and
our understanding of the natural world.

species of protists, such as giant amebas, grow to sizes
large enough to see with the unaided eye. The marine
sulfur bacterium Thiomargarita namibiensis, called the
“sulfur pearl of Namibia,” grows to 0.7 mm, larger than
the eye of a fruit fly (Fig. 1.4). Even more surprising,
a single cell of the “killer alga” Caulerpa taxifolia covers acres beneath the coastal waters of California. The
alga expands and forms leafl ike extensions without cell
division.

From Germ to Genome:
What Is a Microbe?

From early childhood, we hear that we are surrounded by
microscopic organisms, or “germs,” which we cannot see.
What are these microbes? Our modern concept of a microbe
has deepened through the use of two major research tools:
advanced microscopy and the sequencing of genomic DNA.
Microscopy is covered in Chapter 2, and genome sequencing is presented in Chapter 7. Exciting tools of “synthetic
biology,” to engineer new kinds of microbes, are described
in Chapter 12.



Microbial communities. Many microbes form complex
multicellular assemblages, such as mushrooms, kelps,
and biofilms. In these structures, cells are differentiated
into distinct types that complement each other’s functions, as in multicellular organisms. And yet, some multicellular worms and arthropods require a microscope
for us to see but are not considered microbes.



Viruses. A virus is a noncellular particle containing
genetic material that takes over the metabolism of a cell
to generate more virus particles. Some viruses consist of
only a short chromosome packed in protein. Other kinds
of viruses, such as pandoraviruses that infect amebas,
show the size and complexity of a cell. Although viruses
are not fully functional cells, some viral genomes may
have evolved from cells.

A Microbe Is a Microscopic Organism

A microbe is commonly defined as a living organism that
requires a microscope to be seen. Microbial cells range in
size from millimeters (mm) down to 0.2 micrometer (µm),
and viruses may be tenfold smaller (Table 1.1). Some
microbes consist of a single cell, the smallest unit of life,
a membrane-enclosed compartment of water solution containing molecules that carry out metabolism. Each microbe
contains a genome used to reproduce its own kind. Microbial cells acquire food, gain energy to build themselves, and
respond to environmental change. Microbes evolve at rapid
rates—often fast enough to observe in the laboratory (discussed in Chapter 17).
Our simple definition of a microbe, however, leaves us
with contradictions:


Super-size microbial cells. Most single-celled organisms
require a microscope to render them visible, and thus
they fit the defi nition of a microbe. Nevertheless, some

How have we learned how microbes work? A key tool is the
study of microbial genomes. A genome is the total genetic
information contained in an organism’s chromosomal
DNA. The genes in a microbe’s genome and the sequence
of DNA tell us a lot about how that microbe grows and
associates with other species. For example, if a microbe’s
genome includes genes for nitrogenase, a nitrogen-fixing
enzyme, that microbe probably can fix nitrogen from the
atmosphere into proteins—its own proteins and those of
associated plants. And by comparing DNA sequences of
different microbes, we can figure out how closely related
they are and how they evolved.
The first method of DNA sequencing that was fast
enough to sequence large genomes was developed by
Fred Sanger (1918–2013) at the University of Cambridge
(Fig. 1.5). This achievement—which jump-started the study
of molecular biology—earned Sanger the 1980 Nobel Prize
in Chemistry, together with Walter Gilbert and Paul Berg.
Sanger and colleagues used the new method to sequence
DNA containing tens of thousands of base pairs, such as the
DNA of the human mitochondrion. In Figure 1.5, Sanger
inspects a “DNA ladder,” an X-ray exposure of radiolabeled
DNA fragments in a classic sequencing reaction.
But most genomes of cells contain millions, or even billions, of base pairs. In 1995, scientists completed the first
genome sequence of a cellular microbe, the bacterium



In practice, our definition of a microbe derives from tradition as well as genetic considerations. In this book we
consider microbes to include prokaryotes (cells lacking a
nucleus, including bacteria and archaea) as well as certain
classes of eukaryotes (cells with a nucleus), such as algae,
fungi, and protists (discussed in Chapter 20). The bacteria,
archaea, and eukaryotes—known as the three “domains”—
evolved from a common ancestral cell (see Section 1.5 and
Chapter 21). Viruses and even smaller infectious particles
are discussed in Chapters 6 and 11.

devised a special computational strategy for assembling large amounts of sequence
data—a strategy later used to sequence the human genome.
Today we sequence new bacterial genomes daily. In
addition to sequencing individual genomes, computational
strategies are used to sequence thousands of genomes of
microbes sampled from a natural environment, such as
the acid drainage from an iron mine. The collection of
sequences taken directly from the environment is called a

metagenome. The first metagenome of an acid mine was
sequenced by Jill Banfield and co-workers at UC Berkeley
in 2004. Now, metagenomes are sequenced for microbial
communities of medical interest, such as that of the human
colon. Human gut microbes contain 100 times more genes
in their metagenomes than the human genome contains—
and many of these microbial genes contribute to our health!
Comparing genomes has revealed a set of core genes
shared by all organisms. These core genes add further evidence that all life on Earth, including humans, shares a
common ancestry. Genomes are discussed further in Chapter 7, and the evolution of genomes and metagenomes is
discussed in Chapters 17 and 21.

microbiology, scientists established the fundamental principles of disease pathology and microbial ecology that
are still in use today. This period laid the foundation for
modern biology, in which genetics and molecular biology
provide powerful tools for scientists to manipulate microorganisms for medicine, research, and industry.

Microbes Shape
Human History

Today our knowledge of microbes is enormous, and it keeps
growing. Yet throughout most of human history we were
unaware of how microbes shaped our culture. Yeasts and bacteria made foods such as bread and cheese (Fig. 1.8A), as
well as alcoholic beverages (discussed in Chapter 16). “Rockeating” bacteria, known as “lithotrophs,” leached copper and
other metals from ores exposed by mining, enabling ancient
human miners to obtain these metals. The lithotrophic oxidation of minerals for energy generates strong acids, which accelerate breakdown of the ore. Today about 20% of the world’s
copper, as well as some uranium and zinc, is produced by
bacterial leaching. Unfortunately, microbial acidification also
consumes the stone of ancient monuments (Fig. 1.8B)—a
process intensified by airborne acidic pollution.
How did people find out about microbes? (Table 1.2,
pages 10–11). Microscopists in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries formulated key concepts about microbes
and their existence, including their means of reproduction
and death. In the nineteenth century, the “golden age” of

which wiped out a third of Europe’s population in the fourteenth century, was caused by Yersinia pestis, a bacterium
spread by rat fleas. Ironically, the plague-induced population decline enabled the social transformation that led to the
Renaissance, a period of unprecedented cultural advancement. In the nineteenth century, the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis stalked overcrowded cities, and tuberculosis
was so common that the pallid appearance of tubercular
patients became a symbol of tragic youth in European arts,
such as Puccini’s opera La Bohème. Today, societies throughout the world are devastated by the epidemic of acquired
immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), caused by the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The United Nations estimates that 35 million people are living with HIV infection
today, and this year 1.2 million will die of AIDS.
Historians traditionally emphasize the role of warfare in
shaping human destiny, and the brilliance of leaders, or the
advantage of new technology, in determining which civilizations rise or fall. Yet the fate of human societies is often
determined by microbes. For example, much of the native
population of North America was exterminated by smallpox introduced by European invaders. Throughout history, more soldiers have died of microbial infections than
of wounds in battle.
The significance of disease in warfare was first recognized by the British nurse and statistician Florence Nightingale (1820–1910) (Fig. 1.10A). Better known as the
founder of professional nursing, Nightingale also founded

the science of medical statistics. She used methods invented
by French statisticians to demonstrate the high mortality rate due to disease among British soldiers during the
Crimean War. To show the deaths of soldiers due to various
causes, she devised the “polar area chart” (Fig. 1.10B). In
this chart, blue wedges represent deaths due to infectious
disease, red wedges represent deaths due to wounds, and
black wedges represent all other causes of death. Infectious
disease accounts for more than half of all mortality.
Before Nightingale, no one understood the impact of
disease on armies, or on other crowded populations, such
as in cities. Nightingale’s statistics convinced the British government to improve army living conditions and to
upgrade the standards of army hospitals. In modern epidemiology, statistical analysis continues to be a crucial tool in
determining the causes of disease.

Microscopes Reveal the Microbial World

The seventeenth century was a time of growing inquiry
and excitement about the “natural magic” of science and
patterns of our world, such as the laws of gravitation and
motion formulated by Isaac Newton (1642–1727). Robert
Boyle (1627–1691) performed the first controlled experiments on the chemical conversion of matter. Physicians
attempted new treatments for disease involving the application of “stone and minerals” (that is, chemicals)—what
today we would call “chemotherapy.” Minds were open to

his teeth after drinking a hot beverage suggested that heat
killed microbes—a profoundly important principle for the
study and control of microbes ever since.
Leeuwenhoek is believed to have died, ironically, of a disease contracted from sheep whose bacteria he had observed.
Historians have often wondered why it took so many centuries for Leeuwenhoek and his successors to determine
the link between microbes and disease. Although observers
such as Agostino Bassi de Lodi (1773–1856) noted cases
of microbes associated with pathology (see Table 1.2),
the very ubiquity of microbes—most of them actually
harmless—may have obscured their more deadly roles. In
addition, it was hard to distinguish between microbes and
the single-celled components of the human body, such
as blood cells and sperm. It was not until the nineteenth
century that human tissues could be distinguished from
microbial cells by the application of differential chemical
stains (discussed in Chapter 2).
Thought Question

1.3 Why do you think it took so long for humans to connect
microbes with infectious disease?

Spontaneous Generation:
Do Microbes Have Parents?

The observation of microscopic organisms led priests and
philosophers to wonder where these tiny beings came from.
In the eighteenth century, scientists and church leaders
intensely debated the question of spontaneous generation.
Spontaneous generation is the concept that living creatures such as maggots could arise spontaneously, without
parental organisms. Chemists of the day tended to support
spontaneous generation, as it appeared similar to the way
chemicals changed during reaction. Christian church leaders, however, supported the biblical view that all organisms
have “parents” going back to the first week of creation.
The Italian priest Francesco Redi (1626–1697) showed
that maggots in decaying meat were the offspring of flies.
Meat kept in a sealed container, excluding flies, did not
produce maggots. Thus, Redi’s experiment argued against
spontaneous generation for macroscopic organisms. The
meat still putrefied, however, producing microbes that
seemed to arise “without parents.”
To disprove spontaneous generation of microbes, another
Italian priest, Lazzaro Spallanzani (1729–1799), showed
that a sealed flask of meat broth sterilized by boiling failed
to grow microbes. Spallanzani also noticed that microbes
often appeared in pairs. Were these two parental microbes
coupling to produce offspring, or did one microbe become
two? Through long and tenacious observation, Spallanzani

watched a single microbe grow in size until it split in two.
Thus he demonstrated cell fission, the process by which
cells arise by the splitting of preexisting cells.
Even Spallanzani’s experiments, however, did not put
the matter to rest. Proponents of spontaneous generation
argued that the microbes in the priest’s flask lacked access
to oxygen and therefore could not grow. The pursuit of this
question was left to future microbiologists, including the
famous French microbiologist Louis Pasteur (1822–1895)
(Fig. 1.13A). In addressing spontaneous generation and
related questions, Pasteur and his contemporaries laid the
foundations for modern microbiology.
Louis Pasteur reveals the biochemical basis of microbial
growth. Pasteur began his scientific career as a chemist and

wrote his doctoral thesis on the structure of organic crystals. He discovered the fundamental chemical property of
chirality, the fact that some organic molecules exist in two
forms that differ only by mirror symmetry. In other words,
the two structures are mirror images of one another,
like the right and left hands. Pasteur found that when
microbes were cultured on a nutrient substance containing
both mirror forms, only one mirror form was consumed.

such a flask remain free of microbial growth, despite access to air.

CHAPTER 1

He concluded that the metabolic preference for one mirror form was a fundamental property of life. Subsequent
research has confi rmed that most molecules of organisms,
such as DNA and proteins, are found in only one of their
mirror forms.
As a chemist, Pasteur was asked to help with a widespread
problem encountered by French manufacturers of wine and
beer. The alcohol in beverages comes from fermentation, a
process by which microbes gain energy by converting sugars into alcohol. In the time of Pasteur, however, the conversion of grapes or grain to alcohol was believed to be a
spontaneous chemical process. No one could explain why
some fermentation mixtures produced vinegar (acetic acid)
instead of alcohol. Pasteur discovered that fermentation is
actually caused by living yeast, a single-celled fungus. In
the absence of oxygen, yeast produces alcohol as a terminal
waste product. But when the yeast culture is contaminated
with bacteria, the bacteria outgrow the yeast and produce
acetic acid instead of alcohol. (Fermentative metabolism is
discussed in Chapter 13.)
Pasteur’s work on fermentation led him to test a key
claim made by proponents of spontaneous generation. The
proponents claimed that Spallanzani’s failure to find spontaneous appearance of microbes was due to lack of oxygen.
From his studies of yeast fermentation, Pasteur knew that
some microbial species do not require oxygen for growth.
So he devised an unsealed flask with a long, bent “swan
neck” that admitted air but kept the boiled contents free of
dust that carried microbes (Fig. 1.13B). The famous swannecked flasks remained free of microbial growth for many
years, but when a flask was tilted to enable contact of broth
with dust, microbes grew immediately. Thus, Pasteur disproved that lack of oxygen was the reason for the failure of
spontaneous generation in Spallanzani’s flasks.
But even Pasteur’s work did not prove that microbial
growth requires preexisting microbes. The Irish scientist
John Tyndall (1820–1893) attempted the same experiment
as Pasteur but sometimes found the opposite result. Tyndall
found that the broth sometimes gave rise to microbes no
matter how long it was sterilized by boiling. The microbes
appear because some kinds of organic matter, particularly
hay infusion, are contaminated with a heat-resistant form
of bacteria called “endospores” (or “spores”). The spore
form can be eliminated only by repeated cycles of boiling
and resting, in which the spores germinate to the growing,
vegetative form that is killed at 100°C.
It was later discovered that endospores could be killed
by boiling under pressure, as in a pressure cooker, which
generates higher temperatures than can be obtained at
atmospheric pressure. The steam pressure device called the
autoclave became the standard way to sterilize materials
for the controlled study of microbes. (Microbial control
and antisepsis are discussed further in Chapter 5.)



MICROBIAL LIFE: ORIGIN AND DISCOVERY



15

Although spontaneous generation was discredited as a
continual source of microbes, at some point in the past the
first living organisms must have originated from nonliving
materials. How did the first microbes arise? Experiments
that aim to replicate the conditions of early Earth yield
simple amino acids and bases of DNA and RNA (see Special Topic 1.1). The earliest fossil evidence of cells appears
in sedimentary rock that formed more than 2 billion years
ago, and amazingly similar formations are found on Mars.
The experimental basis for the origin of life and evolution is discussed in detail in Chapter 17.

To Summarize












Microbes affected human civilization for centuries
before humans guessed at their existence through their
contributions to our environment, food and drink production, and infectious diseases.
Florence Nightingale statistically quantified the impact
of infectious disease on human populations.
Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek were
the first to record observations of microbes through
simple microscopes.
Spontaneous generation is the theory that microbes
arise spontaneously, without parental organisms. Lazzaro Spallanzani showed that microbes arise from
preexisting microbes and demonstrated that heat sterilization can prevent microbial growth.
Louis Pasteur discovered the microbial basis of fermentation. He also showed that providing oxygen does not
enable spontaneous generation.
John Tyndall showed that repeated cycles of heat were
necessary to eliminate spores formed by certain kinds of
bacteria.

1.3

Medical Microbiology

Over the centuries, thoughtful observers such as Fracastoro
and Bassi (see Table 1.2) noted a connection between
microbes and disease. Ultimately, researchers developed the
germ theory of disease, the theory that many diseases are
caused by microbes. Research today pursues the secrets of
many microbial diseases, such as cholera, the focus of Rita
Colwell, first microbiologist to direct the National Science
Foundation (eTopic 1.1).
The first scientific basis for determining that a specific microbe causes a disease was devised by the

German physician Robert Koch (1843–1910) A.
(Fig. 1.14). As a college student, Koch conducted biochemical experiments on his own
digestive system. Koch’s curiosity about
the natural world led him to develop principles and methods crucial to microbial
investigation, including the pure-culture
technique and the famous Koch’s postulates for identifying the causative agent of
a disease. He applied his methods to numerMUSEUM IN THE ROBERT
ous lethal diseases around the world, includ- KOCH-INSTITUT BERLIN
ing anthrax and tuberculosis in Europe, bubonic
plague in India, and malaria in New Guinea (Fig. 1.15).

Growth of Microbes in Pure Culture

Unlike Pasteur, who was a university professor, Koch took
up a medical practice in a small Polish-German town. To
make space in his home for a laboratory to study anthrax
and other deadly diseases, his wife curtained off part of his
patient examination room.
Anthrax interested Koch because its epidemics in sheep
and cattle caused economic hardship among local farmers.
Today, anthrax is no longer a major problem for agriculture, because its transmission is prevented by effective environmental controls and vaccination. It has, however, gained
notoriety as a bioterror agent because anthrax bacteria can
survive for long periods in the dormant desiccated form of
an endospore. In 2001, anthrax spores sent through the
mail contaminated post offices as well as an office building
of the U.S. Senate, causing several deaths.
To investigate whether anthrax was a transmissible disease, Koch used blood from an anthrax-infected cow carcass to inoculate a rabbit. When the rabbit died, he used
its blood to inoculate a second rabbit, which then died in
turn. The blood of the unfortunate animal had turned
black with long, rod-shaped bacilli. Upon introduction
of these bacilli into healthy animals, the animals became
ill with anthrax. Thus, Koch demonstrated an important
principle of epidemiology: the chain of infection, or transmission of a disease. In retrospect, his choice of anthrax
was fortunate, because anthrax microbes generate disease
very quickly, multiply in the blood to high numbers, and
remain infective outside the body for long periods.
Koch and his colleagues then applied their experimental
logic and culture methods to a more challenging disease:
tuberculosis. In Koch’s day, tuberculosis caused oneseventh of all reported deaths in Europe; today, tuberculosis bacteria continue to infect millions of people worldwide.
Koch’s approach to anthrax, however, was less applicable to
tuberculosis, a disease that develops slowly after many years
of dormancy. Furthermore, the causative bacterium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is small and difficult to distinguish

appearance associated with the human body. How could
Koch prove that a particular bacterium caused a particular
disease?
What was needed was to isolate a pure culture of microorganisms, a culture grown from a single “parental” cell.
Previous researchers had achieved pure cultures by a laborious process of serially diluting suspended bacteria until
a culture tube contained only a single cell. Alternatively,
inoculating a solid surface such as a sliced potato could produce isolated colonies—distinct populations of bacteria,
each grown from a single cell. For M. tuberculosis, Koch
inoculated serum, which then formed a solid gel after heating. Later he refined the solid-substrate technique by adding gelatin to a defined liquid medium, which could then
be chilled to form a solid medium in a glass dish. A covered

Koch’s Postulates

A.
THE NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE

For his successful determination of the bacterium that
causes tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Koch was
awarded the 1905 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
Koch formulated his famous set of criteria for establishing a causative link between an infectious agent and a disease (Fig. 1.17). These four criteria are known as Koch’s
postulates:

CYTOGRAPHICS/VISUALS UNLIMITED

1. The microbe is found in all cases of the disease but is
absent from healthy individuals.
2. The microbe is isolated from the diseased host and
grown in pure culture.
3. When the microbe is introduced into a healthy, susceptible host (or animal model), the host shows the same
disease.
4. The same strain of microbe is obtained from the newly
diseased host. When cultured, the strain shows the
same characteristics as before.

version called the petri dish (or “petri plate”) was invented
by a colleague, Julius Richard Petri (1852–1921). The
petri dish is a round dish with vertical walls covered by an
inverted dish of slightly larger diameter. Today the petri
dish, generally made of disposable plastic, remains an indispensable part of the microbiological laboratory.
Another improvement in solid-substrate culture was the
replacement of gelatin with materials that remain solid at
higher temperatures, such as the gelling agent agar (a polymer of the sugar galactose). The use of agar was recommended by Angelina Hesse (1850–1934), a microscopist
and illustrator, to her husband, Walther Hesse (1846–
1911), a young medical colleague of Koch (Fig. 1.16).
Agar comes from red algae (seaweed), which is used by East
Indian birds to build nests; it is the main ingredient in the
delicacy “bird’s nest soup.” Dutch colonists used agar to
make jellies and preserves, and a Dutch colonist from Java
introduced it to Angelina Hesse. The Hesses used agar to
develop the first effective growth medium for tuberculosis
bacteria. Pure culture and growth conditions are discussed
further in Chapters 4 and 5.
Note that some kinds of microbes cannot be grown in
pure culture—that is, without other organisms. For example, the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus, a major
source of Earth’s oxygen, requires heterotrophic bacteria
to remove toxic oxygen radicals. And all viruses can be cultured only within their host cells (see Chapter 6). The discovery of viruses is explored at the end of this section.

PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

Koch’s postulates continue to be used to determine
whether a given strain of microbe causes a disease. An
example is Lyme disease (borreliosis), a tick-borne infection first described in New England, and shown in 1981 to
be caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. Nevertheless, the postulates remain only a guide; individual diseases
and pathogens may confound one or more of the criteria.
For example, tuberculosis bacteria are now known to cause
symptoms in only 10% of the people infected. If Koch had
been able to detect these silent bacilli, they would not have
fulfilled his first criterion. In the case of AIDS, the concentration of HIV virus is so low that initially no virus could
be detected in patients with fully active symptoms. It took
the invention of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a
method of producing any number of copies of DNA or
RNA sequences, to detect the presence of HIV. Modern
research on microbial disease is presented in Chapter 25.
Another difficulty with AIDS and many other human
diseases is the absence of an animal host that exhibits the
same disease. For AIDS, even chimpanzees (our closest relatives) are not susceptible, although they acquire a similar disease from related retroviruses. For diseases without
a cure, experimental inoculation of humans is banned by
law. Curable or self-limiting diseases may be tested on volunteers in clinical trials. In rare cases, researchers have voluntarily exposed themselves to a proposed pathogen. For
example, Australian researcher Barry Marshall ingested
Helicobacter pylori to convince skeptical colleagues that
this organism could colonize the extremely acidic stomach.
H. pylori turned out to be the causative agent of gastritis
and stomach ulcers, conditions that had long been thought
to be caused by stress rather than infection. For the discovery of H. pylori and its role in gastritis, Marshall and

colleague J. Robin Warren won the 2005 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine.

Thought Question

1.4 How could you use Koch’s postulates (Fig. 1.17) to
demonstrate the causative agent of influenza? What problems
not encountered with anthrax would you need to overcome?

Immunization Prevents Disease

Identifying the cause of a disease is, of course, only the
first step in developing an effective therapy and preventing further transmission. Early microbiologists achieved
some remarkable insights on how to control pathogens
(see Table 1.2).
The first clue of how to protect an individual from a
deadly disease came from the dreaded smallpox. In the
eighteenth century, smallpox infected a large fraction of
the European population, killing or disfiguring many people. In countries of Asia and Africa, however, the incidence
of smallpox was decreased by the practice of deliberately
inoculating children with material from smallpox pustules.
Inoculated children usually developed a mild case of the
disease and were protected from smallpox thereafter.
The practice of smallpox inoculation was introduced from
Turkey to Europe in 1717 by Lady Mary Montagu, a smallpox survivor (Fig. 1.18A). While traveling in Turkey, Lady
Montagu learned that many elderly women there had perfected the art of inoculation: “The old woman comes with
a nut-shell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox,
and asks what vein you please to have opened.” During a

physicians developed several effective examples of immunization, the stimulation of an immune response by deliberate
inoculation with an attenuated pathogen.
The way to attenuate a strain depends on the pathogen.
Heat treatment or aging for various periods often turns out
to be the most effective approach. The original success of
prophylactic smallpox inoculation was due to natural attenuation of the virus during the time between acquisition of
smallpox matter from a diseased individual and inoculation
of the healthy patient. A far more elaborate treatment was
required to combat the most famous disease for which Pasteur devised a vaccine: rabies.
The rabid dog loomed large in folklore, and rabies was
dreaded for its particularly horrible and inevitable course of
death. Pasteur’s vaccine for rabies required a highly complex series of heat treatments and repeated inoculations. Its
success led to his instant fame (Fig. 1.19). Grateful survivors of rabies founded the Pasteur Institute for medical
research, one of the world’s greatest medical research institutions, whose scientists in the twentieth century discovered the virus HIV, which causes AIDS.

Antiseptics and Antibiotics

Before the work of Koch and Pasteur, many patients died
of infections transmitted unwittingly by their own doctors.

INSTITUT PASTEUR

period outside the host, the virus becomes “attenuated”—
that is, loses some of its molecular structure required for
infection. The attenuated virus stimulates the immune system with much lower mortality than does the fully virulent
virus. Lady Montagu arranged for the procedure on her own
son and then brought the practice back to England. A similar practice of smallpox inoculation was introduced to the
American colonies by a slave, Onesimus, from the Coromantee people of Africa. Onesimus convinced his master, Reverend Dr. Cotton Mather, to promote smallpox inoculation as
a defense against an epidemic that was devastating Boston.
Preventive inoculation with smallpox was dangerous,
however, because some infected individuals still contracted
serious disease and were contagious. Thus, doctors continued to seek a better method of prevention. In England,
milkmaids claimed that they were protected from smallpox after they contracted cowpox (caused by vaccinia
virus), a related but much milder disease. English physician Edward Jenner (1749–1823) confirmed this claim by
deliberately infecting patients with matter from cowpox
lesions (Fig. 1.18B). The practice of cowpox inoculation
was called vaccination, after the Latin word vacca, meaning “cow.” At the time, the practice was highly controversial, as people feared they would somehow turn into cows
(Fig. 1.18C). Today, unfortunately, modern immunizations still raise irrational concerns. Failure to accept immunization leads to outbreaks of preventable disease, such as
the Disneyland measles outbreak in 2015.
Pasteur was aware of vaccination as he studied the course
of various diseases in experimental animals. In the spring of
1879, he was studying fowl cholera, a transmissible disease of
chickens with a high death rate. He had isolated and cultured
the bacteria that had killed the chickens, but he left his work
during the summer for a long vacation. No refrigeration was
available to preserve cultures, and when he returned to work,
the aged bacteria failed to cause disease in his chickens. Pasteur then obtained fresh bacteria from an outbreak of disease
elsewhere, as well as some new chickens. But the fresh bacteria failed to make the original chickens sick (those that had
been exposed to the aged bacteria). All of the new chickens,
exposed only to the fresh bacteria, contracted the disease.
Grasping the clue from his mistake, Pasteur had the insight to
recognize that an attenuated strain of microbe, altered somehow to eliminate its potency to cause disease, could still confer immunity to the virulent disease-causing form.
Pasteur was the first to recognize the significance of attenuation and extend the principle to other pathogens. We now
know that the molecular components of pathogens generate
immunity, the resistance to a specific disease, by stimulating the immune system, an organism’s exceedingly complex
cellular mechanisms of defense (see Chapters 23 and 24).
Understanding the immune system awaited the techniques
of molecular biology a century later, but nineteenth-century

PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

In 1847, Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis (1818–
1865) noticed that the death rate of women in childbirth
due to puerperal fever was much higher in his own hospital than in a birthing center run by midwives. He guessed
that the doctors in his hospital were transmitting pathogens from cadavers that they had dissected. So he ordered
the doctors to wash their hands in chlorine, an antiseptic agent (a chemical that kills microbes). The mortality
rate fell, but this revelation displeased other doctors, who
refused to accept Semmelweis’s findings.
In 1865, the British surgeon Joseph Lister (1827–1912)
noted that half of his amputee patients died of sepsis. Lister
knew from Pasteur that microbial contamination might be
the cause. So he began experiments to develop the use of
antiseptic agents, most successfully carbolic acid, to treat
wounds and surgical instruments. After initial resistance,
Lister’s work, with the support of Pasteur and Koch, drew
widespread recognition. In the twentieth century, surgeons
developed fully aseptic environments for surgery—that is,
environments completely free of microbes.
The problem with most antiseptic chemicals that killed
microbes was that if taken internally, they would also kill
the patients. Researchers sought a “magic bullet,” an antibiotic molecule that would kill only microbes, leaving their
host unharmed.
An important step in the search for antibiotics was the
realization that microbes themselves produce antibiotic
compounds. This conclusion followed from the famous
accidental discovery of penicillin by the Scottish medical
researcher Alexander Fleming (1881–1955) (Fig. 1.20A).
In 1929, Fleming was culturing Staphylococcus, which
infects wounds. He found that one of his plates of Staphylococcus was contaminated with a mold, Penicillium notatum, which he noticed was surrounded by a clear region
free of Staphylococcus colonies (Fig. 1.20B). Following up
on this observation, Fleming showed that the mold produced a substance that killed bacteria. We now know this
substance as penicillin.
In 1941, biochemists Howard Florey (1898–1968) and
Ernst Chain (1906–1979) purified the penicillin molecule,
which we now know inhibits formation of the bacterial cell
wall. Penicillin saved the lives of many Allied troops during
World War II, the first war in which an antibiotic became
available to soldiers.
The second half of the twentieth century saw the discovery of many new and powerful antibiotics. Most of the
new antibiotics, however, were made by little-known bacteria and fungi from endangered ecosystems—a circumstance that focused attention on wilderness preservation.
Furthermore, the widespread and often indiscriminate use
of antibiotics selects for pathogens to evolve resistance to
antibiotics. As a result, antibiotics have lost their effectiveness against certain strains of major pathogens. For example, multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis and

serious threats to public health. To combat evolving drug
resistance, we continually need to research and develop
new antibiotics. Microbial biosynthesis of antibiotics is discussed in Chapter 15, and the medical use of antibiotics is
discussed in Chapter 27.

Thought Questions

1.5 Why do you think some pathogens generate immunity
readily, whereas others evade the immune system?
1.6 How do you think microbes protect themselves from the
antibiotics they produce?

The Discovery of Viruses

Viruses are much smaller than the host cells they infect;
most are too small to be seen by a light microscope. So how
were they discovered? In 1892, the Russian botanist Dmitri Ivanovsky (1864–1920) studied tobacco mosaic disease,
a condition in which the leaves become mottled and the
crop yield is decreased or destroyed altogether. Ivanovsky
knew that some kind of microbe from the diseased plants
transmitted the disease, and he wondered how small it was.
He was surprised to find that the agent of transmission
could pass through a porcelain filter having a pore size
(0.1 µm) that blocked known microbes. Later, the Dutch
plant microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck (1851–1931) conducted similar filtration experiments. Beijerinck concluded
that because the agent of disease passed through a filter
that retained bacteria, it could not be a bacterial cell.
The “filterable agent” of disease was ultimately purified
by the American scientist Wendell Stanley (1904–1971),
who processed 4,000 kilograms (kg) of infected tobacco
leaves. Stanley obtained a sample of infective virus particles pure enough to crystallize, in a 3D array comparable
to crystals composed of inert chemicals. The crystal was
analyzed by X-ray crystallography (discussed in Chapter 2)
to reveal the molecular structure of tobacco mosaic virus
(Fig. 1.21A)—a feat that earned Stanley the 1946 Nobel
Prize in Chemistry. The fact that an object capable of biological reproduction could be stable enough to be crystallized amazed scientists, ultimately leading to a new, more
mechanical view of living organisms. Today, we consider
viruses “subcellular organisms.” Even smaller subcellular
entities that replicate within cells include plasmids and prions (see Chapter 6).
The individual particle of tobacco mosaic virus consists
of a helical tube of protein subunits containing its genetic
material coiled within (Fig. 1.21B). Stanley thought the
virus was a catalytic protein, but colleagues later determined that it contained RNA as its genetic material. The
structure of the coiled RNA was solved through X-ray
crystallography by the British scientist Rosalind Franklin (1920–1958). Other viruses that have RNA genomes
include influenza and HIV (AIDS); viruses with DNA
genomes include polio and herpes viruses. We now know
that all kinds of animals, plants, and microbial cells can
be infected by viruses—and carry endogenous viruses that

may benefit their hosts. Viral function and disease are discussed in Chapters 6, 11, and 26.

To Summarize
















Robert Koch devised techniques of pure culture to
study a single species of microbe in isolation. A key technique is culture on solid medium using agar, as developed by Angelina and Walther Hesse, in a double-dish
container devised by Julius Petri.
Koch’s postulates provide a set of criteria to establish a
causative link between an infectious agent and a disease.
Edward Jenner established the practice of vaccination,
inoculation with cowpox to prevent smallpox. Jenner’s
discovery was based on earlier observations by Lady
Mary Montagu and others that a mild case of smallpox
could prevent future cases.
Louis Pasteur developed the first vaccines based on
attenuated strains, such as the rabies vaccine.
Ignaz Semmelweis and Joseph Lister showed that
antiseptics could prevent transmission of pathogens
from doctor to patient.
Alexander Fleming discovered that the Penicillium
mold generates a substance that kills bacteria.
Howard Florey and Ernst Chain purified the substance penicillin, the first commercial antibiotic to save
human lives.
Dmitri Ivanovsky and Martinus Beijerinck discovered
viruses as filterable infective particles. Viruses, which
may be harmful or beneficial, infect all kinds of cells.

Bacterial Endosymbiosis
with Plants and Animals

AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR MICROBIOLOGY.

Within plant cells, certain bacteria fix nitrogen as endosymbionts, organisms living symbiotically inside larger organisms. Endosymbiotic bacteria known as rhizobia induce the
roots of legumes to form special nodules to facilitate bacterial nitrogen fixation. Rhizobial endosymbiosis was first
observed by Martinus Beijerinck. Microbial endosymbiosis, in a variety of diverse forms, is widespread in all ecosystems. Many interesting cases involve animal or human
hosts. Endosymbiotic microbes make essential nutritional
contributions to host animals. Ruminant animals such as
cattle, as well as insects such as termites, require digestive
bacteria to break down cellulose and other plant polymers.
Even humans obtain about 15% of their nutrition from
colonic bacteria (Fig. 1.25). Intestinal bacteria such as
E. coli and Bacteroides species grow as biofilms, organized
multispecies communities adhering to a surface. Biofilms
play major roles in all ecosystems and within parts of the
human body (discussed in Chapters 4 and 21). The biofilm shown in Figure 1.25B is attached to the surface of a
digested food particle. Most kinds of plant fibers that we

consume actually require microbial enzymes to digest (see
Chapter 21).
Many invertebrates, such as hydras and corals, harbor
endosymbiotic phototrophs that provide products of photosynthesis in return for protection and nutrients. Other kinds
of endosymbiosis involve more than nutrition. In the light
organs of squid, luminescent bacteria, such as Aliivibrio
fischeri, produce light (bioluminescence) that helps the
host evade nocturnal predators. The host squid controls
the amount and direction of light that leaves the organ so
that it matches the illumination from the moon, rendering
the squid nearly invisible. Bacteria that normally inhabit the
human intestine and skin protect our bodies from infection
by pathogens. Gut bacteria regulate development of our
immune system, and even send signals to the brain.
The human microbiota or microbiome is the collection
of all microbes associated with the human body. Physicians
increasingly consider the human microbiome to be a part
of the body, as essential as a limb or an organ. In 2016, the
U.S. government announced the National Microbiome Initiative to advance understanding of how microbiomes contribute to our health and the environment. Microbiomes
are discussed further in Chapter 21.

Note: The terms microbiota and microbiome have similar meaning. “Microbiota” refers to the ecological community of
microbes living within or upon the human body. “Microbiome”
refers to the community of microbes associated with a human
organ, or with a different defined habitat such as soil or plants.
Another term, metagenome, refers to the collective genetic
sequences found in all the microbes of a microbiome.

CHAPTER 1

To Summarize










Sergei Winogradsky developed the first system of
enrichment culture, called the Winogradsky column, to
grow microbes from natural environments.
Chemolithotrophs (or lithotrophs) metabolize inorganic minerals, such as ammonia, instead of the organic
nutrients used by the microbes isolated by Koch.
Geochemical cycling depends on bacteria and archaea
that cycle nitrogen, phosphorus, and other minerals
throughout the biosphere.
Endosymbionts are microbes that live within host
organisms and provide essential functions for their
hosts, such as nitrogen fixation for legume plants, or
digestion of complex food molecules for humans and
other animals.
Martinus Beijerinck was the first to demonstrate that
nitrogen-fixing rhizobia grow as endosymbionts within
leguminous plants.

1.5

The Microbial Family Tree

The bewildering diversity of microbial life-forms presented
nineteenth-century microbiologists with a seemingly impossible task of classification. So little was known about life
under the lens that natural scientists despaired of ever learning how to distinguish microbial species. The famous classifier of species, Swedish botanist Carl von Linné (Carolus
Linnaeus, 1707–1778), called the microbial world “chaos.”

Microbes Are a Challenge to Classify

Early taxonomists faced two challenges as they attempted
to classify microbes. First, the resolution of the light microscope visualized little more than the outward shape of
microbial cells, and vastly different kinds of microbes looked
more or less alike (discussed in Chapter 2). This challenge
was overcome as advances in biochemistry and microscopy
made it possible to distinguish microbes by metabolism and
cell structure, and ultimately by DNA sequence.
Second, microbes do not readily fit the classic definition of a species—that is, a group of organisms that interbreed. Unlike multicellular eukaryotes, microbes generally
reproduce asexually. When they do exchange genes, they
may do so with related strains or with distantly related species (discussed in Chapter 9). Nevertheless, microbiologists have devised working definitions of microbial species
that enable us to usefully describe populations while being



MICROBIAL LIFE: ORIGIN AND DISCOVERY



25

flexible enough to accommodate continual revision and
change (discussed in Chapter 17). The most useful definitions are based on genetic similarity. For example, two distinct species generally share no more than 95% similarity of
DNA sequence.

Note:

The names of microbial species are occasionally changed
to reflect new understanding of genetic relationships. For example,
the causative agent of bubonic plague was formerly called Bacterium pestis (1896), Bacillus pestis (1900), and Pasteurella pestis
(1923), but it is now called Yersinia pestis (1944). The older names,
however, still appear in the literature—a point to remember when
carrying out research. Names of bacteria and archaea are compiled
in the List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature
(LPSN).

Microbes Include Eukaryotes
and Prokaryotes

In the nineteenth century, taxonomists had no DNA information. As they tried to incorporate microbes into the tree
of life, they faced a conceptual dilemma because microbes
could not be categorized as either animals or plants, which
since ancient times had been considered the two “kingdoms” or major categories of life. Taxonomists attempted
to apply these categories to microbes—for example, by
including algae and fungi with plants. But German naturalist Ernst Haeckel (1834–1919) recognized that microbes
differed from both plants and animals in fundamental
aspects of their lifestyle, cellular structure, and biochemistry. Haeckel proposed that microscopic organisms constituted a third kind of life—neither animal nor plant—which
he called Monera.
In the twentieth century, biochemical studies revealed
profound distinctions even within the Monera. In particular, microbes such as protists and algae contain a nucleus
enclosed by a nuclear membrane, whereas bacteria do not.
Herbert Copeland (1902–1968) proposed a system of classification that divided Monera into two groups: the eukaryotic protists (protozoa and algae) and the prokaryotic
bacteria. Copeland’s four-kingdom classification (plants,
animals, eukaryotic protists, and prokaryotic bacteria)
was later modified by Robert Whittaker (1920–1980) to
include fungi as another kingdom of eukaryotic microbes.
Whittaker’s system thus generated five kingdoms: bacteria,
protists, fungi, and the multicellular plants and animals.

Eukaryotes Evolved through
Endosymbiosis

The five-kingdom system was modified dramatically by Lynn
Margulis (1938–2011) at the University of Massachusetts

(Fig. 1.26). Margulis tried to explain how it is
that eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria and
chloroplasts, membranous organelles that possess their own chromosomes. She proposed
that eukaryotes evolved by merging with bacteria to form composite cells by intracellular
endosymbiosis, in which one cell internalizes
another that grows within it. The endosymbiosis may ultimately generate a single organism
whose formerly independent members are now
incapable of independent existence.
Margulis proposed that early in the history
of life, respiring bacteria similar to E. coli were
engulfed by pre-eukaryotic cells, where they
evolved into mitochondria, the eukaryote’s respiratory organelles. Similarly, she proposed that a
phototroph related to cyanobacteria was taken up by
a eukaryote, giving rise to the chloroplasts of phototrophic algae and plants.

CHAPTER 1

Archaea Differ from Bacteria
and Eukaryotes

Are there cellular microbes that differ from both bacteria
and eukaryotes? Gene sequence analysis led to another startling advance in our understanding of how cells evolved. In
1977, Carl Woese (1928–2012), at the University of Illinois, was studying a group of recently discovered prokaryotes that live in seemingly hostile environments, such as
the boiling sulfur springs of Yellowstone, or that conduct
unusual kinds of metabolism, such as production of methane (methanogenesis). Woese used the sequence of the
gene for 16S ribosomal RNA (16S rRNA) as a “molecular clock,” a gene whose sequence differences can be used
to measure the time since the divergence of two species
(discussed in Chapter 17). The divergence of rRNA genes
showed that the newly discovered prokaryotes were a distinct form of life: archaea (Fig. 1.27).
The archaea resemble bacteria in their relatively simple
cell structure, in their lack of a nucleus, and in their ability to grow in a wide range of environments. In fact, many
archaea grow along with bacteria within the human colon,
or in common soil or water. But certain types of archaea,
such as the autoclave-cultured archaeon Geogemma, grow
in environments more extreme than any that support bacteria. The genetic sequences of archaea differ as much
from those of bacteria as from those of eukaryotes; in fact,
their gene expression machinery is more similar to that of
eukaryotes.
Woese’s discovery replaced the classification scheme
of five kingdoms with three equally distinct groups,
now called the three “domains”: Bacteria, Archaea, and
Eukarya (Fig. 1.28). In the three-domain model, the
bacterial ancestor of mitochondria derives from ancient
proteobacteria (shaded pink in the figure), whereas chloroplasts derive from ancient cyanobacteria (shaded green).

CARL WOESE

The endosymbiosis theory was highly controversial
because it implied a polyphyletic, or multiple, ancestry
of living species, inconsistent with the long-held assumption that species evolve only by divergence from a common ancestor (monophyletic ancestry). Ultimately, DNA
sequence analysis produced compelling evidence of the
bacterial origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Both
of these classes of organelles contain circular molecules
of DNA, whose sequences show unmistakable homology
(similarity) to those of bacteria. DNA sequences and other
evidence established the common ancestry between mitochondria and respiring bacteria, and between chloroplasts
and cyanobacteria. The symbiotic origins and evolution
of mitochondria and chloroplasts are discussed further in
Chapter 17.

the sequences of microbial genomes, although some genes
are transferred both within and between the domains
(discussed in Chapter 17).

a third domain of life? What arguments support the classification of archaea and bacteria together, as prokaryotes, distinct
from eukaryotes?



PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

To Summarize










Classifying microbes was a challenge historically
because of the difficulties in observing distinguishing
characteristics of different categories.
Ernst Haeckel recognized that microbes constitute a
form of life distinct from animals and plants.
Herbert Copeland and Robert Whittaker classified
prokaryotes as a form of microbial life distinct from
eukaryotic microbes such as protists.
Lynn Margulis proposed that eukaryotic organelles such as mitochondria and chloroplasts evolved
by endosymbiosis from prokaryotic cells engulfed by
pre-eukaryotes.
Carl Woese discovered a domain of prokaryotes, Archaea,
whose genetic sequences diverge equally from those of
bacteria and those of eukaryotes. Archaea grow in a wide
range of environments; some species grow under conditions that exclude bacteria and eukaryotes.

1.6

Cell Biology and the
DNA Revolution

During the twentieth century, amid world wars and societal
transformations, the field of microbiology exploded with
new knowledge (see Table 1.2). More than 99% of what
we know about microbes today was discovered after 1900
by scientists too numerous to cite in this book. Advances
in biochemistry and microscopy revealed the fundamental structure and function of cell membranes and proteins.
The revelation of the structures of DNA and RNA led
to the discovery of the genetic programs of model bacteria, such as E. coli, and the lambda bacteriophage. Beyond
microbiology, these advances produced the technology of
“recombinant DNA,” or genetic engineering, the construction of molecules that combine DNA sequences from unrelated species. These microbial tools offered unprecedented
applications for human medicine and industry (discussed in
Chapters 7–12).

to vacuum cleaners, the study of microbiology was also
being transformed by machines. Two instruments had
exceptional impact: The electron microscope revealed the
internal structure of cells (Chapter 2), and the ultracentrifuge enabled isolation of subcellular parts (Chapter 3).
The electron microscope. In the 1920s, at the Technical
University in Berlin, student Ernst Ruska (1906–1988)
was invited to develop an instrument for focusing rays of
electrons. Ruska recalled, from his childhood, that his
father’s microscope could magnify fascinating specimens
of plants and animals, but that its resolution was limited
by the wavelength of light. He was eager to devise lenses
that could focus beams of electrons, with wavelengths far
smaller than that of light, to reveal living details never seen
before. Ultimately, Ruska built lenses to focus electrons
using specially designed electromagnets. Magnetic lenses
were used to complete the fi rst electron microscope in
1933 (Fig. 1.29). Early transmission electron microscopes
achieved about tenfold greater magnification than the light
microscope, revealing details such as the ridged shell of a
diatom. Further development steadily increased magnification, to as high as a millionfold.
For the first time, cells were seen to be composed of a
cytoplasm containing macromolecules and bounded by a
phospholipid membrane. For example, the electron micrograph in Figure 1.30 shows a “thin section” of the photosynthetic bacterium Chlorobium, including its nucleoid

Cell Membranes and Macromolecules

In 1900, the study of cell structure was still limited by
the limited resolution of the light microscope and by the
absence of tools that could take apart cells to isolate their
components. Both of these limitations were overcome by
the invention of powerful instruments. Just as society was
being transformed by machines ranging from jet airplanes

(DNA) and its light-harvesting chlorosomes. Electron
microscopy is discussed further in Chapter 2.
Subcellular structures, however, raised many
questions about cell function that visualization
alone could not answer. Biochemists showed
that cell function involves numerous chemical transformations mediated by enzymes.
A milestone in the study of metabolism was
the elucidation by German biochemist Hans
Krebs (1900–1981) of the tricarboxylic acid
cycle (TCA cycle, or Krebs cycle), by which
the products of sugar digestion are converted
to carbon dioxide. The TCA cycle provides
energy for many bacteria and for the mitochondria of eukaryotes. But even Krebs understood
little of how metabolism is organized within a cell;
he and his contemporaries considered the cell a “bag
of enzymes.” The full understanding of cell structure
required experiments on isolated parts of cells.
The ultracentrifuge. Centrifugation can separate whole

cells from the fluid in which they are suspended. The fi rst
centrifuges spun samples in a rotor with centrifugal force
of a few thousand times that of gravity. In the nineteenth
century, biochemists proposed that even greater centrifugal
forces could separate components of lysed cells, even macromolecules such as proteins. The Swedish chemist Theodor Svedberg (1884–1971), at the University of Uppsala,
built such a machine: the ultracentrifuge. By the twentieth
century, ultracentrifuges achieved rates so high that they
required a vacuum to avoid burning up like a space reentry
vehicle. Ultracentrifuges isolated protein complexes such as
ribosomes, and DNA molecules such as plasmids.
Experiments combining electron microscopy and ultracentrifugation revealed how membranes govern energy
transduction within bacteria and within organelles such as
mitochondria and chloroplasts. In the 1960s, English biochemists Peter Mitchell (1920–1992) and Jennifer Moyle
proposed and tested a revolutionary idea called the chemiosmotic theory. The chemiosmotic theory states that the
reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions of the electron transport system store energy in the form of a gradient of protons
(hydrogen ions) across a membrane, such as the bacterial
cell membrane or the inner membrane of the mitochondrion. The energy stored in the proton gradient, in turn,
drives the synthesis of ATP (discussed in Chapter 14).

Microbial Genetics Leads

early twentieth century, a largely separate line of research

revealed patterns of heredity of cell traits. In eukaryotes,
the Mendelian rules of inheritance were rediscovered and
connected to the behavior of subcellular structures called
chromosomes. Frederick Griffith (1879–1941) showed in
1928 that an unknown substance from dead bacteria could
carry genetic information into living cells, transforming
harmless bacteria into a strain capable of killing mice—
a process called transformation. Some kind of “genetic
material” must be inherited to direct the expression of
inherited traits, but no one knew what that material was or
how its information was expressed.
Then, in 1944, Oswald Avery (1877–1955) and colleagues showed that the genetic material for transformation is deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA. An obscure acidic
polymer, DNA had been previously thought too uniform
in structure to carry information; its precise structure was
unknown. As World War II raged among nations, scientists
embarked on an epic struggle: the quest for the structure
of DNA.
The double helix. The tool of choice to discover the structure of molecules was X-ray crystallography, a method
developed by British physicists in the early 1900s. The field
of X-ray analysis included an unusual number of women,
including Dorothy Hodgkin (1910–1994), who later won
a Nobel Prize for the structures of penicillin and vitamin
B12. In 1953, crystallographer Rosalind Franklin joined a
laboratory at King’s College London to study the structure

of DNA (Fig. 1.31A). As a woman and as a Jew who supported relief work in Palestine, Franklin felt socially isolated
at the male-dominated Protestant university; her work was
disparagingly called “witchcraft.” Nevertheless, her exceptional X-ray micrographs (Fig. 1.31B) revealed for the fi rst
time that the standard B-form DNA was a double helix.
Without Franklin’s knowledge, her colleague Maurice
Wilkins showed her data to a competitor, James Watson
at the University of Cambridge. The pattern led Watson
and Francis Crick (1916–2004) to guess that the four
A.

bases of the DNA “alphabet” were paired in the interior
of Franklin’s double helix (Fig. 1.31C). They published
their model in the journal Nature, while denying that they
had used Franklin’s data. The discovery of the double helix
earned Watson, Crick, and Wilkins the 1962 Nobel Prize
in Physiology or Medicine. Franklin died of ovarian cancer
before the prize was awarded. Before her death, however,
she had turned her efforts to the structure of ribonucleic
acid (RNA). She determined the helical form of the RNA
chromosome within tobacco mosaic virus, the first viral
RNA to be characterized.
Modern X-ray crystallography (discussed in Chapter 2)
reveals with atomic precision the structure of DNA, including its complementary base pairs (Fig. 1.32A). The complementary pairing of DNA bases led to the development of
techniques for DNA sequencing, the reading of a sequence
of DNA base pairs. Figure 1.32B shows a portion of the

DNA sequence from bacterial DNA isolated by an undergraduate student. (The sequencing process is described in
Chapter 7.) In the data, each color represents a fluorescent
signal from one of the four bases (adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine). Each peak represents a DNA fragment
terminating in that particular base. The order of fragment
lengths yields the sequence of bases in one strand. Reading
the DNA sequence enabled microbiologists to determine
the beginning and endpoint of microbial genes, and ultimately entire genomes, as discussed in Section 1.1.
Reading the genomes enabled microbiologists to see the
history of microbial evolution, reaching back to a time even
before the advent of DNA—to a pre-DNA world when the
cell’s chromosomes were actually composed of ribonucleic
acid, RNA. This hypothetical world without DNA is called
the RNA world. How did life function in the RNA world?
We hypothesize that cells used RNA for all the functions of
DNA and protein, including information storage and replication, and biochemical catalysis. RNA molecules capable
of catalysis, called ribozymes, were discovered in 1982 by
Thomas Cech at the University of Colorado, and Sidney
Altman at Harvard University, who earned the Nobel Prize
in Chemistry in 1989. That same year, Jennifer Doudna
and Jack Szostak at Harvard showed how an RNA molecule, a self-splicing intron from Tetrahymena, could catalyze its own replication (Fig. 1.33). In 2009, Gerald Joyce
and Tracey Lincoln at the Scripps Research Institute constructed the first self-replicating ribozyme, an RNA that
can catalyze reactions and copy itself indefinitely. These

achievements support the theory that early organisms were
composed primarily of RNA.
How do DNA and RNA sequences convey information
in the cell? To read the DNA language required deciphering the genetic code—how triplets of DNA “letters” specify the amino acid units of proteins. This story is discussed
in Chapter 8.
The DNA revolution began with bacteria. What amazed
the world about DNA was that such a simple substance,
composed of only four types of subunits, is the genetic
material that determines all the different organisms on
Earth. The promise of this insight was fi rst fulfi lled in bacteria and bacteriophages, whose small genomes and short
generation times made key experiments possible (see Chapters 7–9). Bacterial tools were later extended to animals and
plants; for example:


Bacteria readily recombine DNA from unrelated
organisms. The mechanisms of bacterial recombination
led to construction of artificially recombinant DNA, or
“gene cloning.” Recombinant DNA ultimately enabled
us to transfer genes between the genomes of virtually all
types of organisms.



Bacterial DNA polymerases are used for polymerase
chain reaction (PCR) amplification of DNA. A hot
spring in Yellowstone National Park yielded the bacterium
Thermus aquaticus, whose DNA polymerase could survive many rounds of cycling to near-boiling temperature.

THE MICROBIAL CELL

The Taq polymerase formed the basis of a multibilliondollar industry of PCR amplification of DNA, with
applications ranging from genome sequencing to forensic identification.


Gene regulation discovered in bacteria provided
models for animals and plants. The fi rst key discoveries of gene expression were made in bacteria and bacteriophages. Regulatory DNA-binding proteins were
discovered in bacteria and then subsequently found in all
classes of living organisms.

In the 1970s, when the DNA revolution began, its
implications drew public concern. The use of recombinant
DNA to make hybrid organisms—organisms combining
DNA from more than one species—seemed “unnatural.”
We now know that in natural environments, genes frequently move between species. Furthermore, recombinant
DNA technology raised the specter of placing deadly genes
that produce toxins such as botulin into innocuous humanassociated bacteria such as E. coli.
The unknown consequences of recombinant DNA so
concerned molecular biologists that in 1975 they held a
conference to assess the dangers and restrict experimentation on recombinant DNA. The conference, led by Paul
Berg and Maxine Singer at Asilomar (Pacific Grove, California) was possibly the first time in history that a group
of scientists organized and agreed to regulate and restrict
their own field.
On the positive side, the emerging world of molecular biology excited the imagination of young scientists
and entrepreneurs. The pioneering biotechnology company Genentech was founded in 1976 by Robert Swanson and bacterial geneticist Robert Boyer, from UC San
Francisco. Growing numbers of students entered the field

of molecular biology, seeking to invent medical cures—or
even to clone dinosaurs, as in Michael Crichton’s novel and
film Jurassic Park (1993). While the idea of cloning a dinosaur remains science fiction, the tools of microbial genetics
opened a window into the past by letting us read the DNA
of long-dead organisms preserved in museums.

Thought Question

1.9 Do you think engineered strains of bacteria should be
patentable? What about sequenced genes or genomes?

Microbial Discoveries Transform
Medicine and Industry

Twentieth-century microbiology transformed the practice
of medicine and generated entire new industries of biotechnology and bioremediation. Following the discovery
of penicillin, Americans poured millions of dollars of private and public funds into medical research. The March of
Dimes campaign for private donations to prevent polio led
to the successful development of a vaccine that has nearly
eliminated the disease. Since then, research on microbes
and other aspects of biology has grown with support from
U.S. government agencies, such as the National Institutes
of Health and the National Science Foundation, as well
as from governments of other countries, particularly the
European nations and Japan. Further support comes from
private foundations, such as the Pasteur Institute, the Wellcome Trust, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.
Medical research generates astonishing advances, such as
the use of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the cause

Research in microbiology includes fields as diverse
as medicine and space science (Table 1.3). (A scientist whose career combines medicine and space science

Chapter 16) use bacteria to clone and produce therapeutic proteins, such as insulin for diabetics. Recombinant
viruses make safer vaccines. At the frontiers of science, we
use microbes for “synthetic biology,” the construction of
novel organisms with useful functions (see Chapter 12).
For example, synthetic biology may design bacteria with an
on/off switch to report the presence of arsenic in environmental samples. On a global level, the management of our

Concluding Thoughts
Advances in microbial science raise important questions for
society. How can medical research control emerging diseases? How do microbes contribute to global cycles of carbon and nitrogen? How can microbial metabolism clean
up polluted environments, such as the vast oil spill from
the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon wellhead in 2010?
How can we engineer viruses to treat human diseases?
This book explores the current explosion of knowledge
about microbial cells, genetics, and ecology. We introduce the applications of microbial science to human affairs,
from medical microbiology to environmental science. Most
important, we discuss research methods—how scientists
make the discoveries that will shape tomorrow’s view of
microbiology. Chapter 2 presents the imaging tools that
make possible our increasingly detailed view of the structures of cells (Chapter 3) and viruses (Chapter 6). Chapters 4 and 5 introduce microbial nutrition and growth in
diverse habitats, including what we discover from microbial
genomes. Throughout, we invite readers to share with us
the excitement of discovery in microbiology.

frozen-hydrated (rather than chemically fixed and dehydrated as in
traditional EM), authentic molecular details are preserved.
This allows us to visualize all the large macromolecular
complexes, such as cell walls, cytoskeletal filaments, DNA
aggregates, and flagellar motors, with unprecedented clarity. We have seen how bacterial cells are not simply “bags
of enzymes,” but rather highly organized and finely tuned
machines.

The biggest opportunity I see today is correlating light and

quick-freeze the cell, transfer the specimen into an electron microscope, and record a 3D image of the same cell at

PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

How did people first see microbes? As we saw in Chapter 1,
the microscope of Antonie van Leeuwenhoek first revealed
the tiny life-forms on his teeth; his superior lenses were
key to his success. Since the time of Leeuwenhoek, microscopists have devised ever-more-powerful instruments to
search for microbes in familiar and unexpected habitats.
An example of such a habitat is the interior of a human cell
exploited by Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular pathogen (Fig. 2.1). C. trachomatis causes sexually transmitted infections that may escape the patient’s notice until
they cause infertility. Intracellular chlamydias also escape the
immune response—but electron microscopy catches them
in the act. The scanning electron micrograph of Figure 2.1
images an infected cell sliced open. There, the chlamydias
multiply within a membrane vesicle that takes up much of
the human host cell. Protected from cell defenses, chlamydias fission and form “elementary bodies” that are inactive but
carry infection to a new cell. The electron micrograph shows
numerous progeny chlamydias protected by the vesicle.
What does this protective compartment look like, and
how does it form? In the Current Research Highlight,
we saw how Grant Jensen’s advanced technique of cryoEM tomography reveals the contours of an environmental

Observing Microbes

Most microbes are too small to be seen; that is, they are microscopic, requiring the use of a microscope to be seen. But why
can’t we see microbes without magnification? The answer is
surprisingly complex. In fact, our definition of “microscopic”
is based on the properties of our eyes. We define what is visible and what is microscopic in terms of the human eye.

tomography, a number of digital “slices” through the sample are assembled by computer to form a 3D model. The
ameba provides clues to the process of human chlamydial infection. The computer-generated model shows how
Simkania’s own envelope (inner and outer membranes) is
enclosed by host cell membranes. The pathogen remodels
the host intracellular membranes to protect itself from host
defenses. To investigate the function of environmental and
medical microbes, we present scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and cryo-EM tomography in Section 2.6.
First in Chapter 2, we present light microscopy, and the
theory and practice of observing microbes, which are essential for every student and professional in the field or clinic.
We then explore exciting advanced tools for research. Fluorescence and super-resolution imaging, electron microscopy, and scanning probe microscopy push ever farther the
frontiers of the unseen. And we continue to invent new
kinds of microscopy, such as chemical imaging microscopy,
to reveal microbial metabolism at work.

What determines the smallest object we can see? The size at
which objects become visible depends on the eye’s ability to
resolve detail. Resolution is the smallest distance between
two objects that allows us to see them as separate objects.
The eyes of humans and other animals observe an object by
focusing its image on a retina packed with light-absorbing
photoreceptor cells (Fig. 2.2 ). The image appears sharp,
in focus, if the eye’s lens and cornea bend all the light rays
from each point of the object to converge at one point on
the retina. Nearby points are then resolved as separate.
In the human eye, the finest resolution of two separate
points is perceived by the fovea, the portion of the retina
where the photoreceptors are packed at the highest density. The foveal photoreceptors are cone cells, which detect
primary colors (red, green, or blue) and finely resolved
detail. A group of cones with their linked neurons forms
one unit of detection, comparable to a pixel on a computer screen. The distance between two foveal “pixels”

(groups of cones with neurons) limits our resolution to
100–200 micrometers (μm)—that is, one- or two-tenths
of a millimeter. So, a tenth of a millimeter is about the
smallest object that most of us can see (resolve distinctly)
without a magnifier.
What if our eyes were formed differently? The retinas of eagles have cones packed more closely than ours,
so an eagle can resolve objects eight times as small (or
eight times as far away) as a human can; hence, the phrase
“eagle-eyed” means “sharp-sighted.” On the other hand,
insect compound eyes have photoreceptors farther apart
than ours, so insect eyes have poorer resolution. The best
they can do is resolve objects 100-fold larger than those
we can resolve. If a science-fictional giant ameba had eyes
with photoreceptors 2 meters apart, it would perceive
humans as “microscopic.”

Resolution Differs from Detection

Can we detect the presence of objects whose size we cannot resolve? Yes, we can detect their presence as a group.
For example, our eyes can detect a large population of
microbes, such as a spot of mold on a piece of bread (about
a million cells) or a cloudy tube of bacteria in liquid culture
(a million cells per milliliter) (Fig. 2.3A). Detection, the
ability to determine the presence of an object, differs from
resolution. When the unaided eye detects the presence of
mold or bacteria, it cannot resolve distinct cells.
To resolve most kinds of microbial cells, our eyes need
assistance—that is, magnification. Magnification reveals
the shapes of individual bacteria such as the wetland phototroph Rhodospirillum rubrum (Fig. 2.3B). Magnifying an
object means increasing the object’s apparent dimensions.
As the distance increases between points of detail, our eyes
can now resolve the object’s shape as a magnified image.

Thought Question
B.

In this book, we use standard metric units for size:

1 millimeter (mm)

= one-thousandth of a meter (m) = 10 –3 m

1 micrometer (µm) = one-thousandth of a millimeter = 10 –6 m
1 nanometer (nm)

= one-thousandth of a micrometer = 10 –9 m

1 picometer (pm)

= one-thousandth of a nanometer = 10 –12 m

Some authors still use the traditional unit angstrom (Å), which
equals a tenth of a nanometer, or 10 –10 meter.

microscopy. Note that with bright-field light microscopy,
the cell shape is just discernible under the highest power.
With scanning electron microscopy, cell shapes appear in
greater detail (higher resolution).
Certain shapes of bacteria are common to many taxonomic groups. For example, both bacteria and archaea form
similarly shaped rods, or bacilli (singular, bacillus), and
cocci (spheres; singular, coccus), as shown in Figure 2.6.
Thus, rods and spherical shapes evolved independently
within different taxa. In contrast, a unique bacterial shape
that evolved in only one taxon is the spirochete, a
tightly coiled spiral. Species of spirochetes cause
diseases such as syphilis and Lyme disease.

Section 18.6.) A different, unrelated spiral form
is the “spirillum” (plural, spirilla), a wide, rigid spiral cell that is similar to a rod-shaped bacillus.

Note:
Relative sizes of different cells.

Microbial Size and Shape

Different kinds of microbes differ in size, over a range of
several orders of magnitude, or powers of ten (Fig. 2.4).
Eukaryotic microbes are found across the full range of cell
size, from photosynthetic picoeukaryotes abundant in the
oceans (0.2–2.0 μm) to giant amebas that reach nearly a
centimeter (discussed in Chapter 20). Within a eukaryotic
cell larger than 5 μm, a typical student’s light microscope
may resolve intracellular compartments such as the nucleus
and vacuoles containing digested food (Fig. 2.5). Protists show complex shapes and appendages. For example,
an ameba from an aquatic ecosystem shows a large nucleus
and pseudopods to engulf prey (Fig. 2.5A). Pseudopods
can be seen moving by the streaming of their cytoplasm.
Another protist readily observed by light microscopy is Trypanosoma brucei, an insect-borne blood parasite that causes
African sleeping sickness (Fig. 2.5B). In the trypanosome,
we observe a nucleus and a flagellum. Eukaryotic flagella
propel the cell by a whiplike action. For more on microbial
eukaryotes, see Chapter 20.
The most commonly studied prokaryotes (bacteria and
archaea) are smaller than 10 μm. Their overall shape can
be seen, but most of their internal structures (discussed
in Chapter 3) are too small to resolve by light microscopy.
Figure 2.6 shows some common cell shapes of bacteria,

Microscopy for Different Size Scales

To resolve microbes and microbial structures of different
sizes requires different kinds of microscopes. Figure 2.7

can be resolved under a light microscope, but an individual ribosome (20 nm in diameter) requires electron
microscopy.




Light microscopy (LM) resolves images of individual
bacteria by their absorption of light. The specimen is
commonly viewed as a dark object against a light-fi lled
field, or background; this is called bright-field microscopy (seen in Fig. 2.7A and B). Advanced techniques,
based on special properties of light, include fluorescence,
dark-field, and phase-contrast microscopy.
Electron microscopy (EM) uses beams of electrons to
resolve details several orders of magnitude smaller than
those seen under light microscopy. In scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the electron beam is scattered
from the metal-coated surface of an object, generating
an appearance of 3D depth. In transmission electron
microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2.7C and D), the electron
beam travels through the object, where the electrons are
absorbed by an electron-dense metal stain.



Atomic force microscopy (AFM) uses intermolecular
forces between a probe and an object to map the 3D
topography of a cell, or of cell parts.



X-ray crystallography detects the interference pattern
of X-rays entering the crystal lattice of a molecule. From
the interference pattern, researchers build a computational model of the structure of the individual molecule,
such as a protein or a nucleic acid, or even a molecular
complex such as a ribosome (Fig. 2.7E).

To Summarize












Detection is the ability to determine the presence of an
object.
Resolution is the smallest distance by which two objects
can be separated and still be distinguished as separate.
Magnification is an increase in the apparent size of an

Eukaryotic microbes may be large enough to resolve
subcellular structures under a light microscope. Other
eukaryotic cells are as small as bacteria.
Bacteria and archaea are generally too small for subcellular resolution by a light microscope. Their shapes
include characteristic forms such as rods and cocci.
Different kinds of microscopy resolve cells and subcellular structures of different sizes. Chemical imaging

2.2

Optics and Properties
of Light

How do light rays magnify an image? Light microscopy
directly extends the lens system of our own eyes. Light is part
of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation (Fig. 2.8), a
form of energy propagated as waves that are associated with
electrical and magnetic fields. Regions of the electromagnetic spectrum are defined by wavelength, which for visible
light is about 400–750 nm. Radiation of longer wavelengths includes infrared and radio waves, whereas shorter
wavelengths include ultraviolet rays and X-rays.

Chemical Imaging Microscopy

A new class of imaging techniques known as chemical
imaging microscopy goes beyond size and shape to reveal
the chemical composition of the microbial object. These
techniques apply mass spectroscopy to a microscopic object.
The object, such as a microbe, is bombarded with a beam of
ions that vaporizes organic molecules from the object’s surface. The molecular fragments that come off are identified
through mass analysis. The microbe may be cultured with
heavy isotopes of an element such as carbon or nitrogen,
whose incorporation into biomass alters the mass spectra.
These imaging techniques show where in the cell different
nutrients are fixed into biomass. Special Topic 2.1 presents

Light Carries Information

All forms of electromagnetic radiation carry information
from the objects they interact with. The information carried by radiation can be used to detect objects; for example,
radar (using radio waves) detects a speeding car. All electromagnetic radiation travels through a vacuum at the same
speed: about 3 × 108 meters per second (m/s), the speed of
light. The speed of light (c) is equal to the wavelength (λ)
of the radiation multiplied by its frequency (ν), the number
of wave cycles per unit time:
c = λν

Magnification. The human retina absorbs radiation
within a range of wavelengths, 400–750 nm (0.40–
0.75 μm), which we define as visible light. But the smallest distance our retina can resolve is 150 μm, about 300
times the wavelength of light. Thus, we are unable to
access all of the information contained in the light that
enters our eyes. To use more of the information carried
within the light, we must spread the light rays apart far
enough for our retina to perceive the resolved image.

The physical behavior of light resembles in some ways a
beam of particles and in other ways a waveform. The particles of light are called “photons.” Each photon has an
associated wavelength that determines how the photon will
interact with a given object. The combined properties of
particle and wave enable light to interact with an object in
several different ways:


Wavelength (m)

photon’s energy (Fig. 2.9A ). The energy is converted

Because c is constant, the longer the wavelength λ is, the
lower the frequency ν is. Frequency is usually measured in

to or smaller than the size of the object. If the wavelength
of the radiation is larger than the object, then most of the
wave’s energy will simply pass through the object, like an
ocean wave passing around a dock post. Thus, radar, with
a wavelength of 1–100 centimeters (cm), cannot resolve
microbes, though it easily resolves cars and people.

Contrast between the object and its surroundings.
Contrast is the difference in light and dark. If an object
and its surroundings absorb or reflect radiation equally,
then the object will be undetectable. It is hard to observe
a cell of transparent cytoplasm floating in water, because
the aqueous cytoplasm and the extracellular water tend
to transmit light similarly, producing little contrast.

SPECIAL TOPIC 2.1- - Catch Your Bacteria Snacking
Light rays and electron beams offer glimpses into the astonishing world within a cell. But what are all those intriguing
knobs and tubules made of? Chemical imaging microscopy
shows more than the outline of bacteria; it shows what
they’ve been eating.
A high-resolution method for chemical imaging is called
nanoscale secondary ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS).

The imaging method starts with an ionizing probe, a source of
energy that breaks up the large organic molecules of a sample
(Fig. 1). The molecular fragments, called “secondary ions,” fly
off from the source and are captured by a mass spectrometer.
This instrument measures fragment masses of the secondary ions, generating a mass spectrum. Mass spectra are taken
from thousands of locations, scanned across a bacterial cell.

to a different form, usually heat. (That is why a live
specimen eventually “cooks” on the slide if observed for
too long.) When a microbial specimen absorbs light, it
can be observed as a dark spot against a bright field, as
in bright-field microscopy. Some molecules that absorb
light of a specific wavelength reemit energy as light with
a longer wavelength; this is called fluorescence. Fluorescence microscopy is discussed in Section 2.4.


Reflection means that the wavefront redirects from the
surface of an object at an angle equal to its incident angle

(Fig. 2.9B). Reflection of light waves is analogous to the
reflection of water waves. Reflection from a silvered mirror or a glass surface is used in the optics of microscopy.


Refraction means that light bends as it enters a substance that slows its speed (Fig. 2.9C). Such a substance
is said to be refractive and, by definition, has a higher
refractive index than air. Refraction is the key property
that enables a lens to magnify an image.

food we consume? Our intestinal epithelium secretes a mucus
layer, which helps prevent colonization by pathogens. But the
mucus also “farms” bacteria, whose feeding helps moderate
the buildup of secretions.
Wagner’s group used different types of bacteria to colonize gnotobiotic (germ-free) mice. The mice were injected
intravenously with a nutrient (the amino acid threonine) containing the heavy-atom isotopes 13C and 15N. The threonine
is readily incorporated into mouse proteins and secretions,
but the bacteria inoculated into the mouse’s intestinal lumen
have no direct access to the threonine, only to mouse secretions containing it. Thus, NanoSIMS of the intestinal bacteria
reveals which ones are snacking on mucus.
In Figure 1B, various bacteria on the mouse epithelium
are identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH,
discussed in Chapter 21). The FISH technique uses short
species-specific nucleic acid probes to hybridize to the ribosomal RNA of different bacteria. In the FISH panel shown,
the fluorescent probes identify single cells of Bacteroides
acidifaciens (blue) and Ruminococcaceae OTU_5807 (red).
The parallel panels show the atomic percent (at%) of the
given isotopes 15N and 13C, imaged on a color scale quantifying the amount of isotope enrichment. The panels show that
most of the bacterial cells corresponding to B. acidifaciens
and Ruminococcaceae acquire nitrogen from the host (gold
or yellow color, white arrowhead). The third panel shows
that some but not all of the bacteria show carbon uptake.
Overall, out of the mixed gut microbes, the B. acidifaciens



Scattering means that a portion of the wavefront is converted to a spherical wave originating from the object
(Fig. 2.9D). If a large number of particles simultaneously scatter light, we see a haze—for example, the haze
of bacteria suspended in a culture tube. Special optical
arrangements (such as dark-field microscopy, discussed
in Section 2.5) can use scattered light to detect (but not
resolve) microbial shapes smaller than the wavelength
of light.

FREDERIK SCHULZ, UNIVERSITÄT WIEN

What information does NanoSIMS yield? Different kinds
of isotope labeling can focus on specific chemical questions. For example, the cell’s uptake of nitrogen-rich protein can be detected by incorporation of the heavy isotope
15
N. The increased weight of 15N compared to the normally
predominant 14N (as indicated by the mass ratio 15N/14N) is
detected quantitatively in the molecular fragment masses.
Alternatively, we can detect isotopes of carbon (13C/12C).
At the University of Vienna, Michael Wagner and colleagues
(Fig. 2) used NanoSIMS to address the question: Which of our
intestinal bacteria feed on our own secretions, instead of the

and Ruminococcaceae strains were shown to be the main
snackers on host mucus. These observations will help medical researchers characterize the composition and dynamics
of a healthy gut microbiome.

RESEARCH QUESTION
The number of Bacteroides foraging on host secretions
changes when other species are introduced. Why might this
happen? Can you propose an experiment using NanoSIMS to
test your hypothesis?

Magnification by a Lens

Magnification requires the bending of light rays, as in
refraction. As a wavefront of light enters a refractive material, such as glass, the region of the wave that first reaches
the material is slowed, while the rest of the wave continues
at its original speed until it also passes into the refractive
material (Fig. 2.10A
). As the entire wavefront continues through the refractive material, its path continues,
bent at an angle from its original direction.

Thought Question

2.3 Explain what happens to the refracted light wave as it

emerges from a piece of glass of even thickness. How do its
new speed and direction compare with its original (incident)
speed and direction?

How does refraction accomplish magnification? Refraction magnifies an image when light passes through a
refractive material shaped so as to spread its rays. One
shape that spreads light rays is a parabolic curve. When
light rays enter a lens of refractive material with a parabolic

surface (Fig. 2.10B), parallel rays each bend at an angle
such that all of the rays meet at a certain point, called
the focal point. From the focal point behind the lens,
the light rays continue, spreading out with an expanding
wavefront. This expansion magnifies the image carried by
the wave. The distance from the lens to the focal point
(called the focal distance) is determined by the degree of
curvature of the lens, and by the refractive index of its
material.
In Figure 2.11 , the object under observation is
placed near the focal point (F) in front of a lens. The light
rays trace a path opposite to that of Figure 2.10B. The

The eye perceives the expanded light
rays as a virtual image—that is, an
image that appears to represent a much
larger object farther away. The expansion of light rays, or magnification,
increases the distances between points
of the image. The details of the magnified image become larger than the spacing of photoreceptor units in the retina.
Thus, our eye can perceive details that
the unaided eye cannot see.

The wavelength of the radiation must be equal to or
smaller than the size of the object for a microscope to
resolve the object’s shape.

Low-power magnification (10!)

Absorption means that the energy from light (or other
electromagnetic radiation) is acquired by the object.
Reflection means that the wavefront bounces off the
surface of a particle at an angle equal to its incident
angle. Scattering means that a wavefront interacts with
an object of smaller dimension than the wavelength.
Light scattering enables the detection of objects whose
detail cannot be resolved.

Refraction is the bending of light as it enters a substance that slows its speed. Refraction through a curved
lens magnifies an image, enlarging its details beyond
the spacing between our eye’s photoreceptors.

Interference between wavefronts converts a point source

Bright-Field Microscopy

The most common kind of light microscopy is called
bright-field microscopy, in which an object such as a bacterial cell is perceived as a dark silhouette blocking the
passage of light (for examples, see Fig. 2.6A, C, and E).
Details of the object are defined by the points of light surrounding its edge. Here we explain how a typical student’s
microscope works, and how to use it to image microbes.

Magnification

How do the optics of a bright-field microscope maximize
the observation of detail? We consider the following factors:


Wavelength and resolution. Our eyes can resolve a distance as small as 100–200 μm, while the resolution limit
from the wavelength of light is 200 nm (0.2 μm)—that
is, 500- to 1,000-fold smaller. Thus, the greatest magnification that can improve our perception of detail is
about 1,000×. Any greater magnification expands the
image size, but the width of the image peaks expands
without resolution (see Fig. 2.12). As we noted in the
previous section, this expansion without increasing resolution is called empty magnification.



Light and contrast. For any given lens system, a balanced amount of light yields the highest contrast
between the dark specimen and the light background.
High contrast is needed to perceive the full resolution at
a given magnification.

Poorly resolved

θ = Angle of aperture

Numerical aperture and resolution. The
numerical aperture (NA) equals the refractive index (n) of the
medium containing the light cone, multiplied by the sine of the angle
of the light cone (θ). Higher NA allows greater resolution.





Lens quality. All lenses contain inherent aberrations
that detract from perfect curvature. Optical properties
limit the perfection of a single lens, but manufacturers construct microscopes with a series of lenses that
multiply each other’s magnification and correct for
aberrations.

Let’s first consider magnification of an image by a single lens. Figure 2.13 shows an objective lens, a lens situated directly above an object or specimen that we wish to
observe at high resolution. How can we maximize the resolution of details?
An object at the focal point of a lens sits at the tip of a
cone of light formed by rays from the lens converging at
the object. The angle of the light cone is determined by
the curvature and refractive index of the lens. The lens
fills an aperture, or hole, for the passage of light; and
for a given lens the light cone is defined by an angle θ
(theta) projecting from the midline, known as the angle
of aperture. As θ increases and the horizontal width
of the light cone (sin θ) increases, a wider cone of light
passes through the specimen. The wider the cone of light

CHAPTER 2

rays, the less the interference between wavefronts—and
the narrower the peak intensities in the image. Thus, a
wider light cone allows us to resolve smaller details. The
greater the angle of aperture of the lens (sin θ), the better the resolution.
Resolution also depends on the refractive index of the
medium that contains the light cone, which is usually air.
The refractive index (n) is the ratio of the speed of light
in a vacuum to its speed in another medium. For air, n is
extremely close to 1. For water, n = 1.33; for lens material, n ranges from 1.4 to 1.6. As light passing through air
or water enters a lens of higher refractive index, the light
bends, at angles up to a maximum (θ). The product of the
refractive index (n) of the medium multiplied by sin θ is the
numerical aperture (NA):
NA = n sin θ
In Figure 2.13 we see the calculation of NA for an
objective lens of magnification 10×, and for a lens of magnification 100×. As NA increases, the peak intensities of an
image narrow and the distance between two objects that
can be resolved decreases. The minimum resolution distance R varies inversely with NA:
λ NA
R = __
2

where λ represents the wavelength of incident light. Notice
that this equation limits resolution to approximately half
the wavelength of light (λ/2).
As the lens strength increases and the light cone widens, the lens must come nearer the object. Defects in
lens curvature become more of a problem, and focusing
becomes more challenging. As θ becomes very wide, too
much of the light from the object is lost from refraction at
the glass-to-air interface. To collect and focus more light,
we need to increase the refractive index of the medium

between the object and the objective lens (air, as shown
so far). For the highest-power objective lens, generally
100×, a zone of constant refractive index is maintained
by replacing air with immersion oil between the object
and the lens. Immersion oil has a refractive index comparable to that of the lens (n = 1.5) (Fig. 2.14). Immersion oil minimizes the loss of light rays by refraction and
makes it possible to reach 100× magnification with minimal distortion. In a two-lens system, 100× objective is
multiplied by 10× ocular magnification to yield 1,000×
total magnification.

Thought Question

2.4 (refer to Fig. 2.13) For a single lens, what angle θ might

offer magnification even greater than 100X? What practical
problem would you have in designing such a lens to generate
this light cone?

The Compound Microscope

A compound microscope is a system of multiple lenses
designed to correct or compensate for lens aberrations
(deviations from perfect curvature). Why do we use a compound microscope instead of a single perfect lens? The
manufacture of high-power lenses is difficult because as the
glass curvature increases, the effects of aberration increase
faster than the magnification. Instead of one thick lens,
a series of lower-power lenses can multiply their magnification with minimal aberration. Figure 2.15
shows a
typical arrangement of a compound microscope: the light
source is placed at the bottom, shining upward through
a series of lenses, including the condenser, objective, and
ocular lenses.
Between the light source and the condenser sits a diaphragm, a device to cut the diameter of the light column.
Lower-power lenses require lower light levels because the
excess light makes it impossible to observe the darkening
effect of specimen absorbance. This difference between
the dark (absorbing) specimen and the bright (transparent) field is called contrast. Higher-power lenses spread the
light rays farther and thus require an open diaphragm to
collect sufficient light for contrast.
Above the diaphragm, the condenser consists of one
or more lenses that collect a beam of rays from the light
source onto a small area of the slide, where light may be
absorbed by the object or specimen. Condenser lenses
increase light available for contrast but do not participate in magnification. The objective lens is the first to
form a magnified image (I) of the object (Fig. 2.15A).
As the image forms, each light ray traces a path toward
a position opposite its point of origin; thus, the image is

mirror-reversed. Keep this mirror reversal in mind when
exploring a field of cells.
The first image of the object (I) is then amplified by
a secondary magnification step through the ocular lens
within the eyepiece. The final image (I') is comparable
to the virtual image of Figure 2.11, but I' includes the
total magnification of the object by objective times ocular
lenses. The magnification factor of the ocular lens is multiplied by the magnification factor of the objective lens to
generate the total magnification (power). For example, a
10× ocular multiplied by a 40× objective generates 400×
total magnification.
The nosepiece of a compound microscope typically
holds three or four objective lenses of different magnifying power, such as 4×, 10×, 40×, and 100× (requiring
immersion oil). These lenses are arranged so as to rotate
in turn into the optical column. In a high-quality instrument the lenses are set at different heights from the slide
so as to be parfocal. In a parfocal system, when an object
is focused with one lens, it remains in focus, or nearly so,
when another lens is rotated to replace the first.

Note:

Objective lenses can be obtained in several different
grades of quality, manufactured with different kinds of correction
for aberrations. Lenses should feature at minimum the following
corrections: “plan” correction for field curvature, to generate a
field that appears flat; and “apochromat” correction for spherical
and chromatic aberrations.

Observing a specimen under a compound microscope
requires several steps:


Position the specimen centrally in the optical column.
Only a small area of a slide can be visualized within the
field of view of a given lens. The higher the magnification, the smaller the field of view that will be seen.



Optimize the amount of light. At lower power, too
much light will wash out the light absorption of the
specimen. At higher power, more light needs to be
collected, lest everything appear dark. To optimize light,
the condenser must be set at the correct vertical position
to focus on the specimen, and the diaphragm must be
adjusted to transmit the amount of light that produces
the best contrast.

CHAPTER 2

Focus the objective lens. The focusing knob
permits adjustment of the focal distance
between the objective lens and the specimen
on the slide so as to bring the specimen into
the focal plane, the plane that contains the
focal points for light entering the lens from
all directions. Typically, we focus first using
a low-power objective, which generates a
greater depth of field—that is, a range of
planes in which the object appears in or near
focus. After focusing under low power, we
can rotate a higher-power lens into view and
then fine-tune the adjustment.

appears sharp, with a bright line along its edge. A helical
cell such as R. rubrum shows well-focused segments alternating with hazier segments that are too close to the lens
(Fig. 2.16B). When the cell swims too far past the focal
plane, the bright interference lines collapse into the
object’s silhouette, which now appears bright or
“hollow,” or surrounded by rings (Fig. 2.16C).
H3C
In fact, the bacterium is not hollow at all; only
its image has changed.
When the cell extends across several focal planes,
different portions appear out of focus (either too near or
too far from the lens). In addition, when the end of a
cell points toward the observer, light travels through the
length of the cell before reaching the observer, so the
cell absorbs more light and appears dark (Fig. 2.16D).
Motile bacteria swimming in and out of the focal plane
present a challenge even to experienced microscopists.
The higher the magnification, the narrower the depth
of the focal plane; thus, observing swimming organisms
requires a trade-off between magnification and depth of
field.

Thought Question

2.5 Under starvation, a bacterium such as Bacillus thuringi-

ensis, the biological insecticide, packages its cytoplasm into
a spore, leaving behind an empty cell wall. Suppose, under a
microscope, you observe what appears to be a hollow cell.
How can you tell whether the cell is indeed hollow or is simply
out of focus?

Fixation and Staining Improve
Resolution and Contrast

Detection and resolution of cells under a microscope are
enhanced by fixation and staining, procedures that usually kill the cell. Fixation is a process by which cells are
made to adhere to a slide in a fixed position. We can fix
cells with methanol or by heat treatment to denature the
cell’s proteins, whose exposed side chains then adhere to
the glass. A stain absorbs much of the incident light, usually over a wavelength range that results in a distinctive
color. The use of chemical stains was developed in the nineteenth century, when German chemists used organic synthesis to invent new coloring agents for clothing. Clothing
was made of natural fibers such as cotton or wool, so a substance that dyed clothing would be likely to react with biological specimens.
How do stains work? Most stain molecules contain conjugated double bonds or aromatic rings that absorb visible
light (Fig. 2.18) and one or more positive charges, such as

phosphoryl groups on membrane phospholipids (discussed
in Section 3.2). The positively charged groups react with
negatively charged groups in the bacterial cell envelope.
Different stains vary with respect to the strength of their
binding and the degree of binding to different parts of
a cell.
Simple stains. A simple stain adds dark color specifically

to cells, but not to the external medium or surrounding tissue (in the case of pathological samples). The most
commonly used simple stain is methylene blue, originally
used by Robert Koch to stain bacteria (see Figs. 2.6E
and 2.7B). A typical procedure for fi xation and staining
is shown in Figure 2.19. First we fi x a drop of culture on
a slide by treating with methanol or by heating on a slide
warmer. Either treatment denatures cell proteins, exposing
side chains that bind to the glass. We then flood the slide
with methylene blue solution. The positively charged molecule binds to the negatively charged cell envelope of fi xed
bacteria. After excess stain is washed off and the slide has
been dried, we observe it under high-power magnification
using immersion oil.
Differential stains. A differential stain stains one kind
of cell but not another. The most famous differential
stain is the Gram stain, devised in 1884 by the Danish
physician Hans Christian Gram (1853–1938). Gram
fi rst used the Gram stain to distinguish pneumococcal
(Streptococcus pneumoniae) bacteria from human lung
tissue. In Figure 2.20A, Gram-stained S. pneumoniae
bacteria appear dark purple among human white blood
cells. Other species of bacteria, such as Proteus mirabilis
(a cause of urinary infections), fail to retain the purple
stain (Fig. 2.20B). Different bacterial species are classified as Gram-positive or Gram-negative, depending on
whether they retain the stain.

In the Gram stain procedure (Fig. 2.21), a dye such as
crystal violet binds to the bacteria; it also binds to the surface of human cells, but less strongly. After the excess stain
is washed off, a mordant, or binding agent, is applied. The
mordant used is iodine solution, which contains iodide ions
(I–). The iodide complexes with the positively charged crystal violet molecules trapped inside the cells. The crystal
violet–iodide complex is now held more strongly within the
cell wall. The thicker the cell wall, the more crystal violet–
iodide molecules are held.
Next, a decolorizer, ethanol, is added for a precise time
interval (typically 20 seconds). The decolorizer removes
loosely bound crystal violet–iodide, but Gram-positive cells
retain the stain tightly. The Gram-positive cells that retain
the stain appear dark purple, while the Gram-negative cells
are colorless. Timing the decolorizer step is critical because
if it lasts too long, the Gram-positive cells, too, will release
their crystal violet stain. In the final step, a counterstain,

The Gram stain. A. Gram-positive cells have

thick cell walls that retain the crystal violet stain. Gram-negative
cells have thinner cell walls, which lose the crystal violet stain but
are counterstained by safranin. B. In a Gram-positive cell, multiple
layers of peptidoglycan retain the crystal violet–iodide complex.
In a Gram-negative cell, the stain leaks out.

This process allows the visualization of
Gram-negative material, which is stained pale pink by the
safranin. Gram-positive cells also retain safranin; thus, if
the cells are decolorized too long, both Gram-positive and
Gram-negative cells will appear pink due to safranin.
How does the Gram stain distinguish different cell
types? Most Gram-negative species of bacteria possess
a cell wall that is thinner and more porous than that of
Gram-positive species (discussed in Chapter 3). A Gramnegative cell wall has only one to three layers of peptidoglycan (sugar chains cross-linked by peptides), whereas a
Gram-positive cell has five or more layers. The multiple
layers of peptidoglycan retain enough stain complex that
the cell appears purple.
The Gram stain became a key tool for identifying pathogens in the clinical laboratory. As we’ll see in Chapter 3, the
Gram stain effectively distinguishes Proteobacteria (a clade
of bacteria with a thin cell wall and an outer membrane)
from Firmicutes (bacteria with a thick cell wall and no outer
membrane.) Proteobacteria include Escherichia coli and
many related intestinal bacteria. Another important Gramnegative group is the Bacteroidetes, whose species work
with Proteobacteria to digest our food (discussed in Chapters 13 and 21).

Firmicutes such as species of Clostridium and Enterococcus. The digestive contributions of Firmicutes are less clear.
Most intestinal bacteria are mutualists; that is, they share
positive contributions with their host (the human body).
However, the gut community may be invaded by deadly
pathogens, such as Escherichia coli O157:H7, Enterococcus
faecalis, and Clostridium difficile.
Still other groups of bacteria and archaea have different kinds of cell walls that may stain Gram-positive, Gramnegative, or variable (discussed in Chapters 18 and 19).
Moreover, even Firmicutes such as Bacillus species show
variable stain results depending on their growth state and
environmental conditions.








Acid-fast stain (Ziehl-Neelsen). Carbolfuchsin specifically stains mycolic acids of Mycobacterium tuberculosis
and M. leprae, the causative agents of tuberculosis and
leprosy, respectively (Fig. 2.22A).
Spore stain. When samples are boiled with malachite
green, the stain binds specifically to the endospore coat
(Fig. 2.22B). It detects spores of Bacillus species such
as B. thuringiensis (the insecticide) and B. anthracis (the
cause of anthrax), as well as spores of Clostridium botulinum, which produces botulinum toxin.
Negative stain. A negative stain is a suspension of
opaque particles such as India ink added to darken the
surrounding medium and reveal transparent components such as the outer capsule of a pathogen (presented
in Chapter 3). Other kinds of negative stains are used for
electron microscopy (see Section 2.6).
Antibody tags. Stains linked to antibodies can identify precise strains of bacteria or even specific molecular components of cells. The antibody (which binds a
specific cell protein) is linked to a reactive enzyme for
detection, or to a fluorophore (fluorescent molecule)
for immunofluorescence microscopy (discussed next, in
Section 2.4).

To Summarize











In bright-field microscopy, image quality depends on
the wavelength of light; the magnifying power of a lens;
and the position of the focal plane, the region where the
specimen is in focus (that is, where the sharpest image is
obtained).
A compound microscope achieves magnification and
resolution through the objective and ocular lenses.
A wet mount specimen contains living microbes.
Fixing and staining a specimen kills it but improves
contrast and resolution.
The Gram stain differentiates between two major bacterial taxa, which stain either Gram-positive or Gramnegative. Eukaryotes stain negative.
Acid-fast, spore, negative, and antibody stains are
other kinds of differential stains.

2.4

Fluorescence Microscopy and
Super-Resolution Imaging

Fluorescence microscopy (also called epifluorescence
microscopy) is a powerful tool for identifying specific
kinds of microbes, such as pathogens or members of environmental communities. Fluorescence also reveals specific
cell parts at work, such as division proteins in the act of
accomplishing cell fission. The profound importance of
fluorescence for microbial discovery was acknowledged by
the awarding of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for
the discovery and development of green fluorescent protein, GFP (to Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and
Roger Tsien) and the 2014 Nobel in Chemistry for the
development of super-resolved fluorescence microscopy, or
super-resolution imaging (to Eric Betzig, Stefan Hell, and
William Moerner).
In fluorescence microscopy, the specimen absorbs light of
a defined wavelength and then emits light of lower energy,
thus longer wavelength; that is, the specimen “fluoresces.”
Some microbes, such as cyanobacteria and algae, fluoresce on
their own (autofluorescence), owing to endogenous fluorescent molecules such as chlorophyll. For other aims, specific
parts of the cell are labeled with a fluorophore, a fluorescent dye or protein. In Figure 2.23A, cells of the cyanobacterium Anabaena show autofluorescence (red) arising from
their chlorophyll. Every tenth cell or so, however, develops as
a nitrogen-fixing heterocyst that lacks chlorophyll. In Figure 2.23A, the heterocysts specifically express a nitrogenstress gene fused to a gene encoding GFP.
Fluorescence microscopy is also used by marine ecologists
to reveal tiny bacteria and plankton growing in seawater, a
highly dilute natural environment (discussed in Chapter 21).
Such observations support the study of microbial responses
to climate change. Microbes, including viruses, bacteria,
and protists, are detected by fluorescence of DNA-specific
stains such as DAPI (4', 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole). The
advantage of DAPI fluorescent stain is that it detects only
live cells whose DNA is intact, distinguishing them from
environmental debris.
For medicine, fluorescence enables detection of microbial pathogens that colonize the relatively large cells and
organ systems of the human body. Figure 2.23B shows
infection by Listeria monocytogenes, the cause of listeriosis,
a dangerous food-borne disease. In this study, the Listeria
strain was engineered with a gene expressing GFP (green
fluorescence). The bacteria (green) propel themselves
through a human cell by polymerizing “tails” of the cell’s
actin (violet, stained by an actin-specific fluorophore, phalloidin). The human cell nuclei are labeled red with DAPI.
Thus, fluorescence can visualize three different components within one microscopic field.

Excitation and Emission

How and when does a molecule fluoresce? Fluorescence
occurs when a molecule absorbs light of a specific wavelength (the excitation wavelength) that has just the right
energy needed to raise an electron to a higher-energy orbital
(Fig. 2.24). Because this higher-energy electron state is
unstable, the electron decays to an orbital of slightly lower
energy, while losing some energy as heat. The electron then
falls to its original level by emitting a photon of less energy
and longer wavelength (the emission wavelength).


The reflected blue light enters the objective lens, which
focuses it onto the specimen, where it excites fluorophores
to fluoresce green. The fluorescence emanates in all directions from the specimen (like a point source). Since the
light rays point in all directions, a small portion of the fluorescent light (green) returns through the objective lens to
reach the dichroic mirror. The green light now has a longer wavelength, above the penetration limit of the mirror,
so it continues through to the ocular lens. The ocular lens
focuses the fluorescent light onto the photodetectors of a
highly sensitive digital camera.

What determines the properties of a fluorophore? The
molecular structure of each fluorophore determines its peak
wavelengths of excitation and emission, as well as its binding properties. For example, the aromatic rings of DAPI
mimic a base pair, enabling intercalation between base
pairs of DNA (Fig. 2.26A). DAPI absorbs in the UV and
emits in the blue range. Note, however, that the computer
driving the optical system can convert the fluorescence signal to any color chosen by the microscopist; for example, in
Figure 2.23B the DAPI stain is shown red.

Originally isolated from a jellyfish, Aequorea victoria,
the Nobel-winning GFP can be expressed from a gene
spliced into the DNA of any organism; even monkeys
have been engineered to glow green. How does GFP act
as a fluorophore? The fluorophore part of GFP consists of
three amino acid residues that fuse to form an aromatic
ring structure, embedded within a beta barrel protein tube.
The properties of the fluorophore are modified by the surrounding protein, so mutation of the gene encoding GFP
generates numerous variants with different spectral ranges.
Another interesting property of GFP is that its fluorophore can ionize (labeled in Fig. 2.26B). The ionized
and protonated forms have slightly different excitation ranges, thus affording a way to measure hydronium ion concentration (pH) within a cell. This
property enables GFP to report on environmental
stress responses of bacteria.
The wide range of colors and environmental
sensitivities of GFP variants provides an extraordinary set of probes for cell structure, as we will
see in Chapter 3. For example, different fluorophores
label specific molecules during DNA replication within
a growing cell of Bacillus subtilis (Fig. 2.27B). The red

The cell specificity of the fluorophore can be determined by:







Chemical affi nity. Certain fluorophores have chemical
affi nity for certain classes of biological molecules. For
example, the fluorophore FM4-64 (green excitation, red
emission) specifically binds membranes.

cell component are chemically linked to a fluorophore
molecule. The use of antibodies linked to fluorophores
is known as immunofluorescence.
DNA hybridization. A short sequence of DNA attached
to a fluorophore will hybridize to a specific sequence
in the genome. Thus we can label one position in the
chromosome.
Gene fusion reporter. Cells can be engineered with a
gene fusion, a fused gene that expresses one of their own
bacterial proteins combined with a gene encoding GFP
or one of many variants expressing different colors.

the center of the cell, but sometimes they separate, visible
as two yellow spots.

Thought Question



OBSERVING THE MICROBIAL CELL

The emitted light travels in all directions from the point
source of the object, and its resolution is limited by
the wavelength. Thus, fluorescence cannot resolve the
detailed shape of a protein, or distinguish two proteins
that are close together. But we can detect the location of
a DNA-binding protein within a cell and resolve it as distinct from another fluorescent object located elsewhere.
Furthermore, computational techniques called super-resolution imaging enable us to pinpoint the protein’s location with a precision tenfold greater than the resolution
of ordinary optical microscopy.

A concern with the use of GFP fluorescence is that proteins fused to GFP may behave differently from the original
nonfused protein. In some cases, the GFP portion causes
fusion proteins to form complexes at the cell poles that
are absent in non-GFP cells. Thus, in cellular biology, it is
always important to confirm data with the results of a different kind of technique—for example, localization of the
target protein with a labeled antibody.
Note also in Figure 2.27B that the labeled membranes
and DNA origin appear diffuse—that is, unresolved.

Cell function requires the interaction of key single molecules, such as the chromosomal DNA with a protein binding its origin. William Moerner at Stanford University was
the first to demonstrate the possibility of single-molecule
tracking of fluorescent proteins in bacteria (Fig. 2.28).
How can we track a single molecule, which is far smaller
than the resolution limit of light (λ/2 = 200 nm)? Recall
the shape of the magnified image of a point source of light
(Fig. 2.12). Upon magnification, each image of a point
source appears as a peak intensity surrounded by rings of
much lower intensity. The sharpness of the main peak is
limited by the wavelength of light. But the precision with
which we know the peak’s central position is much narrower (Fig. 2.28A). In other words, the uncertainty of

the central peak position is about a tenth the width of the
intensity profile. Computation based on the intensity profile can reveal the peak positions with high precision. The
peak positions show how individual proteins move within a
living cell (Fig. 2.28B).
In an early application of super-resolution imaging,
Moerner worked with Lucy Shapiro at Stanford University to track the movement of DNA-binding proteins
during cell fission of Caulobacter crescentus (Fig. 2.29).
Shapiro received the National Medal of Science from
President Obama in 2013 for her studies of the intriguing
developmental cycle of this bacterium, which involves a
transition between stalked and f lagellar cells (presented
in Chapter 3). Moerner, Shapiro, and their students used
super-resolution imaging to track the migration of the
ParA cell fission protein (Fig. 2.29B and C). In this
experiment, a gene encoding ParA is fused to a gene for
yellow f luorescent protein (YFP), whereas ParB is fused
to cyan f luorescent protein (CFP). ParA migrates clear
across the cell, generating a spindle-like track to guide
ParB pulling the newly replicated DNA origin from one
pole to the opposite pole. This dramatic feat is one of
many intracellular mechanisms we explore in the next
chapter.
Some advanced forms of f luorescence microscopy
use laser beams to resolve subcellular details, and even
to visualize cells in 3D. One such method is confocal
laser scanning microscopy (or confocal microscopy).
In confocal microscopy, a microscopic laser light source
scans across the specimen. Figure 2.30 shows a biofilm
composed of the pathogenic bacterium Pseudomonas

Chemical Imaging Microscopy







Fluorescence microscopy uses fluorescence by a fluorophore to reveal specific cells or cell parts.
The specimen absorbs light at one wavelength and
then emits light at a longer wavelength. Color filters allow only light in the excitation range to reach
the specimen, and only emitted light to reach the
photodetector.
A fluorophore can label a cell part by chemical affinity for a component such as a membrane, attachment to
an antibody stain, or attachment to a short nucleic acid
that hybridizes to a DNA sequence.
Fluorescent proteins such as GFP can be fused
to a specific protein expressed by the cell. Endogenous GFP-type proteins can track intracellular movement of cell parts and can report environmental stress
responses.
Super-resolution imaging can define the position
of a f luorescent protein with a precision of 20–40
nm, tenfold better than the resolution limit of light
magnification.

Dark-Field and PhaseContrast Microscopy

Advanced optical techniques enable us to visualize structures that are difficult or impossible to detect under a
bright-field microscope, either because their size is below

61

Dark-field microscopy enables microbes to be visualized
as halos of bright light against the darkness, just as stars
are observed against the night sky. A tiny object whose size
is well below the wavelength of light, such as a virus particle, can be detected by light scattering. An important clinical application of dark-field microscopy is the detection of
Treponema pallidum, the cause of syphilis. T. pallidum cells
are so narrow (0.1 μm) that their shape cannot be resolved
by bright-field microscopy. Nevertheless, T. pallidum can
be detected by dark-field microscopy (Fig. 2.31). The spiral cells brightly scatter light, although the width of the
narrow cell is not resolved.
The optics of dark-field microscopy involve light scattering. The wavefront of scattered light is spherical, like a
wave emitted by a point source (see Fig. 2.9D). The scattered wave has a much smaller amplitude than that of the
incident (incoming) wave. Therefore, with ordinary brightfield optics, scattered light is washed out. Detection of scattered light requires a modified condenser arrangement that
excludes all light that is transmitted directly (Fig. 2.32).
The condenser contains a “spider light stop,” an opaque
disk held by three “spider legs” across an open ring. The

the limit of resolution of light or because their cytoplasm
is transparent. These techniques take advantage of special properties of light waves, such as light scattering (dark
field) and phase contrast.

Fluorescence microscopy can now be coupled to new
tools of chemical imaging microscopy. Chemical imaging uses mass spectrometry (analysis of molecular fragments by mass) to visualize the distribution of chemicals
in a biological sample, such as a microbial colony. The
chemical distribution can actually be observed within
a cell, at 100-nm resolution, using nanoscale secondary
ion mass spectrometry (NanoSIMS). Chemical imaging
offers extraordinary opportunities to map the structure
and function of cells (see Special Topic 2.1). In natural
communities, such as soil or the intestinal microbiome,
the distribution of chemicals can be mapped onto specific
microbes or subcellular compartments defined by fluorescence microscopy.

background appears dark.

ring permits only a hollow cone of light to focus on the
object. The incident light converges at the object and then
generates an inverted hollow cone radiating outward.
For dark field, the objective lens is positioned in the
central region, where it completely misses the directly
transmitted light. For this reason, the field appears dark.
However, light scattered by the object radiates outward in
a spherical wave. A sector of this spherical wave enters the
objective lens and is detected as a halo of light.
An intriguing application of dark-field optics is the
study of bacterial motility. Motility is important in

bacterial diseases such as urethritis, in which
the pathogen needs to swim up through the
urethra. The bacterial swimming apparatus
consists of helical filaments called flagella
(singular, flagellum), which are rotated by a
motor device embedded in the bacterial cell
wall (for flagellar structure, see Section 3.7).
The “swimming strokes” of bacteria were
first elucidated by Howard Berg and Robert
Macnab (1940–2003), using dark-field optics
to view the helical flagella. The flagella are too
narrow to resolve, but dark-field optics can
detect them, as seen in the dark-field micrograph of Salmonella enterica (Fig. 2.33).
Detecting flagella requires such high light
intensity the bacterial cell itself appears “overexposed”; its shape is unresolved. Another
disadvantage of dark-field microscopy is that
any tiny particle, including specks of dust
(see Fig. 2.31), can scatter light and interfere
with visualization of the specimen. Unless
the medium is extremely clear, it can be difficult to distinguish microbes of interest from
particulates.

Thought Questions

2.7 Some early observers claimed that the rotary motions
observed in bacterial flagella could not be distinguished from
whiplike patterns, comparable to the motion of eukaryotic
flagella. Can you imagine an experiment to distinguish the two
and prove that the flagella rotate? Hint: Bacterial flagella can
get “stuck” to the microscope slide or coverslip.

dark-field microscopy. What similar advantage do they
provide, and how do they differ?

Phase-Contrast Microscopy

Phase-contrast microscopy (PCM) exploits differences in
refractive index between the cytoplasm and the surrounding medium or between different organelles. The example of phase-contrast microscopy in Figure 2.34A shows
a community of microbes cultured from a cyanobacterial
liftoff mat in the ice of an Antarctic lake. This mat sample survived a month stored at –80°C and then was placed
under light in dilute salts at 10°C. Filamentous cyanobacteria (Microcoleus antarcticus) soon appeared, bubbling oxygen. The filaments hosted a protist, a stalked cell with cilia

lesser amplitude.

beating to engulf bacteria. Under phase contrast, the cell
outlines appear dark because light passes entirely through
the cell envelope, whose refractive index differs from that
of cytoplasm.
Phase-contrast optics depend on the principle of interference (introduced in Section 2.2). In interference, two
wavefronts (or two portions of a wavefront) interact with
each other by addition (amplitudes in phase) or subtraction
(amplitudes out of phase) (Fig. 2.34B). The result of interference between two waves is a pattern of alternating zones
of constructive and destructive interference (brightness and
darkness).
The optical system for phase contrast was invented in
the 1930s by the Dutch microscopist Frits Zernike (1888–
1966), for which he earned the Nobel Prize in Physics. In
this system, slight differences in the refractive index of the
various cell components are transformed into differences in
the intensity of transmitted light. Zernike’s scheme makes
use of the fact that living cells have relatively high contrast
because of their high concentration of solutes. Given the
size and refractive index of commonly observed cells, light
is retarded by approximately one-quarter of a wavelength
when it passes through the cell. In other words, after passing through a cell, light exits the cell about one-quarter of
a wavelength behind the phase of light transmitted directly
through the medium.
The Zernike optical system is designed to retard the
refracted light by an additional quarter of a wavelength,
so that the light refracted through the cell is slowed by a
total of half a wavelength compared with the light transmitted through the medium. When two waves are out of
phase by half a wavelength, they produce destructive interference, canceling each other’s amplitude (Fig. 2.34B,
right). The result is a region of darkness in the image of
the specimen.
As in dark-field microscopy, the light transmitted through
the medium in phase-contrast microscopy needs to be separated from the light interacting with the object—in this
case, light waves slowed by refraction. This separation is performed by a ring-shaped slit, called an “annular ring,” similar
in function to the spider light stop. The annular ring stops
light from passing directly through the center of the lens system, where the specimen is located, and generates a hollow
cone of light, which is focused through the specimen and
generates an inverted cone above it (Fig. 2.35). Light passing through the specimen, however, is not only retarded; it is
also refracted and thus bent into the central region within the
inverted cone.
Both the refracted light from the specimen and the
outer cone of transmitted light enter the phase plate. The
phase plate consists of refractive material that is thinner in
the region met by the outer (transmitted) light cone. The
refracted light passing through the center of the phase plate

Electron Microscopy,
Scanning Probe Microscopy,
and X-Ray Crystallography

All cells are built of macromolecular structures. The foremost tool for observing the shapes of these structures is
electron microscopy (EM). In electron microscopy, magnetic lenses focus beams of electrons to image cell membranes, chromosomes, and ribosomes with a resolution a
thousand times that of light microscopy. Other kinds of
microscopy are emerging, such as scanning probe microscopy, which images the contours of live bacteria. For atomlevel detail of a macromolecule, the tool of choice remains
X-ray crystallography.

Electron Microscopy

How does an electron microscope work? Electrons are
ejected from a metal subjected to a voltage potential. Like
photons, the electrons travel in a straight line, interact
with matter, and carry information about their interaction.
And also like photons, electrons can exhibit the properties of waves. The wavelength associated with an electron is
100,000 times smaller than that of a photon; for example,
an electron accelerated over a voltage of 100 kilovolts (kV)
has a wavelength of 0.0037 nm, compared with 400–750
nm for visible light. However, the actual resolution of electrons in microscopy is limited not by the wavelength, but
by the aberrations of the lensing systems used to focus electrons. The magnetic lenses used to focus electrons never
achieve the precision required to utilize the full potential
resolution of the electron beam.

Phase-contrast microscopy with Zernike optics superimposes refracted light and transmitted light shifted out
of phase so as to reveal differences in refractive index
as patterns of light and dark. Live cells with transparent cytoplasm, and the organelles of eukaryotes, can be
observed with high contrast.
Differential interference contrast microscopy (DIC)
with Nomarski optics superimposes interference bands on
an image, accentuating small differences in refractive index.

focusing the spiraling electrons much as a refractive lens focuses
light rays.

Electrons are focused by means of a magnetic field
directed along the line of travel of the beam (Fig. 2.37).
As a beam of electrons enters the field, it spirals around
the magnetic field lines. The shape of the magnet can be
designed to generate field lines that will focus the beam of
electrons in a manner analogous to the focusing of photons
by a refractive lens. The electron beam, however, forms a
spiral because electrons travel around magnetic field lines.
Magnetic lenses generate large aberrations; thus, we need a
series of corrective magnetic lenses to obtain a resolution of
about 0.2 nm. This resolution is a thousand times greater
than the 200-nm resolution of light microscopy.

Thought Question

2.9 Like a light microscope, an electron microscope can be
focused at successive powers of magnification. At each level,
the image rotates at an angle of several degrees. Given the
geometry of the electron beam, as shown in Figure 2.37, why
do you think the image rotates?

Transmission EM and scanning EM. Two major types of

electron microscopy are transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM).
In TEM, electrons are transmitted through the specimen
as in light microscopy to reveal internal structure. In SEM,
the electron beams scan across the surface of the specimen
and are reflected to reveal the contours of its 3D surface.

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM).

The transmission electron microscope closely parallels
the design of a bright-field microscope, including a source
of electrons (instead of light), a magnetic condenser lens,
a specimen, and an objective lens (Fig. 2.38). The light
source is replaced by an electron source consisting of a highvoltage current applied to a tungsten filament, which gives
off electrons when heated. The electron beam is focused
onto the specimen by a magnetic condenser lens. The specimen image is then magnified by a magnetic objective lens.
The projection lens, analogous to the ocular lens of a light
microscope, focuses the image on a fluorescent screen.
The scanning electron microscope is arranged somewhat differently from the TEM, in that a series of condenser lenses focuses the electron beam onto the surface of
the specimen. Reflected electrons are then picked up by a
detector (Fig. 2.39).
Sample preparation for EM. Standard electron microscopy

of biological specimens at room temperature poses special
problems. The entire optical column must be maintained
under vacuum to prevent the electrons from colliding with
the gas molecules in air. The requirement for a vacuum precludes the viewing of live specimens, which in any case would
be quickly destroyed by the electron beam. Moreover, the

structure of most specimens lacks sufficient electron density
(ability to scatter electrons) to provide contrast. Thus, the
specimen requires an electron-dense negative stain using
salts of heavy-metal atoms such as tungsten or uranium. The
heavy atoms collect outside the surfaces of cell structures
such as membranes, where their electron scatter reveals the
outline of the structure. Staining, however, can be avoided
for cryo-electron microscopy (see the next section).
We can prepare a specimen by embedding it in a polymer for thin sections. A special knife called a microtome
cuts slices through the specimen, each slice a fraction of

CHAPTER 2

a micrometer thick. Alternatively, a specimen consisting
of, for example, virus particles or isolated organelles can
be sprayed onto a copper grid. In either case, the electron
beam penetrates the object as if it were transparent. The
electrons are actually absorbed by the heavy-atom stain,
which collects at the edge of biological structures.
Figure 2.40 shows examples of transmission electron microscopy. The TEM of Bacillus anthracis in Figure 2.40A shows a thin section through a bacillus, including
a cell wall, membranes, and glycoprotein filaments. The
section is stained with uranyl acetate (a salt of uranium ion).

an electron-dense negative stain (phosphotungstate) deposited in the crevices around the complexes on a copper grid.
The micrograph reveals details of each motor, including
the axle and individual rings. The details are well resolved
by the beam of electrons—an achievement far beyond that
possible with a light microscope.
Scanning electron microscopy can show whole cells in
3D view, with much greater resolution than light microscopy can accomplish. SEM is particularly effective for visualizing cells within complex communities such as a biofilm.

archaea show up clearly in relation to one another via SEM.
In a clinical example, Figure 2.41B shows the pathogen
Helicobacter pylori colonizing the gastric epithelium (stomach
lining). H. pylori bacteria are helical rods (colorized green).
Note that the colorizing consists of interpretation by a photo
artist; no actual colors are observed by electron microscopy,
since colors are defined not by electrons but by visible light.
The bacterium Helicobacter pylori was first reported by Australian scientist Barry Marshall, but it proved difficult to isolate and culture. Ultimately, electron microscopy confirmed
the existence of H. pylori in the stomach and helped document its role in gastritis and stomach ulcers.

FIGURE 2.42  3D image construction in cryo-electron
tomography. Cryo-EM images are obtained in multiple focal

planes throughout an object. The images are combined through
a mathematical transformation to model the entire object in 3D.

An important limitation of traditional electron microscopy, whether TEM or SEM, is that the fixatives and heavyatom stains can introduce artifacts into the image, especially
at finer details of resolution. In some cases, different preparation procedures have led to substantially different interpretations of subcellular structure. For example, an oval that
appears hollow might be interpreted as a cell when in fact
it represents a deposit of staining material. A microscopic
structure that is interpreted incorrectly is termed an artifact.
Avoiding artifacts is an important concern in microscopy.

Cryo-Electron Microscopy
and Tomography

How can electron microscopy achieve finer resolution and
avoid artifacts due to staining? High-strength electron
beams now permit low-temperature cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), also known as electron cryomicroscopy. In cryo-EM, the specimen does not require staining,
because the high-intensity electron beams can detect smaller
signals (contrast in the specimen) than earlier instruments
could. The specimen must, however, be flash-frozen—that
is, suspended in water and frozen rapidly in a refrigerant of
high heat capacity (ability to absorb heat). The rapid freezing avoids ice crystallization, leaving the water solvent in
a glass-like amorphous phase. The specimen retains water
content and thus closely resembles its living form, although
it is still ultimately destroyed by electron bombardment.
Another innovation made possible by cryo-EM is
tomography, the acquisition of projected images from
different angles of a transparent specimen (see the Current Research Highlight). Cryo-electron tomography, or

electron cryotomography, avoids the need to physically
slice the sample for thin-section TEM. The images from
tomography are combined digitally to visualize the entire
object in 3D. Repeated scans can be summed computationally to obtain an image at high resolution (Fig. 2.42). The
scans are taken either at different angles or within different
focal planes. Each different scan images slightly different
parts of the object. The scans are summed computationally
to generate a 3D model.
One use of cryo-electron tomography is to generate
high-resolution models of virus particles. For a highly symmetrical virus, images of multiple particles can be averaged together. The digitally combined images can achieve
high resolution, nearly comparable to that of X-ray crystallography. Wah Chiu at Baylor College of Medicine
(Fig. 2.43A) pioneered the use of cryo-EM to visualize
virus particles at high resolution. An example is rice dwarf
virus (Fig. 2.43B), one of the world’s most economically
destructive agricultural pathogens. Other viruses modeled recently include herpes virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Cryo-EM is especially useful for
particles that cannot be crystallized for X-ray diffraction
analysis, the most common means of molecular visualization (see pages 71–73).
Cryo-EM models of a virus are impressive, but can we
build a 3D model of an entire cell? Grant Jensen and colleagues at the California Institute of Technology use cryoelectron tomography to visualize an entire flash-frozen
bacterium. Such a model includes all the cell’s parts and
their cytoplasmic connections—and reveals new structures
never seen before.

in a chain, each surrounded by a vesicle of

Figure 2.44B models the magnetosomes, reconstructed using multiple cryoEM scans across the volume of the cell. The
magnetosomes are colorized red, each surrounded by a membrane vesicle (green). The
vesicles are organized within the cell by a

yellow. Figure 2.44C shows an expanded
image of the magnetosomes viewed from the

magnetosome vesicles consist of invaginations from the cell membrane. Thus, the 3D
model shows how the magnetite particles
are fixed in position by invaginated membranes and held in a line by axial filaments.

enables nanoscale observation of cell
surfaces. Unlike electron microscopy, some forms of SPM can be used
to observe live bacteria in water or

SPM techniques measure a physical interaction, such as the “atomic
force” between the sample and a
sharp tip. Atomic force microscopy
(AFM) measures the van der Waals
forces between the electron shells of
adjacent atoms of the cell surface and
the sharp tip. In AFM, an instrument probes the surface of a sample
with a sharp tip a couple of micrometers long and often less than 10 nm
in diameter (Fig. 2.45A). The tip is
located at the free end of a lever that

between the tip and the sample surface. Deflection of the
lever is measured by a laser beam reflected off a cantilever
attached to the tip as the sample scans across. The measured deflections allow a computer to map the topography
of cells in liquid medium with a resolution below 1 nm.
In Figure 2.45B, AFM was used to observe live bacteria collected on a filter, from seawater off the coast of California. Two round bacteria and a helical bacterium can be
seen (raised regions, green-white). The cells were observed
in water suspension, without stain. Thus, AFM can help
assess the ecological contributions of marine bacteria that
cannot be cultured.

To know a cell, we need to isolate the cell’s individual
molecules. The major tool used at present to visualize a
molecule is X-ray diffraction analysis, or X-ray crystallography. Much of our knowledge of microbial genetics
(Chapters 7–12) and metabolism (Chapters 13–16) comes
from crystal structures of key macromolecules.
Unlike microscopy, X-ray diffraction does not present a
direct view of a sample, but generates computational models. Dramatic as the models are, they can only represent
particular aspects of electron clouds and electron density

that are fundamentally “unseeable.” That is why we represent molecular structures in different ways that depend on
the context—by electron density maps, as models defined
by van der Waals radii, or as stick models. Proteins are frequently presented in a cartoon form that shows alpha helix
and beta sheet secondary structures.
For a molecule that can be crystallized, X-ray diffraction makes it possible to fix the position of each individual atom in the molecule. Atomic resolution is possible
because the wavelengths of X-rays are much shorter than
the wavelengths of visible light and are comparable to the
size of atoms. X-ray diffraction is based on the principle of
wave interference (see Fig. 2.34B). The interference pattern is generated when a crystal containing many copies
of an isolated molecule is bombarded by a beam of X-rays
(Fig. 2.46A). The wavefronts associated with the X-rays are
diffracted as they pass through the crystal, causing interference patterns. In the crystal, the diffraction pattern is generated by a symmetrical array of many sample molecules
(Fig. 2.46B). The more copies of the molecule in the array,
the narrower the interference pattern and the greater the
resolution of atoms within the molecule. Diffraction patterns obtained from the passage of X-rays through a crystal
(Fig. 2.46C) can be analyzed by computation to develop
a precise structural model for the molecule, detailing the
position of every atom in the structure.

was particularly supportive of women students and colleagues, including Rosalind Franklin (1920–1958), who
made important discoveries about DNA and RNA, and
Nobel laureate Dorothy Crowfoot Hodgkin (1910–1994).
Hodgkin (Fig. 2.47B) won the 1964 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry for solving the crystal structures of penicillin
and vitamin B12 (Fig. 2.47C). She later solved one of the
first protein structures—that of the hormone insulin.
Today, X-ray data undergo digital analysis to generate sophisticated molecular models, such as the one seen
in Figure 2.48 of anthrax lethal factor, a toxin produced
by Bacillus anthracis that kills the infected host cells. The
model for anthrax lethal factor was encoded in a Protein
Data Bank (PDB) text file that specifies coordinates for all
atoms of the structure. The Protein Data Bank is a worldwide database of solved X-ray structures, freely available on
the Internet. Visualization software is used to present the
structure as a “ribbon” of amino acid residues, color-coded
for secondary structure. In Figure 2.48, the red coils represent alpha helix structures, whereas the blue arrows represent beta sheets (for a review of protein structures, see
Appendix 1).

Note:

Molecular and cellular biology increasingly rely on visualization in 3D. Many of the molecules illustrated in this book are
based on structural models deposited in the Protein Data Bank, as
indicated by the PDB file code. You may view these structures in
3D by downloading the PDB file and viewing it with a free plug-in
such as Jmol.

A limitation of X-ray analysis is the unavoidable deterioration of the specimen under bombardment by X-rays.
The earliest X-ray diffraction models of molecular complexes such as the ribosome relied heavily on components from thermophilic bacteria and archaea that grow at
high temperatures. Because thermophiles have evolved to
grow under higher thermal stress, their macromolecular

well ahead of cell division, forming two to four nucleoids.

Z-ring formation, the regulator allows the bacterial cell to

Determining how cells coordinate division with cell growth, DNA replication,
and chromosome segregation is akin
to solving an extremely challenging
brainteaser. Each time we identify a
component of the signal transduction
pathway coordinating cell division with
cell growth or an elusive part of the cell division machinery,
I experience not only the thrill of discovery but also the thrill
of knowing we have opened the door to yet another mystery!
How do you think our view of bacterial cell division will be
transformed in the future?

The new microfluidic devices, and the high-throughput

us to follow single cells from birth to division across tens

us answer long-standing questions about the forces behind
bacterial cytokinesis and the mechanisms that coordinate
cell division with other cell cycle processes. I can’t wait!

PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

To grow and multiply, a microbial cell must gain nutrients faster than its competitors do. For example, when your
intestinal Gram-negative bacteria have plenty of food, they
delay cell division at the Z-ring (see the Current Research
Highlight) so that they can absorb nutrients and grow
larger. At the same time, each cell must exclude toxins such
as your intestinal bile salts. Such toxins are screened by
the cell’s outer membrane. Microbial cells have evolved an
amazing range of molecular parts, from rotary machines
that make ATP to enzyme factories that build antibiotics.
Chapter 3 explores the key parts of bacteria and archaea,
including specialized structures such as magnetosomes.
Most bacteria share these traits:




Compact genome. Prokaryotic genomes are compact,
with relatively little noncoding DNA. Small genomes
maximize the production of cells from limited resources.



Tightly coordinated functions. The cell’s parts work
together in a highly coordinated mechanism, which may
enable a high rate of reproduction.

Beyond the fundamentals, bacteria evolve amazing diversity, which we will explore in Chapter 18. We also discuss
diversity of archaea in Chapter 19, and of microbial eukaryotes such as fungi and protists in Chapter 20. Overall, the
three domains show these key traits:


Thick, complex outer envelope. The envelope protects the cell from environmental stress and mediates
exchange with the environment.

are explored in Chapter 20.

Now we embark on a tour of a typical Gram-negative
bacterial cell, a common resident of your gut, Escherichia

Escherichia coli. Its general features apply to many kinds
of bacteria, particularly the Gram-negative inhabits of your
colon such as Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes. Remember
that we cannot literally “see” the molecules within a cell,
but microscopy and subcellular analysis provide the basis
for our model.

Model of a Bacterial Cell

Within a cell, the cytoplasm consists of a gel-like network
composed of proteins and other macromolecules. The
cytoplasm is contained by a cell membrane, or plasma
membrane. For E. coli, a Gram-negative bacterium (discussed in Section 3.3), the cell membrane is called the
inner membrane, in order to distinguish it from the

A cell is more than a “soup” full of ribosomes and enzymes.
In fact, the cell’s parts fit together in a structure that is
ordered, though flexible. Our model of the bacterial cell
(Fig. 3.1) offers an interpretation of how the major components of one cell fit together. The model represents

THE MICROBIAL CELL

additional “outer membrane.” The inner membrane is
composed of phospholipids, transporter proteins, and
other molecules. This membrane prevents cytoplasmic
proteins from leaking out and maintains gradients of ions
and nutrients. Between the inner and outer membranes
lies the cell wall, a fortress-like structure composed of
sugar chains linked covalently by peptides (peptidoglycan). The cell wall forms a single molecule that surrounds
the cell. The wall material is flexible, but it limits expansion of the cytoplasm, keeping the cell membrane intact
when water flows in. Like a balloon, the resulting turgor
pressure makes the cell rigid.
In a Gram-negative bacterium, the cell wall lies within
the periplasm, a water-filled space containing nutrientbinding proteins and secretion machines. Outside the cell
wall lies the outer membrane of phospholipids and lipopolysaccharides (LPS), a class of lipids attached to long
polysaccharides (sugar chains). The LPS layer may be surrounded by a thick capsule. The capsule polysaccharides
form a slippery layer that inhibits phagocytosis by macrophages (presented in Chapter 26). The inner membrane,
cell wall, and outer membrane constitute the Gramnegative cell envelope.
The bacterial envelope includes cell-surface proteins that
enable the bacterium to interact with specific host organisms. For example, E. coli cell-surface proteins help the
bacterium colonize the human intestinal epithelium. The
nitrogen-fixing symbiont Sinorhizobium has cell-surface
proteins that help the bacteria to colonize legume plants
for nitrogen fixation. Another common external structure
is the flagellum (plural, flagella), a helical protein filament
whose rotary motor propels the cell in search of a more
favorable environment. Flagella appear on many Proteobacteria, such as E. coli, but are absent in the Bacteroidetes
such as Bacteroides and Prevotella species.
Within the cell, the cell membrane and envelope provide an attachment point for one or more chromosomes.
The chromosome is organized within the cytoplasm as a
system of looped coils called the nucleoid (visualized by
DAPI fluorescence in the Current Research Highlight).
Unlike the round, compact nucleus of eukaryotic cells, the
bacterial nucleoid is not enclosed by a membrane. In fact,
loops of DNA extend throughout the cytoplasm. The DNA
is transcribed by RNA polymerase to form messenger RNA
(mRNA), as well as transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal
RNA (rRNA). As the mRNA transcripts grow, they bind
ribosomes to start synthesizing polypeptide chains. As the
polypeptides grow, protein complexes called chaperones
help them fold into their functional conformations. The
concept of information flow from DNA to RNA to protein
is presented in Chapters 7–10.
How can we know how all the cell parts shown in
Figure 3.1 interact and work together? Fluorescence

microscopy can show us how the nucleoid DNA expands
as the cell grows. As we learned in Chapter 2, fluorescence
can pinpoint a molecule or complex within a cell, such as
the Z-ring where the cell divides (see the Current Research
Highlight). But to visualize the cell’s interior as a whole
requires higher resolution, as in electron microscopy.

Biochemical Composition of Bacteria

The bacterial cell model in Figure 3.1 represents the
shape and size of cell parts but tells us little about the
chemistry of the cell, or of the cell’s environment. Chemistry explains, for example, why wiping a surface with ethanol kills microbes, whereas water has little effect. Water
is a universal constituent of cytoplasm but is excluded by
cell membranes. Ethanol, however, dissolves both polar
and nonpolar substances; thus, ethanol disintegrates
membranes and destroys the folded structure of proteins.
For a review of elementary chemistry, see eAppendix 1.
All cells share common chemical components:


Water, the fundamental solvent of life



Essential ions, such as potassium, magnesium, and
chloride ions



Small organic molecules, such as lipids and sugars, that
are incorporated into cell structures and that provide
nutrition by catabolism



Macromolecules, such as nucleic acids and proteins,
that contain information, catalyze reactions, and mediate transport, among many other functions

The details of bacterial chemistry emerged in the 1950s
through pioneering studies by Fred Neidhardt at the University of Michigan, and many colleagues. Cell composition varies with species, growth phase, and environmental
conditions (as we will see in later chapters). Table 3.1 summarizes the chemical components of a cell for the model
bacterium Escherichia coli during exponential growth.
Small molecules and ions. The E. coli cell consists of about
70% water, the essential solvent required to carry out fundamental metabolic reactions and to stabilize proteins.
The water solution contains inorganic ions, predominantly potassium, magnesium, and phosphate. Inorganic
ions store energy in the form of transmembrane gradients, and they serve essential roles in enzymes. For example, a magnesium ion is required at the active site of RNA
polymerase to help catalyze the linking of ribonucleotides
into RNA.
The cell also contains many kinds of small charged
organic molecules, such as phospholipids and enzyme
cofactors. A major class of organic cations is the polyamines, molecules with multiple amine groups that are

kinds that are rapidly degraded.

In rapidly growing cells, cell fission typically lags approximately one generation behind DNA replication—hence, two identical DNA copies per cell.

positively charged when the pH is near neutral. Polyamines
balance the negative charges of the cell’s DNA and stabilize
ribosomes during translation.
Macromolecules. Many cells have similar content of water

and small molecules, but their specific character is defi ned
by their macromolecules, especially their nucleic acids
(DNA and RNA) and their proteins. DNA and RNA
molecules can be isolated by size using agarose gel electrophoresis, in which the negatively charged molecules
migrate in an electrical field (see eAppendix 3). The nucleic
acid content of bacteria is relatively high, nearly 8% for
E. coli—much higher than in multicellular eukaryotes. For
microbes, the high nucleic acid content allows the cell to
maximize reproduction of its chromosome while minimizing cell resources.
The high proportion of nucleic acids actually makes
bacterial cells inedible for humans, who lack the enzymes
to digest the uric acid waste product of digested nucleotides. That is why we cannot eat most kinds of bacteria as a
major part of our diet. Nevertheless, we do consume bacteria within vegetables, as all plants have bacteria growing
within their transport tissues.
The cell’s genomic DNA directs expression of its proteins
(discussed in Chapters 7–10). A given cell uses different

genes to make different proteins, depending on environmental conditions such as temperature, nutrient levels, and
entry into a host organism. Individual proteins are made
in very different amounts, from 10 per cell to 10,000 per
cell. The proteins expressed by a cell under given conditions are known collectively as a proteome. (We discuss the
proteome in Chapter 8, as a function of the DNA genome
and RNA transcriptome.) Other kinds of macromolecules
are found in the cell wall and outer membrane. The bacterial cell wall consists of peptidoglycan, an organic polymer
of peptide-linked sugars that constitutes nearly 1% of the
cell mass, approximately the same mass as that of DNA.
Peptidoglycan limits the volume of the enclosed cell, so as
water rushes in, it generates turgor pressure. This investment of biomass in the cell wall shows the importance (for
most species) of maintaining turgor pressure in dilute environments, where water would otherwise enter by osmosis,
causing osmotic shock (see Appendix 1 and Section 3.2).

Thought Question

3.1 Which chemicals do we find in the greatest number in a

bacterial cell? The smallest number? Why does a cell contain
100 times as many lipid molecules as strands of RNA?

PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

Cell Fractionation

Cell fractionation (Fig. 3.2) is how we separate cellular
components such as membranes, ribosomes, and flagella.
We can study these isolated parts in detail, though we lose
information about interactions with other parts of the cell.

the proteins of the periplasm, cytoplasm, and inner and outer membranes. Photo Source: Lars D. Rennera and Douglas B. Weibel. PNAS 108(15):6264.

Cell fractionation also provides purified proteins that act
as antigens for candidate vaccines. For example, a vaccine
against Neisseria meningitidis type B (meningococcus)
contains a highly immunogenic outer membrane protein.
How can we disassemble a cell to isolate its parts?
Early-twentieth-century microbiologists wondered how
to separate cell parts, without all the molecules mixing
together. The answer was ultracentrifugation, the separation of molecules subject to high g forces (explained
in eAppendix 3). Mary Jane Osborn at the University of
Connecticut Health Center discovered that the inner and
outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria have different
densities, and thus can be separated by density gradient
ultracentrifugation.
Cell fractionation requires techniques that lyse (break
open) the cell. The lysis method must generate enough
force to separate the membrane lipids (held together by
hydrophobic force) but not enough to disintegrate complexes of protein and RNA. For a Gram-negative cell, the
method requires further specificity to separate “compartments” containing different sets of proteins: the inner
and outer membranes, and the aqueous cytoplasm and
periplasm.
Cell wall lysis and spheroplast formation. First, we suspend the cells in a sucrose solution containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), a molecule whose charged
groups disrupt the outer membrane (Fig. 3.2, step 1).
The disrupted membrane allows sucrose to cross. Sucrose
fi lls the periplasm, maintaining an osmotically stable solution. Next, lysozyme cleaves peptidoglycan and thus breaks
down the cell wall (step 2). Lacking the turgid cell wall, the
cell swells into a sphere called a spheroplast.
The periplasm of the spheroplasts then undergoes
osmotic shock, by transfer to distilled water (step 3). Water
rushes in through the EDTA-weakened outer membrane,
and the periplasm leaks out into the extracellular medium.
Note that other means of cell disruption may work better for other kinds of cells. Mild-detergent lysis can dissolve
membranes without denaturing proteins. Alternatively,
sonication is a way to lyse a cell by intense ultrasonic vibrations that are above the range of human hearing. For especially tough cells, such as cyanobacteria, a “bead beater”
with microscopic glass beads can tear the cells open.
Ultracentrifugation. A key tool of cell fractionation is the

ultracentrifuge, a device in which tubes containing solutions of cell components are spun at very high speed.
The high rotation rate generates centrifugal forces strong
enough to separate subcellular particles (see eAppendix 3).
The particles are collected in fractions of sample from
the tube, and then the fractions are observed by electron
microscopy.

Following osmotic shock, ultracentrifugation of the
spheroplasts (Fig. 3.2, step 4) separates the periplasmic contents from the other three types of cell compartments (cytoplasm, inner membrane, and outer membrane
fragments, which form vesicles). The periplasm is a valuable source of interesting proteins such as sugar transporters and chaperones (proteins that help other proteins fold
under stress).
Spheroplast lysis. The pellet can now be further pro-

cessed by a French press (Fig. 3.2, step 5), a device that
squeezes cell contents through a narrow tube to break open
the membranes. The broken membranes coalesce into tiny
vesicles. A second step of ultracentrifugation now pellets
the inner and outer membrane vesicles, while removing the
cytoplasm in the supernatant (step 6). The cytoplasm provides many types of proteins for study, such as FtsZ, as well
as complexes (multiprotein structures) such as the ribosomes and DNA polymerases.
Finally, the membrane fraction contains a mixture of
very different components of the inner membrane (such
as electron transport proteins) and the outer membrane
(such as cell-surface proteins that we could use to make
vaccines). We can separate the inner and outer membranes by density gradient ultracentrifugation (step 7).
The gradient of solution density is generated by forming a gradient of sucrose concentration. In the gradient,
the inner and outer membrane vesicles separate because
of differences in their density, not their particle size. The
lower-density fractions contain inner membrane vesicles,

whereas the higher-density fractions contain outer membrane vesicles.
The membrane vesicle proteins are analyzed on electrophoretic gels (Fig. 3.3). We can identify the protein bands
on the gel by enzyme digest and mass spectroscopy. The
enzyme trypsin cleaves proteins only at aminoacyl residues lysine or arginine, thus generating peptides of defined
composition. The peptide mass sizes are used to identify
the cleaved protein, based on comparison with the protein
sequence predicted by the organism’s genome.
Thought Question

3.2 Suppose we wish to isolate flagellar motors, which are

protein complexes that span the envelope from inner membrane to outer membrane (Fig. 3.1). How might we modify the
cell fractionation procedure?

Genetic Analysis

A limitation of cell fractionation is that it provides little
information about processes that require an intact cell,
such as cell division. How can we remove or alter a part of a
cell without breaking it open?
An approach that is complementary to cell fractionation is genetic analysis (discussed in detail in Chapters 7–12). In genetic analysis, we can mutate a strain so
as to lose or alter a gene; then we select mutant strains
for loss of a given function. The phenotype of the mutant
cell may yield clues about the function of the altered part.

nondividing cells that contain spiral FtsZ complexes. FtsZ was visualized by immunofluorescence. B. Model of FtsZ protein monomer based on
X-ray crystallography shows the position of the mutant residues, D212A and D45A.

For example, Figure 3.4A shows what happens to E. coli
cells containing mutations in the gene encoding FtsZ. In
certain strains, the ftsZ gene has one base pair altered by
site-directed mutagenesis (see Chapter 12) so as to replace
aspartate (D) at position 212 with alanine (A), designated D212A. The effect is to remove a negative charge at
a defined position on FtsZ (Fig. 3.4B). As a result, cells
extend into long filaments while failing to divide, and the
FtsZ protein forms abnormal spiral complexes. A different mutant has aspartate replaced by alanine at position
45. The position-45 mutant cells elongate while forming
abnormal blebs of cytoplasm off the side of the cell where
fission fails. These experiments reveal functional parts of
the FtsZ structure and clues to the formation of the Z-ring.
Different kinds of experimental methods may complement each other, to confirm or extend the conclusions from
each. Another example is the analysis of the ribosome by
cell fractionation, crystallography, and genetic analysis.
Ribosome analysis is presented in eTopic 3.1.

To Summarize




Bacterial cells are protected by a thick cell envelope. The
envelope includes a cell membrane and a peptidoglycan cell
wall. A Gram-negative cell includes an outer membrane,
and the cell membrane is called the inner membrane.
Bacteria are composed of nucleic acids, proteins,
phospholipids, and other organic and inorganic
chemicals. Proteins in the cell vary, depending on the
species and environmental conditions.









The bacterial cytoplasm is highly structured. DNA
replication, RNA transcription, and protein synthesis
occur coordinately within the cytoplasm.
Microscopy reveals cell structure. Transmission electron microscopy shows how cell parts fit within the cell
as a whole. Fluorescence microscopy reveals the location
and dynamics of individual components.
Cell fractionation isolates cell parts for structural and
biochemical analysis. The compartments of a Gram-negative cell can be separated by cell lysis and ultracentrifugation.
Genetic analysis of mutants reveals functions of cell
parts. Genetic analysis complements cell fractionation.

3.2

The Cell Membrane
and Transport

How does a cell distinguish “itself” from what is outside? The structure that defines the existence of a cell is
the cell membrane (Fig. 3.5). Overall, the membrane contains the cytoplasm within the external medium, mediating
exchange between the two. The cell membrane consists of
a phospholipid bilayer containing lipid-soluble proteins. It
behaves as a two-dimensional fluid, within which proteins
and lipids can diffuse. The proteins form about half the
mass of the membrane and provide specific functions, such
as nutrient transport. For review of elementary cell structure, see eAppendix 2.

Membrane Lipids



85

Membrane Proteins

Most membrane lipids are phospholipids. A phospholipid
possesses a charged phosphoryl “head” that contacts the
water interface, as well as a hydrophobic “tail” of fatty acids
packed within the bilayer. Lipid biosynthesis is a key process that is vulnerable to antibiotics. For example, the bacterial enzyme enoyl reductase, which synthesizes fatty acids
(discussed in Chapter 15) is the target of triclosan, a common antibacterial additive in detergents and cosmetics.
A.

CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

A typical phospholipid consists of glycerol with ester
links to two fatty acids and a phosphoryl polar head group,
which at neutral pH is deprotonated (negatively charged)
(Fig. 3.6). This kind of phospholipid is called a phosphatidate. The negatively charged head group of the phosphatidate can contain various organic groups, such as glycerol to
form phosphatidylglycerol (Fig. 3.6A). In other lipids, the
polar head group has a side chain with positive charge. The
positive charge commonly resides on an amine group, such
as ethanolamine in phosphatidylethanolamine (Fig. 3.6B).
Phospholipids with positive charge or with mixed charges
are concentrated in portions of the membrane that interact
with DNA, which has negative charge.
In the bilayer, all phospholipids face each other tail to
tail, keeping their hydrophobic side chains away from the
water inside and outside the cell. The two layers of phospholipids in the bilayer are called leaflets. One leaflet of phospholipids faces the cell interior; the other faces the exterior.
As a whole, the phospholipid bilayer imparts fluidity and
gives the membrane a consistent thickness (about 8 nm).

Extracellular environment

Hopanoid



Membrane proteins serve functions such as transport, communication with the environment, and structural support.


Structural support. Some membrane proteins anchor
together different layers of the cell envelope (discussed
in Section 3.3). Other proteins attach the membrane to
the cytoskeleton, or form the base of structures extending out from the cell, such as flagella.

PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

Detection of environmental signals. In Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera, the membrane
protein ToxR detects acidity and elevated temperature—
signs that the bacteria is in the host’s digestive tract. The
ToxR domain facing the cytoplasm then binds to a DNA
sequence, activating expression of cholera toxin.
Secretion of virulence factors and communication
signals. Membrane protein complexes export toxins and
cell signals across the envelope. For example, symbiotic
nitrogen-fixing rhizobia require membrane proteins
NodI and NodJ to transport nodulation signals out to
the host plant roots, inducing the plant to form root
nodules containing the bacteria.
Ion transport and energy storage. Transport proteins
manage ion flux between the cell and the exterior. Ion
transport generates gradients that store energy.

An example of a bacterial membrane protein is the leucine transporter LeuT (Fig. 3.7). LeuT drives uptake of
leucine, coupled to a gradient of sodium ions. The protein complex was purified for X-ray diffraction from Aquifex aeolicus, a thermophile whose heat-stable proteins form
durable crystals. Remarkably, LeuT is homologous (shares
common ancestry) with a human neuron protein that transports neurotransmitters. Thus, this bacterial protein serves
as a model for study of neuron function.
Proteins embedded in a membrane require a hydrophobic portion that is soluble within the membrane. Typically,
several hydrophobic alpha helices thread back and forth
through the membrane. Other peptide regions extend

outside the membrane, containing charged and polar
amino acids that interact favorably with water. Figure 3.7
shows the LeuT charge distribution. Hydrophobic amino
acid residues (white) make the protein soluble in the membrane, while portions with negative charge (red) and positive charge (blue) lock the protein in.

Transport across the Cell Membrane

The cell membrane acts as a barrier to keep water-soluble
proteins and other cell components within the cytoplasm.
But how do nutrients from outside get into the cell—and
how do secreted products such as toxins get out? Specific
membrane proteins transport molecules across the membrane between the cytoplasm and the outside. Selective
transport is essential for cell survival; it means the ability
to acquire scarce nutrients, exclude waste, and transmit signals to neighbor cells.
Passive diffusion. Small uncharged molecules, such as
O2 , CO2 , and water, easily permeate the membrane.
Some molecules, such as ethanol, also disrupt the
membrane—an action that can make such molecules
toxic to cells. By contrast, large, strongly polar molecules
such as sugars, and charged molecules such as amino
acids, generally cannot penetrate the hydrophobic interior of the membrane, and thus require transport by specific proteins. Water molecules permeate the membrane,
but their rate of passage is increased by protein channels
called aquaporins.

CHAPTER 3
Osmosis. Most cells maintain a concentration of total sol-

utes (molecules in solution) that is higher inside the cell
than outside. As a result, the internal concentration of
water is lower than the concentration outside the cell.
Because water can cross the membrane but charged solutes cannot, water tends to diffuse across the membrane
into the cell, causing the expansion of cell volume, in a
process called osmosis. The resulting pressure on the cell
membrane is called osmotic pressure (see figure in Appendix 1). Osmotic pressure will cause a cell to burst, or lyse,
in the absence of a countering pressure such as that provided by the cell wall. That is how bacteria are killed by
penicillin, which disrupts cell wall synthesis.
Membrane-permeant weak acids and bases. A special case of movement across cell membranes is that
of membrane-permeant weak acids and weak bases
(Fig. 3.8), which exist in equilibrium between charged
and uncharged forms:

Weak acid: HA H+ + A–
Weak base: B + H 2O BH+ + OH–
Membrane-permeant weak acids and weak bases cross the
membrane in their uncharged form: HA (weak acid) or B
(weak base). On the other side, entering the aqueous cytoplasm, the acid dissociates (HA to A– and H+) or the base
reassociates with H+ (B to BH+). In effect, membranepermeant acids conduct acid (H+) across the membrane,



CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION



87

causing acid stress; similarly, membrane-permeant bases
conduct OH– across the membrane, causing alkali stress.
If the H+ concentration (acidity) outside the cell is greater
than inside, it will drive weak acids into the cell.
Many key substances in cellular metabolism are
membrane-permeant weak acids and bases, such as acetic acid. Most pharmaceutical drugs—therapeutic agents
delivered to our tissues via the bloodstream—are weak
acids or bases whose uncharged forms exist at sufficiently low concentration to cross the membrane without
disrupting it. Examples of weak acids that deprotonate
(acquiring negative charge) at neutral pH include aspirin
(acetylsalicylic acid) and penicillin (Fig. 3.8A). Examples
of weak bases that protonate (acquiring positive charge)
at neutral pH include Prozac (fluoxetine) and tetracycline
(Fig. 3.8B).
Thought Question

3.3 Amino acids have acidic and basic groups that can dissociate. Why are they not membrane-permeant weak acids
or weak bases? Why do they fail to cross the phospholipid
bilayer?

Transmembrane ion gradients. Molecules that carry a

fi xed charge, such as hydrogen and sodium ions (H+ and

usually exist in very different concentrations inside and
outside the cell. An ion gradient (ratio of ion concentrations) across the cell membrane can store energy for nutrition or to drive the transport of other molecules. Inorganic
ions require transport through specific transport proteins, or transporters. So, too, do organic molecules that
carry a charge at cytoplasmic pH, such as amino acids and
vitamins. Transport may be passive or active. In passive
transport, molecules accumulate or dissipate along their
concentration gradient. Active transport—that is, transport from lower to higher concentration—requires cells
to spend energy. A transporter protein obtains energy
for active transport by cotransport of another substance
down its gradient from higher to lower concentration, or
by coupling transport to a chemical reaction (discussed in
Chapter 4).

Membrane Lipid Diversity

Membranes require a uniform thickness and stability to
maintain structural integrity and function. So why do individual membrane lipids differ in structure? Different environments favor different forms of membrane lipids. For
example, lipid structure helps determine whether an organism can grow in a hot spring, or whether it can colonize
human lungs.
Environmental stress. Starvation stress increases bacte-

rial production of lipids with an unusual type of phosphoryl head group. Cardiolipin, or diphosphatidylglycerol,

is actually a double phospholipid linked by a glycerol
(Fig. 3.9A). Cardiolipin concentration increases in bacteria grown to starvation or stationary phase (discussed
in Chapter 4). Within a cell, cardiolipin does not diffuse
at random; it concentrates in patches called “domains”
near the cell poles. The polar localization of cardiolipin
was demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy, in which a
cardiolipin-specific fluorophore localized to the poles of
E. coli (Fig. 3.9B). The “wedge” shape of cardiolipin, with
its narrow head group and wide fatty acid group, is thought
to form concave domains of lipid that stabilize the curve
of the polar membrane. Cardiolipin may enhance the formation of smaller cells during starvation. How does this
benefit the cell? At the cell pole (Fig. 3.9C), cardiolipin
binds certain environmental stress proteins, such as a protein that transports osmoprotectants when the cell is under
osmotic stress. Thus, a phospholipid can have specific functions associated with specific membrane proteins.
The fatty acid component of phospholipids also varies.
The most common bacterial fatty acids are hydrogenated
chains of varying length, typically between 6 and 22 carbons. But some fatty acid chains are partly unsaturated
(possess one or more carbon-carbon double bonds). Most
unsaturated bonds in membranes are cis, meaning that both
alkyl chains are on the same side of the bond, so the unsaturated chain has a “kink,” as in the cis form of oleic acid
(Fig. 3.10). Because the kinked chains do not pack as closely
as the straight hydrocarbon chains do, the membrane is
more “fluid.” This is why, at room temperature, unsaturated
vegetable oils are fluid, whereas highly saturated butterfat

Interestingly, both hopanoids and cholesterol are synthesized from the same precursor molecules as the unique lipids of archaea (Fig. 3.13). It may be that hopanoids and

of lipids that were once possessed by a common ancestor of

The cell membrane consists of a phospholipid bilayer
containing hydrophobic membrane proteins. Membrane
proteins serve diverse functions, including transport,
cell defense, and cell communication.
Small uncharged molecules, such as oxygen, can penetrate the cell membrane by diffusion.
Membrane-permeant weak acids and weak bases exist
partly in an uncharged form that can diffuse across the
membrane and increase or decrease, respectively, the H+
concentration within the cell.
Polar molecules and charged molecules require
membrane proteins to mediate transport. Such
facilitated transport can be active or
passive.
Ion gradients generated by membrane pumps store energy for
cell functions. Active transport HO
(up the concentration gradient)
requires input of energy, whereas
passive transport (down a gradient) does not.
Diverse fatty acids are found in different microbial species and in microbes

The Cell Wall and
Outer Layers

How do bacteria and archaea protect their cell membrane? For most species, the cell envelope includes at least
one structural supporting layer, like an external skeleton,
located outside the cell membrane. The most common

Hopane

structural support is the cell wall (see Fig. 3.1). Many species possess additional coverings, such as an outer membrane or an S-layer. Nevertheless, a few prokaryotes, such
as the mycoplasmas, have a cell membrane with no outer
layers, depending on host fluids for osmotic balance. Some
archaea with only a cell membrane grow in extreme acid
(pH zero); how they survive is unknown.

The Cell Wall Is a Single Molecule

The bacterial cell wall, also known as the sacculus, consists of a single interlinked molecule that envelops the cell.
The sacculus has been isolated from E. coli and visualized
by TEM; in Figure 3.14A, the isolated sacculus appears
flattened on the sample grid like a deflated balloon. Its

geometrical structure encloses maximal volume with minimal surface area. The sacculus—unlike the membrane—is
a single-molecule cage-like structure, highly porous to ions
and organic molecules. The mesh grows by strand insertion
and elongation in arcs around the cell. The cage-like form
is not rigid; it is more like a flexible mesh bag with unbreakable joints. Turgor pressure within the enclosed cytoplasm
fills out the cell’s shape, such as a rod or a spherical coccus.
Peptidoglycan structure. Most bacterial cell walls are

composed of peptidoglycan, a polymer of peptide-linked

chains of amino sugars. Peptidoglycan is synonymous with
murein (“wall molecule”). The molecule consists of parallel polymers of disaccharides called glycan chains crosslinked with peptides of four amino acids (Fig. 3.14B).
Peptidoglycan is unique to bacteria, although some archaea
build analogous structures whose overall physical nature is
similar. (Archaeal cell walls are presented in Chapter 19.)
The long chains of peptidoglycan consist of repeating
units of a disaccharide composed of N-acetylglucosamine
(an amino sugar derivative) and N-acetylmuramic acid
(glucosamine plus a lactic acid group) (Fig. 3.14B). The

92



PART 1

lactate group of muramic acid forms an amide link with the
amino terminus of a short peptide containing four to six
amino acid residues. The peptide extension can form crossbridges connecting parallel strands of glycan.
The peptide contains two amino acids in the unusual
D mirror form: D-glutamic acid and D-alanine. The third
amino acid, m-diaminopimelic acid, has an extra amine
group, which forms an amide link to a cross-bridged peptide. The amide link forms with the fourth amino acid of
the adjacent peptide, D-alanine (1) (Fig. 3.14B). The crossbridge forms by removal of a second D-alanine (2) at the
end of the chain. The cross-linked peptides of neighboring
glycan strands form the cage of the sacculus.

Note:

Amino acids have two forms that are mirror opposites,
D and L, of which only the L form is incorporated by ribosomes into
protein. The D-form amino acids, however, are used by microbes
for many nonprotein structural molecules.

The details of peptidoglycan structure vary among bacterial species. Some Gram-positive species, such as Staphylococcus aureus (a cause of toxic shock syndrome), have
peptides linked by bridges of pentaglycine instead of the
D -alanine link to m-diaminopimelic acid. In Gram-negative
species, the m-diaminopimelic acid is linked to the outer
membrane, as discussed shortly.
Peptidoglycan synthesis as a target for antibiotics. Syn-

thesis of peptidoglycan requires many genes encoding
enzymes to make the special sugars, build the peptides,

A.

and seal the cross-bridges. Many of these enzymes bind
the antibiotic penicillin and are thus known as penicillinbinding proteins. Because peptidoglycan is unique to bacteria, enzymes of peptidoglycan biosynthesis make excellent
targets for new antibiotics (see Fig. 3.14B). For example,
the transpeptidase that cross-links the peptides is the target of penicillin. Vancomycin, a major defense against Clostridium difficile and drug-resistant staphylococci, prevents
cross-bridge formation by binding the terminal D-AlaD-Ala dipeptide. Vancomycin binding prevents release of
the terminal D-alanine.
Unfortunately, the widespread use of such antibiotics
selects for evolution of resistant strains. One of the most
common agents of resistance is the enzyme beta-lactamase,
which cleaves the lactam ring of penicillin, rendering it ineffective as an inhibitor of transpeptidase. In a different mechanism, strains resistant to vancomycin contain an altered
enzyme that adds lactic acid to the end of the branch peptides in place of the terminal D-alanine. The altered peptide
is no longer blocked by vancomycin. As new forms of drug
resistance emerge, researchers continue to seek new antibiotics that target cell wall formation (discussed in Chapter 27).
How does peptidoglycan grow, overall, throughout
the elongating cell? Interestingly, different kinds of bacteria have evolved to organize their cell wall growth differently. Yves Brun and his student Erkin Kuru, at Indiana
University, devised an ingenious way to reveal the growth
pattern (Fig. 3.15). Kuru designed D-amino acids with fluorophores attached that the growing cell wall incorporates.

Most bacteria have additional envelope layers that provide
structural support and protection from predators and host
defenses (Fig. 3.16). Additional molecules are attached to
the cell wall and cell membrane, and some thread through
the layers. Here we present the envelope composition of
three major kinds of bacteria, two of which (Firmicutes and
Proteobacteria) are distinguished by the Gram stain. The
third, Mycobacteria, is distinguished by the acid-fast stain
(discussed in Chapter 2).

CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION

Cell Envelope of Bacteria

Because these are D-amino acids and not L-amino acids, ribosome-directed translation does not use them. Thus, the fluorophores label only cell wall, not proteins. Kuru found that
bacteria such as E. coli and Bacillus subtilis synthesize cell wall
in zones dispersed throughout the cell. Gram-positive cocci,
however, such as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus, synthesize
cell wall only at the midpoint (or septum), where the cell is
about to fission (discussed in the next section). Still other
bacteria, such as the actinomycete Streptomyces, form new cell
wall only at the poles.

A. Firmicutes (Gram-positive)



Firmicutes (Gram-positive) have a thick cell wall with
3–20 layers of peptidoglycan, interpenetrated by teichoic
acids. The phylum Firmicutes consists of Gram-positive

A section of a Firmicute cell envelope (Gram-positive) is

negatively charged cross-threads of teichoic acids, as well
as the overall thickness of the Gram-positive cell wall, help
retain the Gram stain.
How does the cell wall attach extracellular structures?
Gram-positive bacteria have a type of enzyme called “sortase” that forms a peptide bond from a cell wall cross-bridge
to a protein extending from the cell. Proteins attached by
sortases can help the cell acquire nutrients, or help the cell
adhere to a substrate. Sortases are now used in the protein
engineering industry.

bacterium found on the surface of beets and carrots. The
S-layer is a crystalline sheet of thick subunits consisting
of protein or glycoprotein (proteins with attached sugars). Each subunit contains a pore large enough to admit
a wide range of molecules (Fig. 3.18). As modeled by
cryo-EM tomography (see Chapter 2), the S-layer proteins are arranged in a highly ordered array, either hexagonally or tetragonally. The S-layer is rigid, but it also
flexes and allows substances to pass through it in either
direction. S-layers help pathogens such as Bacillus anthracis bind and attack host cells. An S-layer contributes to
biofi lm formation (the periodontal bacterium Tannerella
forsythia) and swimming (the aquatic cyanobacterium
Synechococcus species).
The functions of the S-layer are hard to study in the laboratory because the S-layer is often lost by bacteria after
repeated subculturing. Traits commonly diminish in the
absence of selective pressure for genes encoding them—
a process called reductive evolution (discussed in Chapter 17). For example, the mycoplasmas are close relatives
of Gram-positive bacteria that have permanently lost their
cell walls, as well as the S-layer. Mycoplasmas have no
need for cell walls, because they are parasites living in host

environments, such as the human lung, where they are protected from osmotic shock.
Capsule. Another common extracellular structure is the

capsule, a slippery layer of loosely bound polysaccharides.
The capsule of pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus can
prevent phagocytosis by white blood cells, thereby enabling
the pathogen to persist in the blood.

Thought Question

3.6 Why would laboratory culture conditions select for evolution of cells lacking an S-layer?

Proteobacterial Cell Envelope—
Gram-Negative

A cell envelope of Proteobacteria (Gram-negative) is
shown in Figures 3.16B and 3.19. The envelope includes
one or two layers of peptidoglycan covered by an outer
membrane. The Gram-negative outer membrane confers defensive abilities and toxigenic properties on many
pathogens, such as Salmonella species and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (strains that cause hemorrhaging of the
colon). Between the outer and inner (cell) membranes,
the aqueous compartment (containing the cell wall) is
called the periplasm.
Lipoprotein and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The inwardfacing leaflet of the outer membrane has a phospholipid
composition similar to that of the cell membrane (which

96



PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

in Gram-negative species is called the inner membrane
or inner cell membrane). The outer membrane’s inwardfacing leaflet includes lipoproteins that connect the
outer membrane to the peptide bridges of the cell wall.
The major lipoprotein is called murein lipoprotein, also
known as Braun lipoprotein (Fig. 3.19A). Murein lipoprotein consists of a protein with an N-terminal cysteine
attached to three fatty acid side chains. The side chains
are inserted in the inward-facing leaflet of the outer membrane. The C-terminal lysine forms a peptide bond with
the m-diaminopimelic acid of peptidoglycan (murein).
What happens to a mutant cell that fails to make murein
lipoprotein? As the cell grows and divides, it fails to attach
its outer membrane to the growing cell wall, causing the
outer membrane to balloon out in the region where the
daughter cells separate (Fig. 3.19B).
The outward-facing leaflet of the outer membrane
has very different lipids from the inner leaflet. The main
outward-facing phospholipids are called lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Fig. 3.20). LPS is of crucial medical importance because it acts as an endotoxin. An endotoxin is a
cell component that is harmless as long as the pathogen

remains intact; but when released by a lysed cell, endotoxin
overstimulates host defenses, inducing potentially lethal
endotoxic shock. Thus, antibiotic treatment of an LPScontaining pathogen can kill the cells but can also lead to
death of the patient.
The membrane-embedded anchor of LPS is lipid A,
a molecule shaped like a six-legged giraffe (Fig. 3.20A).
The lipid A moiety is the endotoxic part of LPS. The molecule’s six fatty acid “legs” have shorter chains than those of
the inner cell membrane, and two pairs are branched. The
fatty acids have ester or amide links to the “body,” a dimer
of glucosamine (an amino sugar also found in peptidoglycan). Analogous to the glycerol of glyceride phospholipids,
each glucosamine has a phosphoryl group whose negative
charge interacts with water. One glucosamine extends the
long “neck” of the core polysaccharide, a sugar chain that
reaches far outside the cell (Fig. 3.20B). The core polysaccharide consists of five to ten sugars with side chains
such as phosphoethanolamine. It extends to an O antigen or O polysaccharide, a chain of as many as 200 sugars.
The O polysaccharide may be longer than the cell itself.
These chains of sugars form a layer that helps bacteria
resist phagocytosis by white blood cells. The combination
of sugar units in the O antigen varies greatly among different strains and species of Gramnegative bacteria.

Outer membrane proteins. The
outer membrane contains unique
proteins not found in the inner
membrane. Outer membranes contain a class of transporters called
porins that permit the entry of
nutrients such as sugars and peptides (Fig. 3.21). Outer membrane
porins such as OmpF have a distinctive cylinder of beta sheet conformation (reviewed in eAppendix 1),
also known as a beta barrel. A typical outer membrane porin exists as a
trimer of beta barrels, each of which
acts as a pore for nutrients.
Outer membrane porins have
limited specificity, allowing passive uptake of various molecules—
including antibiotics such as
ampicillin. Ampicillin is a form of
penicillin, which must get through
the outer membrane to access the
cell wall in order to block the formation of peptide cross-bridges. Ampicillin contains two charged groups
and is thus unlikely to diffuse

Bacterial Cytoskeleton

In eukaryotes, cell shape has long been known to be maintained by a cytoskeleton of protein microtubules and filaments (reviewed in eAppendix 2). But what determines
the shape of bacteria? We saw earlier that bacterial shape
is in part maintained by the cell wall and the resulting turgor pressure. But research over the past decade
shows that bacteria also possess protein cytoskeletal
components—and remarkably, some of them are homologous to eukaryotic cytoskeletal proteins. For example, the
cell division protein FtsZ is a homolog of the eukaryotic
protein tubulin (the subunit of eukaryotic microtubules).

Another bacterial cytoskeletal protein, MreB, is a homolog
of the eukaryotic microfilament protein actin.
The bacterial cytoskeletal proteins are revealed by gene
defects that drastically alter the cell shape. For example,
Figure 3.23A compares wild-type cells of Bacillus subtilis with cells containing mutations in three mreB homologs (mreB, mreI, and mreBH). The wild-type cells have
a defined rod shape, whereas the mutant shape is round
and undefined. The mutant lacks the MreB complex that
regulates peptidoglycan synthesis and thereby defines the
rod-shaped cell. Another example of a shape-altering mutation affects the comma-shaped cell of Caulobacter crescentus (Fig. 3.23B). A mutation in gene creS results in cells
that are straight instead of curved. The creS gene expresses
the cytoskeletal protein CreS (crescentin).
How do the various cytoskeletal proteins work together
to generate the overall shape of a bacterial cell? The functions of cytoskeletal proteins are probed by fluorescent protein fusions (Fig. 3.24). In both spherical bacteria (cocci)
and rod-shaped bacilli, the FtsZ complex Z-ring determines the cell diameter. Elongation of a rod-shaped cell
requires polymerization of a second cytoskeletal protein,
MreB (Fig. 3.24B). MreB localizes in arc-shaped patches,
just beneath the cell membrane of the rod-shaped cell. Some
models propose a helical coil of MreB around the entire
cell, but more recent data indicate arcs of MreB driven by

(called a vibrio, or crescent shape), the third cytoskeletal protein, crescentin, polymerizes along the inner curve of the
crescent (Fig. 3.24C). The cell’s outer curve is visualized

work together within cells to generate the shapes of bacteria.

To Summarize






The cell wall maintains turgor pressure. The cell wall
is porous, but its network of covalent bonds generates
turgor pressure that protects the cell from osmotic shock.
The Gram-positive cell envelope has multiple layers of
peptidoglycan, threaded by teichoic acids.
The S-layer of proteins is highly porous but can prevent
phagocytosis and protect cells in extreme environments.
In archaea, the S-layer serves the structural function of a
cell wall.

THE MICROBIAL CELL

The capsule, composed of polysaccharide and glycoprotein filaments, protects cells from phagocytosis. Either
Gram-positive or Gram-negative cells may possess a
capsule.
The Gram-negative outer membrane regulates nutrient uptake and excludes toxins. The outer membrane
contains LPS and protein porins of varying selectivity.
The mycobacterial cell wall includes features of both
Gram-positive and Gram-negative cells. The arabinogalactan layer adds thickness to the cell wall. The
mycolate outer membrane and phenolic glycolipids limit
uptake of nutrients and antibiotics.
The bacterial cytoskeleton includes proteins that regulate cell size, play a role in determining the rod shape of
bacilli, and generate curvature in vibrios.

a filamentous nucleoid region that extends through the
cytoplasm. In contrast, the nucleus of the eukaryotic cell,
only a fraction of which is visible in the figure, is many
times larger than the entire bacterial cell, and the chromosomes it contains are separated from the cytoplasm by the
nuclear membrane.

DNA Is Organized in the Nucleoid

All living cells on Earth possess chromosomes consisting
of DNA. The genetic functions of microbial DNA are discussed in detail in Chapters 7–12. Here we focus on the
physical organization of DNA within the nucleoid of bacterial and archaeal cells (Fig. 3.26A).

Cell Division

How are DNA and its expression machinery organized
within the cell? Bacteria organize their DNA very differently from eukaryotes. For example, Figure 3.25 shows
enteropathogenic E. coli cells growing upon a cultured
human cell. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) are diarrheal
pathogens that cause the host cell to form actin “pedestals” where the bacteria inject toxins (discussed in Chapter 25). In this thin-section TEM, each bacterium contains

CHAPTER 3

Note:

In bacteria and archaea, the genome typically consists of
a single circular chromosome, but some species have a linear chromosome or multiple chromosomes. In this chapter we focus on the
simple case of a single circular chromosome.

In a bacterial cell the DNA is organized in loops called
domains. The DNA domains extend throughout the cytoplasm. The midpoint on the DNA is the origin of replication,
which is attached to the cell envelope at a point on the cell’s
equator, halfway between the two poles (Fig. 3.26B). At
the origin, the DNA double helix is melted open by binding
proteins, and then DNA polymerase synthesizes new strands
in both directions (bidirectionally). The origin and other
aspects of DNA replication are covered in detail in Chapter 7.
How does all of the cell’s DNA fit neatly into the nucleoid? In some bacteria, the domains loop back to the center of
the cell, near the origin of replication. Within the domains,
the DNA is compacted by supercoils. Supercoils (or superhelical turns) are extra twists in the chromosome, beyond those
inherent in the structure of the DNA double helix (discussed
in Chapter 7). The supercoiling causes portions of DNA to
double back and twist upon itself, resulting in compaction of
the chromosome. Supercoils are generated by enzymes such
as gyrase, a major target for antibiotics such as quinolones.
DNA is also compacted by DNA-binding proteins (see
Fig. 3.26B). Some binding proteins, such as H-NS and
HU, also function as regulators of gene expression. Binding proteins can respond to the state of the cell; for example, under starvation conditions, when most RNA synthesis
ceases, the binding protein Dps is used to organize the
DNA into a protected crystalline structure. Such “biocrystallization” by Dps and related proteins may be a key to the
extraordinary ability of microbes to remain viable for long
periods in stationary phase or as endospores.
Rifampin blocks
RNA synthesis.

CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION



101

Note:

In biology, the word “domain” is used in several different
ways, each referring to a defined portion of a larger entity.

 DNA domains of the nucleoid are distinct loops of DNA that

extend from the origin.

 Protein domains are distinct functional or structural regions of

a protein.

 Lipid domains are clusters of one type of lipid within a membrane.
 Taxonomic domains are genetically distinct classes of organ-

isms, such as Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya.

Transcription and Translation

The information encoded in DNA is “read” by the processes
of transcription and translation to yield gene products. The
initial product of a gene is a single strand of ribonucleic
acid (RNA), produced when DNA is transcribed by RNA
polymerase (Fig. 3.27). In some cases, the newly made
RNA has a function of its own, such as being one of the
RNA components of a ribosome, the cell’s protein-making
machine. For most genes, however, the RNA is a messenger
RNA (mRNA) that immediately binds to a ribosome for
translation. A growing bacterial cell typically invests 40% of
its energy in the translation of mRNA by ribosomes. The
ribosome, with its large number of protein and RNA components, is probably the most complex subcellular machine
to be discovered. Because of its complexity, the ribosome is
targeted by many kinds of antibiotics, such as tetracyclines.
The process of translation is discussed further in Chapter 8.
Coupling of transcription and translation. In bacteria and
archaea, translation is tightly coupled to transcription;
the ribosomes bind to mRNA and begin translation even
before the mRNA strand is complete. Thus, a growing bacterial cell is full of mRNA strands dotted with ribosomes

and secreted proteins are synthesized in association with

proteins. Membrane protein maturation and secretion are
discussed in Chapter 8.

Cell Division

How does a growing bacterial cell divide, or fission, into
daughter cells? Bacterial cell fission requires highly coordinated growth and expansion of all the cell’s parts. Unlike
eukaryotes, prokaryotes synthesize RNA and proteins
continually while the cell’s DNA undergoes replication.

CHAPTER 3

Note:

Each replisome contains two DNA polymerases (for
leading and lagging strands). Each dividing nucleoid requires two
replisomes (for bidirectional replication), and thus four DNA polymerases overall.

Within the cell, replication proceeds outward in both
directions around the genome. Thus, bidirectional replication requires two replisomes, one for each replicating fork.
Fluorescent probes show that two replisomes are located near
the middle of the growing cell (Fig. 3.29). Each replisome
forms a replicating fork that directs two daughter strands of
DNA toward opposite poles. The two copies of the DNA
origin of replication (green in the figure), attached to the
cell envelope, move apart as the cell expands. The termination site (red) remains in the middle of the cell, where the
two replisomes continue replication at both forks. Finally, as
the termination site replicates, the two replisomes separate

103

Septation Completes Cell Division

For the cell to divide, DNA replication must be complete.
Replication of the DNA termination site triggers growth
of the dividing partition of the envelope, called the septum (plural, septa). The septum grows inward from the
sides of the cell, at last constricting and sealing off the two
daughter cells. This process is called septation. Septation
and envelope extension require rapid biosynthesis of all
envelope components, including membranes and cell wall.
Recall how the lack of murein lipoprotein connecting the
outer membrane to the cell wall causes deformation at septation (see Fig. 3.19B). The biosynthetic enzymes required
for cell division are all of great interest as antibiotic targets.
Cell wall biosynthesis poses an interesting theoretical problem: How is it possible to expand the covalent network of
the sacculus without breaking links to insert new material,
thus weakening the wall? The answer remains unclear.
Septation of spherical cells. In spherical cells (cocci), such
as Staphylococcus aureus, the process of septation generates
most of the new cell envelope to enclose the expanding
cytoplasm (Fig. 3.30). Furrows form in the cell envelope,

from the DNA. At each new origin site, however, two pairs
of new replisomes have formed. In a fast-growing cell, the
new origin sites begin a second round of replication, even
before termination of the previous round.
Note that the contents of the cytoplasm and envelope
must expand coordinately with DNA replication for the
cell to generate progeny equivalent to the parent. In a rodshaped cell, the cell envelope and cell wall must elongate
in a process coordinated by cytoskeletal proteins so as to
maintain progeny of even girth and length. As discussed
earlier, the girth and length of the elongating cell depend
on shape-determining proteins such as FtsZ and MreB.

AHMED TOUHAMI, ET AL. 2004. J. BACTERIOL. 186:3286

Bacterial DNA replication is coordinated with the expansion of the cell wall and ultimately the separation of the cell
into two daughter cells. Bacteria do not undergo mitosis
or meiosis (these eukaryotic processes are reviewed in eAppendix 2). Bacterial DNA replication is outlined here as it
relates to cell division; the molecular details of the process
are discussed in Chapter 7.
Replication begins at the origin of replication
(Fig. 3.29 ), a unique DNA sequence in the chromosome. At the origin sequence, the DNA double helix begins
to unzip, forming two replication forks. At each replication fork, DNA is synthesized by DNA polymerase. The
complex of DNA polymerase with its accessory components
is called a replisome. The replisome actually includes two
DNA polymerase enzymes: one to replicate the “leading
strand,” the other for the “lagging strand.” The lag time is
short compared with the overall time of replication; thus,
as the replisome travels along the DNA, it converts one
helix into two progeny helices almost simultaneously.

were called fts for “fi lamentation temperature
sensitive” because their mutation is temperature sensitive. The temperature-sensitive cells
divide normally at a “permissive” temperature
but fail to septate at the “restrictive” temperature, forming long fi laments. Temperaturesensitive mutants offer the researcher a way
to grow and study bacteria that have severe
defects in cell growth.

in a ring all around the cell equator, as new cell wall grows
inward. The wall material must consist of two separable
partitions. When the partitions are complete, the two progeny cells peel apart. The facing halves of each cell consist of
entirely new cell wall.
The spatial orientation of septation has a key role in
determining the shape and arrangement of cocci. If the
cell always septates in parallel planes, as in Streptococcus
species, cells form chains (Fig. 3.30). If, however, the
cell septates in random orientations, or if cells reassociate loosely after septation, they form compact hexagonal
arrays similar to the grape clusters portrayed in classical paintings—hence the Greek-derived term staphylococci (staphyle means “bunch of grapes”). Such clusters
are found in colonies of Staphylococcus aureus. If subsequent septation occurs at right angles to the previous division, the cells may form tetrads and even cubical octads
called “sarcinae” (singular, sarcina). Tetrads are formed by
Micrococcus tetragenus, a cause of pulmonary infections
(Fig. 3.31).



Septation of rod-shaped cells. In rod-shaped cells, unlike

cocci, cell division requires the envelope to elongate before
septation, followed by the formation of a new polar envelope for each progeny cell. The process of septation involves
an intricate series of molecular signals that is at the frontier
of current research. Mutations in a gene such as ftsZ cause
E. coli to form long fi laments instead of dividing normally.
This fi lamentation results from a failure to form a septum
between cells. The mutant genes causing this behavior





To Summarize


DNA is organized in the nucleoid. The
bacterial DNA is generally attached to the
envelope at the origin of replication, on
the cell’s equator. Loops of DNA called
domains are supercoiled and bound to
DNA-binding proteins.

During transcription, the ribosome translates RNA
to make proteins. Proteins are folded by chaperones
and in some cases secreted at the cell membrane.
Membrane-inserted proteins are translated at the
membrane. The coupling of transcription, translation,
and membrane insertion expands the nucleoid into distal parts of the cell.
DNA is replicated bidirectionally by the replisome.
During bacterial DNA replication, genes continue transcription and translation.
Cell expansion and septation are coordinated with
DNA replication. Septation may occur in one plane
(forming a chain of cells) or at right angles to the previous septation (forming a tetrad).

Cell Polarity and Aging

Are bacterial cells symmetrical? Some bacteria have different structures at either pole, and their cell division generates
two different cell types. But even superficially symmetrical
bacilli such as E. coli show underlying chemical and physical asymmetry. The two cell poles differ in their origin and
age—a phenomenon called polar aging. Polar aging has
surprising consequences for the interactions of bacteria
with their environment and for antibiotic resistance.

Bacterial Cell Differentiation

Bacteria whose poles have different structures generate
two different forms of progeny. The wetland bacterium

attaches to sediment and then immediately starts to
replicate its DNA and divides, producing a f lagellated
daughter cell, as well as a daughter cell containing the
original stalk.
How does C. crescentus organize itself to produce two
different cell types, each with a different organelle at one
pole? The process is a rudimentary form of cell differentiation, comparable to the differentiation processes
that animal cells undergo in the embryo. The process
has been studied through genetic analysis (introduced in
Section 3.1).
The C. crescentus life cycle is governed by regulator proteins such as TipN, studied by students of Christine JacobsWagner at Yale University (see eTopic 3.3). Mutants lacking
TipN make serious mistakes in development. Instead of
making a single flagellum at the correct cell pole, the cell
makes multiple flagella at various locations, even on the
stalk (Fig. 3.33A). Jacobs-Wagner proposed that TipN is
a landmark protein that correctly marks the site of a new
cell pole, and the polar placement of flagella. Figure 3.33B
shows cells expressing TipN fused to GFP, which is then
detected by fluorescence. The fluorescent TipN-GFP localizes to the cell pole opposite the stalk. As the cell prepares
to divide, TipN leaves the pole, delocalizing around the
cell; but it relocalizes at the septum, where the new poles
appear.

delocalizes and then localizes at the
cell equator, midway between poles.

new poles, each containing TipN. The

Cell development involves many such proteins working together. Figure 3.34 shows how TipN interacts
with two other polar proteins: the f lagellar marker PodJ,
and the stalk marker DivJ. Each young cell (swarmer cell
at top of cycle) has a new pole containing TipN. PodJ
migrates to the pole with TipN. The stalk marker DivJ is
produced at the pole where PodJ was previously. These
redistributions of proteins cause the f lagellated swarmer
cell to lose its f lagellum, replacing it with a stalk as the
cell settles in a favorable environment. As the stalked cell
grows, TipN delocalizes around the cell; then it localizes
again at the middle, where the cell septates and divides.
Once division is complete, TipN concentrates at both
new poles. As PodJ moves to the new pole, that pole
grows a f lagellum. Overall, throughout the cycle a series
of polar proteins localize and delocalize to define the
polar functions.
Thought Question

3.8 Figure 3.33 presents data from an experiment that
allows the function of the TipN protein of Caulobacter to be
visualized by microscopy. Can you propose an experiment with
mutant strains of Caulobacter to test the hypothesis that one
of the proteins shown in Figure 3.34 is required for one of the
cell changes shown?

Polar Aging

Does an apparently symmetrical cell such as E. coli actually
show polar differences? In fact, the actual process of cell
division generates daughter cells with chemically different
poles (Fig. 3.35). Each cell starts out with one “old” pole
(red in the figure) and one “new” pole (blue) where the
parental cell septated. As the next cell divides, two daughter
cells form, each with another “new” pole. But meanwhile,
the “old” poles continue to age. With each generation, the
polar cell wall material degrades slightly, increasing the
chance of cell lysis. In a population of E. coli under environmental stress, at each cell division some members of the
population die—of polar old age.
The cause of polar aging in stressed E. coli is the preferential accumulation of protein aggregates, which are
nonfunctional and cannot be unfolded or degraded. For
unknown reasons, proteins aggregate more frequently
under a stress condition, such as low pH, or the presence
of an antibiotic. Proteins damaged by a stress condition are
packed away in the cell’s older pole, allowing the new-pole
cells to remain intact and grow faster.
Why does polar aging matter? One consequence of polar
aging is that cells of different polar ages may differ in their
resistance to antibiotics. This phenomenon could cause
problems for antibiotic therapy, as discussed in Special
Topic 3.1. Mycobacterium tuberculosis shows an extreme

The poles of a bacterial cell may
differ in form and function. Caulobacter crescentus has one plain pole,
and one pole that has either a flagellum
or a stalk. A stalked cell fissions to produce one stalked cell and one flagellar
cell.
The two bacterial poles differ in age.
One pole arises from the septum of the
parental cell, whereas the other pole
arises from a parental pole.
In E. coli, successive cell divisions
yield progeny with a mixture of
polar ages. Cells with a very old pole
may cease replication and die.
Polar aging is increased by stress.
Environmental stress, such as an
antibiotic or low pH, causes protein
aggregates to collect at the cell’s older
pole.
In actinomycetes and mycobacteria,
cells extend at the poles, which alternate between fast and slow extension.
Mycobacterial cells can thus reverse
polar aging.

version of alternate polar aging that generates variable resistance to antibiotics. The result may give tuberculosis bacteria the opportunity to “try out” resistance to various
antibiotics applied in chemotherapy.
Gram-positive bacteria show other adaptations of polar
asymmetry. Spore formers such as Bacillus species can
undergo an asymmetrical cell division to form an endospore at one end. In this process, one daughter nucleoid
forms an inert endospore capable of remaining dormant
but viable for many years (discussed in Chapter 4). Other
species expand their cells by extending one pole only. The
actinomycete Corynebacterium glutamicum, a soil bacterium useful for industrial production, has its replisome
at one cell pole. In Corynebacterium, as DNA replication
begins, a second replisome moves to the opposite pole,
while new cell wall forms at the poles. Unequal or unipolar cell extension is common among actinomycetes and
mycobacteria.

Specialized Structures

We have introduced the major structures that all cells need
to contain and organize their contents, maintain their
DNA, and synthesize new parts. Besides these fundamental structures, different species have evolved specialized devices adapted to diverse metabolic strategies and
environments.

Thylakoids, Carboxysomes,
and Storage Granules

Photosynthetic bacteria, also called phototrophs, produce
food and oxygen for marine and aquatic ecosystems. In the
water, phototrophs must collect as much light as possible
to drive photosynthesis (see Section 14.6). To maximize
the collecting area of their photosynthetic membranes,
phototrophs have evolved specialized systems of extensively folded intracellular membrane called thylakoids

THE MICROBIAL CELL

SPECIAL TOPIC 3.1, , Senior Cells Make Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis, caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is a
global health problem—amplified by the specter of resistance to nearly every known antibiotic. Effective treatment
of tuberculosis can require months or years of therapy with
multiple antibiotics, and when treatment lapses, resistant
strains appear. How do cells become resistant so fast? The
secret may lie in the diversity of growth phenotypes that arise
from the unusual course of cell division in mycobacteria. The
diverse growth states cause different cells to resist different
antibiotics.
At the Harvard School of Public Health, microbiologist
Sarah Fortune (Fig. 1A) and her students designed an experiment to test the hypothesis that different growth states of
mycobacteria have different antibiotic sensitivities. First, Fortune established a way to grow the bacteria in a microfluidic
chamber. The chamber contains ridges to keep the growing cells in place during many hours of perfusion with fresh
medium. The chamber was used to observe growth starting
with a single isolated cell of M. tuberculosis, or of M. smegmatis, a nonpathogenic model organism with very similar growth
traits.
In Figure 1B, a single septating cell is labeled with a green
fluorophore, while new cell growth appears red. If this cell
were E. coli, what would happen? The newly septated E. coli

(Fig. 3.36A). Thylakoids consist of layers of folded sheets
(lamellae) or tubes of membranes packed with chlorophylls
and electron carriers. Cyanobacteria containing thylakoids structurally resemble eukaryotic chloroplasts, which
evolved from a common ancestor of modern cyanobacteria.
The thylakoids conduct only the “light reactions” of photon absorption and energy storage. The energy obtained is

rapidly spent to fix carbon dioxide—a process that occurs
within carboxysomes. Carboxysomes are polyhedral, protein-covered bodies packed with the enzyme Rubisco for
CO2 fixation.
How do phototrophs keep themselves at the top of
the water column? Gas vesicles increase buoyancy and
keep the cell afloat. Figure 3.36B shows a cross section

cells would each expand throughout, like a balloon, and septate again. But the mycobacterial cell does no such thing.
Instead, each cell extends only at its old pole (2 h). Once
growth from the old poles is complete, the cell divides (5 h)
and the “new poles” start to elongate. In other words, each
cell alternates between elongating from an old pole and then
elongating from the opposite pole.
The process of alternating pole extension yields classes of
cells that differ in their growth traits (Fig. 2A). The daughter
cell arising from the rapidly extended pole is called an “accelerator.” The daughter cell left behind at the alternate pole
(composed mainly of old material) is called an “alternator.”
The alternator cell delays a generation and then extends its
older pole. The alternator grows more slowly than the accelerator. Differing in both growth rate and size, the alternator
and accelerator cells were expected to show distinctly different patterns of metabolism. These metabolic states are
assigned age classes: age 1 and age 2, respectively.
In the next generation, division of the alternator cell again
yields cells of the classes age 1 and age 2. But division of the
accelerator cell yields a superaccelerator that extends even
faster than the parent; this metabolic class is called age 3.
Figure 2B shows some of the data that demonstrate the statistical differences in growth rate among cells observed in

the three age classes. Subsequent cell divisions of age 3 cells
yield mixed data, Fortune reports; at some point, an unknown
mechanism resets the growth rate to that of the ancestral
cell. Thus, mycobacterial cells (unlike E. coli) can reverse polar
aging.
How do these different cell types respond to antibiotics?
Fortune compared the survival rates of alternator and accelerator cells. Alternator cells showed greater resistance to the
antibiotics cycloserine and meropenem, which inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis. This makes sense because alternator cells
form relatively small amounts of cell wall, compared to the
rapidly extending accelerator cells. On the other hand, accelerator cells were more resistant to rifampicin, which inhibits
RNA polymerase. The rifampicin sensitivity of alternator cells
might be explained by the rapid RNA turnover required to initiate extension of the alternate pole.
Overall, we see that the “senior cells” from mycobacterial
cell division play distinctive roles in generating antibiotic resis-

factors besides polar age remain to be discovered. No doubt,
the mycobacterial cell cycle has further surprises in store for
medical researchers developing therapies to cure and curb
the spread of tuberculosis.

When light is scarce, phototrophs may digest their thylakoids for energy and as a source of nitrogen. Alternatively,
the cell may digest energy-rich materials from storage granules composed of glycogen or other polymers, such as
polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and poly-3-hydroxyalkanoate (PHA). PHB and PHA polymers are of interest as biodegradable plastics, and bacteria have been engineered to

produce them industrially. Similar storage granules are also
produced by nonphototrophic soil bacteria.
Another type of storage device is sulfur—granules
of elemental sulfur produced by purple and green phototrophs through photolysis of hydrogen sulfide (H 2S).
Instead of disposing of the sulfur, the bacteria store it
in granules, either within the cytoplasm (purple phototrophs) or as “globules” attached to the outside of the
cell. Sulfur-reducing bacteria also make extracellular sulfur
globules (Fig. 3.37). The sulfur may be usable as an oxidant when reduced substrates become available. And the
presence of potentially toxic sulfur granules may help cells
avoid predation.

A common adherence structure is the pilus (plural, pili),
also called fimbria (plural, fimbriae), which is constructed
of straight filaments of protein monomers called pilin.
For example, the sexually transmitted pathogen Neisseria
gonorrhoeae uses pili to attach to the mucous membranes
of the reproductive tract (Fig. 3.38). In Gram-negative
enteric bacteria, pili of a different kind, also called the sex
pili, attach a “male” donor cell to a “female” recipient cell
for transfer of DNA. This process of DNA transfer is called
conjugation. The genetic consequences of conjugation are
discussed in Chapter 9.

Another kind of attachment organelle is a membraneembedded extension of the cytoplasm called a stalk, seen
earlier in the stalked cell of Caulobacter (Fig. 3.32). The
tip of the stalk secretes adhesion factors called holdfasts,
which firmly attach the bacterium in an environment that
has proved favorable. A stalk and holdfast enable iron-oxidizing bacteria to form large orange biofilms. An example is
Gallionella ferruginea, an iron-oxidizing species that grows
long, twisted stalks (Fig. 3.39). The stalks of adherent Gallionella cells become coated by orange iron hydroxides, tinting aquatic streams contaminated by iron drainage.

extracellular polysaccharides, connect cells to form

extensions of cell envelopes that connect the cytoplasm
or periplasm between two different cells. Figure 3.40
shows how nanotubes interconnect cells of Bacillus subtilis. Nanotubes can transmit materials from one cell to
another—even between cells of different species. Unfortunately, viruses can generate nanotubes in their host cells
in order to transmit progeny viruses to a new cell without
exposure to the immune system.

Rotary Flagella

© MARIA FABISCH, 2009

What happens when the cell’s environment runs out of nutrients, or becomes filled with waste? In rapidly changing environments, cell survival requires motility, the ability to move
and relocate. Many bacteria and archaea can swim by means
of rotary flagella (singular, flagellum). Flagellar motility benefits the cell by causing the population to disperse,
decreasing competition. Motility also enables cells to swim
toward a favorable habitat (chemotaxis, discussed shortly.)

moving freshwater stream at Audley in New South Wales, Australia.

Flagellar motility. Flagella are helical propellers that

drive the cell forward like the motor of a boat. Howard
Berg at the California Institute of Technology originally
described the bacterial flagellar motor, which was the fi rst
rotary device to be discovered in a living organism. Different bacterial species have different numbers and arrangements of flagella. Peritrichous cells, such as E. coli and
Salmonella species, have flagella randomly distributed

a motor driven by the cell’s transmembrane
proton current—the same proton potential
that drives the membrane-embedded ATP
synthase (presented in Chapter 14). The
flagellar motor is embedded in the layers
of the cell envelope. The motor possesses
an axle and rotary parts, all composed of
specific proteins. For example, protein
MotB forms part of the ion channel whose flux of hydrogen ions powers rotation, similarly to the proton flux that
drives ATP synthase. Another protein, FliG, forms part of
the device that generates torque (rotary force). Much of
the motor’s structure and function was elucidated by Scottish microbiologist Robert Macnab (1940–2003) at Yale
University.
What kinds of experiments reveal the motor components? An example of an experiment dissecting the flagellar motor is shown in Figure 3.43. Japanese microbiologist
Tohru Minamino and colleagues constructed strains of
Salmonella enterica in which the gene encoding fluorescent
GFP is fused to a gene encoding a flagellar motor protein,
MotB or FliG. Fluorescence microscopy reveals the concentration of GFP fluorescence at one or two positions within
the cell (green dots). A second fluorophore, Alexa, is conjugated to an anti-flagellin antibody. The Alexa fluorescence
(red) reveals the flagellar filament. When the green and red
fluorescence images are merged, the red flagellar filaments

either MotB or FliG. Further experiments dissect the roles
of key amino acid residues in the function of these proteins.

Note:

Bacterial flagella differ completely from the whiplike
flagella and cilia of eukaryotes. Eukaryotic flagella are much larger
structures containing multiple microtubules enclosed by a membrane (shown in Chapter 20). They move with a whiplike motion,
powered by ATP hydrolysis all along the flagellum.

Magnetotactic bacteria are anaerobes or microaerophiles
(require low oxygen), which prefer the lower part of the
water column, where oxygen concentration is lowest. In the
northern latitudes, where Earth’s magnetic field lines point
downward, bacteria that are magnetotactic swim “downward” toward magnetic north.
Thought Question

3.9 How would a magnetotactic species have to behave if
Chemotaxis. How do cells decide where to swim? Most

flagellated cells have an elaborate sensory system for taxis,
the ability to swim toward favorable environments (attractant signals, such as nutrients) and away from inferior environments (repellent signals, such as waste products). Taxis
to specific chemicals is called chemotaxis. For chemotaxis,
the attractants and repellents are detected by a polar array
of chemoreceptors. Chemoreceptors act like a “nose,” telling the bacterium when it is swimming toward a source of
attractant such as a sugar or an amino acid.
Another form of chemotaxis is magnetotaxis, the ability
to sense and respond to magnetism. Found in pond water,
magnetotactic bacteria orient themselves along the Earth’s
lines of magnetic field. Magnetotactic bacteria can be collected from the environment by placing a magnet in a jar
of pond water; bacteria orienting by the field lines collect
nearby. The bacteria sense the magnetic field by means of
magnetosomes, microscopic membrane-embedded crystals of the magnetic mineral magnetite, Fe3O4 (shown in
the previous chapter, Fig. 2.44). The magnetosomes orient bacterial swimming toward the bottom of the pond.

it was in the Southern Hemisphere instead of the Northern
Hemisphere?

Chemotaxis requires a mechanism for the rotary flagella to
propel the cell toward attractants or away from repellents. This
movement is accomplished by flagellar rotation either clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the cell (Fig. 3.44A).
When a cell is swimming toward an attractant chemical, the
flagella rotate counterclockwise (CCW), enabling the cell to
swim smoothly for a long stretch. When the cell veers away
from the attractant, receptors send a signal that allows one
or more flagella to switch rotation clockwise (CW), against
the twist of the helix. This switch in the direction of rotation disrupts the bundle of flagella, causing the cell to tumble briefly and end up pointed in a random direction. The
cell then swims off in the new direction. The resulting pattern of movement generates a “biased random walk” in which
the cell tends to migrate toward the attractant (Fig. 3.44B).
How do bacteria connect their flagellar switching mechanism
to the signal reception of their chemoreceptors? The signal
transduction mechanism is explained in Chapter 10.

 Chemotaxis. A. Flagella are oriented in a bundle
extending behind one pole. When the cell veers away from the attractant, the receptors send a signal that allows one or more flagella
to switch rotation from counterclockwise (CCW) to clockwise (CW).
This switched rotation disrupts the bundle of flagella, causing the
cell to tumble briefly before it swims off in a new direction. B. The
pattern of movement is a “biased random walk” in which the cell
sometimes moves randomly but overall tends to migrate toward the
attractant.

Besides motility and chemotaxis, surprisingly, flagella
have also evolved an alternate function: adherence of
cells to a substrate to begin forming a biofilm (discussed
in Chapter 4). Thus, an organism can evolve a structure
that serves one function but later evolves to serve another
function.

To Summarize




Thought Question

3.10 Most laboratory strains of E. coli and Salmonella com-



monly used for genetic research lack flagella. Why do you think
this is the case? How can a researcher maintain a motile strain?

In addition to flagellar rotation, other forms of bacterial
motility are just beginning to be understood. For example,
“twitching motility” is a process by which bacteria such as
Pseudomonas aeruginosa use pili to drag themselves across
a surface. Twitching motility is involved in biofilm formation (discussed in Section 4.5). Another kind of motility, called “gliding,” is observed in cyanobacteria and in
myxobacteria.





Phototrophs possess thylakoid membrane organelles
packed with photosynthetic apparatus and carboxysomes for carbon dioxide fixation. Gas vesicles provide
buoyancy in the water column.
Storage granules store sulfur or carbon polymers for
energy.
Adherence structures enable prokaryotes to remain
in an environment with favorable environmental factors. Major adherence structures include pili or fimbriae (protein filaments), and the holdfast (a cell
extension).
Flagellar motility involves rotary motion of helical
flagella.
Chemoreceptors and magnetosomes provide information that directs flagellar motility. Chemotaxis is
a mechanism by which the cell migrates up a gradient of an attractant substance or down a gradient of
repellents.

here do bacteria find food, and how do
they grow? Bacteria struggle to survive in
natural habitats because they constantly
compete for food. Over eons, however, evolution
has enabled bacteria to find new nutritional niches
that require the microbes to consume strange foods
(mothballs, for instance), harness energy from light, or
survive boiling temperatures around deep-sea thermal
vents. In the process, single-celled organisms developed ways to chemically “talk” to each other and form
intricate multicellular communities called biofilms. The
one process that links all of these activities is growth.

Evolution in aging colonies. Bacteria in old colonies struggle
to survive because nutrients dwindle and toxic products rise.
Ivan Matic and Claude Saint-Ruf found aging colonies to be
breeding grounds for diversity. This 10-day-old E. coli colony
has numerous mutant islands expressing different patterns
of two fluorescent proteins (green and red). Inset: An island
with dead cells (blue) in the center surrounded by growing

How have studies on aging colonies
altered our view of bacterial diversity?
The capacity of microbes to colonize
practically all environmental niches on
Earth fascinates us. Our work demonstrates that microhabitats within structured environments are important for
shaping this diversity. For instance,
environmental parameters of microhabitats in a bacterial colony continuously change as a
consequence of bacterial activity. The disparate selective
pressures that result favor the emergence and coexistence
of diverse variants that could evolve to inhabit new environmental niches. In a homogeneous environment, by contrast,
natural selection reduces diversity by eliminating all but the
fittest variants.

how heritable antibiotic tolerance develops even in the

FIGURE 4.2  The carbon cycle. The carbon cycle requires both autotrophs and heterotrophs. A. Heterotrophs gain energy from degrading complex organic compounds (such as polysaccharides) to smaller compounds (such as glucose and pyruvate). The carbon from pyruvate
moves through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and is released as CO2. In the absence of a TCA cycle, the carbon can end up as fermentation
products, such as ethanol or acetic acid. B. Autotrophs use light energy or energy derived from the oxidation of minerals to capture CO2 and
convert it to complex organic molecules. C. Chloroflexus aggregans, originally isolated from hot springs in Japan, possesses extraordinary
metabolic versatility. It grows anaerobically (without oxygen) as a photoheterotroph and aerobically (with oxygen) as a chemoheterotroph.

Essential nutrients are those compounds that a microbe
must have but cannot make. The organism needs to find and
import these nutrients from the immediate environment.
When an essential nutrient becomes depleted, microbes
cannot grow. How organisms cope with these periods of
starvation until nutrients are restored will be discussed later.
All microorganisms require a minimum set of macronutrients, nutrients needed in large quantities (as discussed in Chapter 3). Six macronutrients—carbon, nitrogen,
phosphorus, hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur—make up
the carbohydrates, lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins of
the cell. Four other macronutrients are cations that serve
as cofactors for specific enzymes (Mg2+, Fe2+, and K+)
or act as regulatory signaling molecules (Ca2+). All cells also
require very small amounts of certain trace elements, called
micronutrients. These include cobalt, copper, manganese,
molybdenum, nickel, and zinc, which are ubiquitous trace
contaminants on glassware and in water. As a result, these
elements are not added to laboratory media unless heroic
measures have been taken to first remove the elements from
the medium. Micronutrients are required by cells as essential
components of enzymes or cofactors. Cobalt, for example, is
part of the cofactor vitamin B12.
Some organisms, such as the common laboratory bacterium E. coli, make all their proteins, nucleic acids, and cell wall
and membrane components from this very simple blend of
chemical elements and compounds. For many other microbes,
this basic set of nutrients is insufficient. Borrelia burgdorferi,

for example, the cause of Lyme disease, requires an extensive
mixture of complex organic supplements to grow.

Microbes Build Biomass through
Autotrophy or Heterotrophy

Maintaining life on this planet is an amazing process. All of
Earth’s life-forms are based on carbon, which they acquire
through delicately choreographed processes that recycle
key nutrients. The carbon cycle, a critical part of this process, involves two counterbalancing kinds of metabolism:
heterotrophy and autotrophy. The metabolic details of
these pathways are discussed later, in Chapters 13 and 14.
Heterotrophs (such as E. coli) rely on other organisms
to form the organic compounds (such as glucose) that
they use as carbon sources. Most heterotrophs are organotrophs. Organotrophy is a form of metabolism in which
organic carbon sources are disassembled in ways that generate energy and then reassembled to make cell constituents
such as proteins and carbohydrates (Fig. 4.2A). This process converts a large amount of the organic carbon source
to CO2, which is then released to the atmosphere. Thus,
left on their own, heterotrophs would deplete the world of
organic carbon sources (converting them to unusable CO2)
and then starve to death. For life to continue, CO2 must be
recycled.
Autotrophs (such as cyanobacteria) assimilate CO2
as a carbon source, reducing it (adding hydrogen atoms)

to generate complex cell constituents made up of C, H,
and O (for example, carbohydrates, which have the general formula CH 2O) (Fig. 4.2B). When autotrophs later
die or are eaten, these organic compounds can be used
as carbon sources by heterotrophs. Autotrophs are classified as photoautotrophs or chemolithoautotrophs by how
they obtain energy. Photoautotrophs use light energy to
fix CO2 into biomass, whereas chemolithoautotrophs fix
CO2 using chemical reactions without light. Most chemolithoautotrophs gain energy by oxidizing inorganic substances such as iron or ammonia (described next). Both
photoautotrophs and chemolithoautotrophs carry out the
autotrophic process of CO2 fixation, which forms part of
the carbon cycle between autotrophs and heterotrophs
(Fig. 4.2). In addition, many microorganisms (for example, phototrophic soil bacteria) can use both heterotrophy
and autotrophy to gain carbon.
Thought Question

4.1 In a mixed ecosystem of autotrophs and heterotrophs,
what happens if the autotroph begins to outgrow the
heterotroph and makes excess organic carbon?

Microbes Obtain Energy through
Phototrophy or Chemotrophy

Although the macronutrients mentioned earlier (C, N, P,
H, O, and S) provide the essential building blocks to make
proteins and other cell structures, all synthetic processes
require an energy source. Depending on the organism,
energy can be obtained from chemical reactions triggered
by the absorption of light (phototrophy, or photosynthesis) or from oxidation-reduction reactions that transfer
electrons from high-energy compounds to make products
of lower energy (chemotrophy), capturing the energy difference to do work. Chemotrophic organisms fall into two
classes that use different sources of electron donors: lithotrophs (also called chemolithotrophs) and organotrophs
(chemoorganotrophs). Lithotrophs remove electrons (oxidize) inorganic chemicals (for example, H 2, H 2S, NH4+,
NO2 –, and Fe2+) for energy, whereas organotrophs oxidize
organic compounds (for example, sugars). Oxidation and
reduction is reviewed in eAppendix 1.
What if a microbe conducts more than one type of
metabolism? Many free-living soil and aquatic bacteria
can obtain energy from heterotrophy, lithotrophy, and
phototrophy, all in one cell. Such microbes are called
mixotrophs or photoheterotrophs. A photoheterotroph
has multiple gene systems that are expressed under different conditions and yield products that carry out different
functions. For example, Rhodospirillum rubrum grows by
photoheterotrophy when light is available and oxygen is

absent, but by respiration, without absorbing light, when
O2 is available.

Note:

The following prefixes for “-trophy” terms help distinguish
different forms of biomass-building and energy-yielding metabolism.
Carbon source for biomass:
Auto-: CO2 is fixed and assembled into organic molecules.
Hetero-: Preformed organic molecules are acquired from outside, broken down for carbon, and the carbon reassembled to
make biomass.

Energy source:
Photo-: Light absorption captures energy.
Chemo-: Chemical electron donors are oxidized.
Electron source:
Litho-: Inorganic molecules donate electrons.
Organo-: Organic molecules donate electrons.

In chemotrophy, the amount of energy harvested from
oxidizing a compound depends on the compound’s reduction state. The more reduced the compound is, the more
electrons it has to give up and the higher is the potential
energy yield. A reduced compound, such as glucose, can
donate electrons to a less reduced (more oxidized) compound, such as nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD),
releasing energy (in the form of donated electrons) and
becoming oxidized in the process. NAD is a cell molecule
critical to energy metabolism and is discussed, along with
oxidation-reduction reactions, in Chapter 13.
In short, microbes are classified on the basis of their carbon and energy acquisition as follows:


Autotroph (autotrophy). Autotrophs build biomass by
fi xing CO2 into complex organic molecules. Autotrophs
gain energy through one of two general metabolic routes
that either use or ignore light.
Photoautotroph
(photoautotrophy).
Photoautotrophs generate energy through light absorption by the
photolysis (light-activated breakdown) of H 2O or H 2S.
The energy is used to fix CO2 into biomass.
Chemolithoautotroph
(chemolithoautotrophy).
Chemolithoautotrophs produce energy from oxidizing
inorganic molecules such as iron, sulfur, or nitrogen.
This energy is used to fix CO2 into biomass.



Heterotroph (heterotrophy). Heterotrophs break
down organic compounds from other organisms to gain
energy and to harvest carbon for building their own
biomass. Heterotrophic metabolism can be divided into
two classes, also based on whether light is involved.
Photoheterotroph (photoheterotrophy). Photoheterotrophs obtain energy from the catabolism of organic
compounds and through light absorption. Organic
compounds are broken down and used to build biomass.

Chemoheterotroph (chemoheterotrophy or organotrophy). Chemoheterotrophs obtain energy and carbon
for biomass solely from organic compounds. Chemoheterotrophy is also called chemoorganotrophy or, commonly, just heterotrophy.
The survival and metabolism of any one group of organisms depend on the survival and metabolism of other groups
of organisms. For example, the cyanobacteria, a type of
photosynthetic microorganism that originated 2.5–3.5 billion years ago, produce most of the oxygen that we breathe.
Cyanobacteria also depend on heterotrophic bacteria to
consume the molecular oxygen that the cyanobacteria produce, since molecular oxygen is toxic to cyanobacteria.
A present-day cyanobacteria-containing ecosystem that
may resemble that of ancient Earth is the polar desert Mars
Oasis, on Alexander Island, Antarctica (Fig. 4.3). In this
harsh habitat, cyanobacteria grow in soil and even as “endoliths” within rock. In the soil we find heterotrophs such as
Paenibacillus wynnii. P. wynnii consumes oxygen to catabolize many carbohydrates to CO2, and also fixes its own
nitrogen from the atmosphere. The bacteria can make endospores (see Section 4.6), which survive during long periods
of dormancy, such as the Antarctic winter. Researchers set
up experiments to test the effect of heating the soil, as a
simulation of climate change, on the ecosystem.
Today, cyanobacteria form the base of Earth’s marine
food chain. The autotrophic cyanobacteria fix carbon in
the ocean and are eaten by heterotrophic protists. The
protists are then devoured by fish, and the fish produce
the CO2 fixed by the cyanobacteria. And eventually, we
eat the fish.

Energy Is Stored for Later Use

Whatever the source, energy, once obtained, must be
converted to a form useful to the cell. This form can be
chemical energy, such as that contained in the high-energy
phosphate bonds in adenosine triphosphate (ATP), or it can
be electrochemical energy, which is stored in the form of
an electrical potential generated between compartments
separated by a membrane (see Chapter 14). Energy stored
by an electrical potential across the membrane is known as
the membrane potential. A membrane potential is generated when chemical (or light) energy is used to pump protons outside of the cell, making the proton concentration
greater outside the cell than inside. For example, membrane
proteins such as cytochrome oxidases use energy from respiration to pump hydrogen ions across the cell membrane,
generating a hydrogen ion gradient. This movement of positively charged ions produces an electrical gradient across
the cell membrane, making the inside of the cell more negatively charged than the outside. The hydrogen ion gradient plus the charge difference (voltage potential) across the
membrane form an electrochemical potential. Because
this electrochemical potential includes the hydrogen ion
gradient, it is called the proton potential, or proton
motive force. The energy stored in the proton motive force
can be used by specific transport proteins to move nutrients
into the cell (see Section 3.3), to directly drive motors that
rotate flagella, and to drive the synthesis of ATP by a membrane-embedded ATP synthase (Fig. 4.4A).
The membrane-embedded F-ATP synthase, also called
F1Fo ATP synthase, provides most of the ATP for aerobic
respiring cells such as E. coli. Essentially the same complex

mediates ATP generation in our own mitochondria. ATP
synthase is a complex of many different proteins. The
enzyme includes a channel (Fo) that allows H+ to move
across the membrane and drive rotation of the ATP synthase complex (F1). Rotation of F1 mediates the formation
of ATP. The role of the proton potential in metabolism is
discussed in detail in Chapters 13 and 14.
The idea that a living organism could contain rotating
parts was controversial when such parts were first discovered in bacterial flagella (discussed in Section 3.6). The
discovery of rotary biomolecules has inspired advances in
nanotechnology, the engineering of microscopic devices.
For example, a “biomolecular motor” was devised using an
ATP synthase F1 complex to drive a metal submicroscopic
propeller (Fig. 4.4B). In the future, such biomolecular
design may be used to build microscopic robots that enter
the bloodstream to perform microsurgery.

Nitrogen is an essential component of proteins, nucleic
acids, and other cellular constituents, and as such, is
required in large amounts by living organisms. So how
do bacteria get nitrogen? Nitrogen gas (N2) makes up
nearly 79% of Earth’s atmosphere, but most organisms
are unable to use nitrogen gas, because the triple bond
between the two nitrogen atoms is highly stable and
requires considerable energy to be broken. For nitrogen to be used for growth, it must first be “fixed,” or
converted to ammonium ions (NH4 +). Nitrogen gas is
converted to NH4 + by nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The
ammonium is then used by all microbes to make amino
acids and other nitrogenous compounds needed for
growth.

CHAPTER 4



BACTERIAL CULTURE, GROWTH, AND DEVELOPMENT

Nitrogen-fixing bacteria may be free-living in soil or
water, or they may form symbiotic associations with plants
or other organisms. A symbiont is an organism that lives in
intimate association with a second organism. For example,
Rhizobium, Sinorhizobium, and Bradyrhizobium species
are nitrogen-fixing symbionts of leguminous plants such as
soybeans, chickpeas, and clover (Fig. 4.5). Although symbionts are the most widely known nitrogen-fixing bacteria,
the majority of nitrogen in soil and marine environments is
fixed by free-living bacteria and archaea.
Once fixed, how does nitrogen get back into the atmosphere? As with the carbon cycle, various groups of organisms collaborate to recycle ammonium ions and nitrate
ions (NO3 –) into nitrogen gas in what is called the nitrogen cycle, and they collect energy in the process (Fig. 4.6).
One group of bacteria gains energy by converting, or oxidizing, ammonia to form nitrate in a process called nitrification (Nitrosomonas, Alcaligenes, and Nitrobacter).
Nitrification is a form of lithotrophy. Other heterotrophic
microbes (Paracoccus) can reduce nitrate to N2 via denitrification, a process that uses nitrate and related inorganic forms of nitrogen as terminal electron acceptors
for certain electron transport chains. Denitrifying bacteria send an amount of nitrogen into the atmosphere that
roughly balances the amount removed by nitrogen fixation. Like the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle illustrates
how nature manages to replenish planet Earth. For the
environmental significance of nitrogen metabolism, see
Chapter 22.

To Summarize














Microorganisms require certain essential macro- and
micronutrients to grow.
Autotrophs use CO2 as a carbon source, either through
photosynthesis or through lithotrophy, and make
organic compounds as biomass.
Heterotrophs consume the organic compounds made
by autotrophs to gain carbon.
Energy gained by autotrophy or chemotrophy is
stored either as proton motive force or chemical energy
(ATP).
Nitrogen fixers (only bacteria and archaea) incorporate
nitrogen into biomass and contribute organic nitrogen
to the rest of the ecosystem.
Chemotrophic nitrifying bacteria gain energy by
converting NH4+ (made by nitrogen-fixing bacteria)
into nitrate and nitrite.
Heterotrophic denitrifying organisms use nitrate and
nitrite as electron acceptors to make nitrogen gas.

4.2

Nutrient Uptake

How do bacteria gather nutrients? Whether a microbe
swims by f lagella toward a favorable habitat or, lacking
motility, drifts through its environment, the organism
must be able to find nutrients and move them across the
membrane into the cytoplasm. The membrane, however,
presents a daunting obstacle. Membranes are designed to
separate what is outside the cell from what is inside. So,
for a cell to gain sustenance from the environment, the
membrane must be selectively permeable to nutrients the
cell can use. A few compounds, such as oxygen and carbon dioxide, can passively diffuse across the membrane,
but most cannot. Selective permeability is achieved in
three ways:


Substrate-specific carrier proteins (permeases) in the
membrane



Nutrient-binding proteins that patrol the periplasmic
space



Membrane-spanning protein channels, or pores, that
discriminate between substrates

Microbes must also overcome the problem of low
nutrient concentrations in the natural environment (for
example, lakes or streams). If the intracellular concentration of nutrients were no greater than the extracellular

concentration, the cell would remain starved of most
nutrients. To solve this dilemma, most organisms have
evolved efficient transport systems that concentrate
nutrients inside the cell relative to outside. However,
moving molecules against a concentration gradient
requires some form of energy.
In contrast to environments where nutrients are available but exist at low concentrations (for example, aqueous
environments), certain habitats have plenty of nutrients
but those nutrients are locked in a form that cannot be
transported into the cell. Starch, a large, complex carbohydrate, is but one example. Many microbes unlock
these nutrient “vaults” by secreting digestive enzymes
that break down complex carbohydrates or other molecules into smaller compounds that are easier to transport. The amazing mechanisms that cells use to extrude
these large digestive proteins through the membrane
and into their surrounding environment are discussed in
Chapter 8.

Facilitated Diffusion

Although most transport systems use cellular energy to
bring compounds into the cell, a few do not. Facilitated
diffusion uses the concentration gradient of a compound
to move that compound across the membrane from a compartment of higher concentration to a compartment of
lower concentration. The best these passive systems can do
is to equalize the internal and external concentrations of a
solute; facilitated transport cannot move a molecule against
its gradient. Facilitated diffusion systems are used for compounds that are either too large or too polar to diffuse on
their own.

The most important facilitated diffusion transporters
are those of the aquaporin family that transport water and
small polar molecules such as glycerol (which is used for
energy and for building phospholipids). Glycerol transport
is performed by an integral membrane protein in E. coli
called GlpF. The structure of a glycerol channel is shown in
Figure 4.7A, where the complex is viewed from the outer
face of the membrane. The complex is a tetramer of four
channels, each of which transports a glycerol.
In the membrane, GlpF reversibly (and randomly)
assumes two conformations. One form exposes the
glycerol-binding site to the external environment, whereas
the second form exposes this site to the cytoplasm. When the
concentration of glycerol is greater outside than inside the
cell, the form with the binding site exposed to the exterior
is more likely to find and bind glycerol. After binding glycerol, GlpF changes shape, closing itself to the exterior and
opening to the interior (Fig. 4.7B). Bound glycerol is then
released (diffuses) into the cytoplasm (influx). Of course,
this form of GlpF could also bind a glycerol molecule in
the cytoplasm and release it outside the cell. Thus, once
the cytoplasmic concentration of glycerol equals the concentration outside the cell, bound glycerol can be released
to either compartment. However, facilitated diffusion normally promotes glycerol influx, because the cell consumes
the compound as it enters the cytoplasm, keeping cytoplasmic concentrations of glycerol low.

Active Transport Requires Energy

Most forms of transport expend energy to take up molecules from outside the cell and concentrate them inside.
The ability to import nutrients against their natural

concentration gradients is critical in aquatic habitats, where
nutrient concentrations are low, and in soil habitats, where
competition for nutrients is high.
The simplest way to use energy to move molecules across
a membrane is to exchange the energy of one chemical
gradient for that of another. The most common chemical
gradients used are those of ions, particularly the positively
charged ions Na+ and K+. These ions are kept at different
concentrations on either side of the cell membrane. When
an ion moves down its concentration gradient (from high
to low), energy is released. Some transport proteins harness
that free energy and use it to drive transport of a second
molecule up, or against, its concentration gradient in the
process called coupled transport.
The two types of coupled transport systems are symport, in which the two molecules travel in the same direction (Fig. 4.8A), and antiport, in which the actively
transported molecule moves in the direction opposite
that of the driving ion (Fig. 4.8B). An example of a symporter is the lactose permease LacY of E. coli, one of the
first transport proteins to have its function elucidated.
This work was carried out by the pioneering membrane
biochemist H. Ronald Kaback (Fig. 4.8C). LacY moves
lactose inward, powered by a proton that is also moving
inward (symport). LacY proton-driven transport is said to

be electrogenic because an unequal distribution of charge
results (for example, symport of a neutral lactose molecule
with H+ results in net movement of positive charge).
An example of electroneutral coupled transport, in
which there is no net transfer of charge, is that of the Na+/
H+ antiporter. The Na+/H+ antiporter couples the export
of Na+ with the import of a proton (antiport). Because molecules of like charges are merely exchanged, there is no net
movement of charge. Sodium exchange is important for all
organisms and is particularly critical for organisms living in
high-salt habitats (see Section 5.4).
Thought Questions

4.2 In what situation would antiport and symport be passive
rather than active transport?
4.3 What kind of transporter, other than an antiporter, could
produce electroneutral coupled transport?

Symport and antiport transporter proteins function by
alternately opening one end or the other of a channel that
spans the cell membrane. The channel contains solute-binding sites (Fig. 4.8A and B). When the channel is open to the
high-concentration side of the membrane, the driving ion

126



PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

(solute) attaches to the binding sites. The transport protein
then changes shape to open that site to the low-concentration
side of the membrane, and the ion leaves. When and where
the second (cotransported) solute binds depends on whether
the transport protein is an antiporter or a symporter.
With all this ion traffic across the membrane going on, a
careful accounting must be kept of how many ions are inside
the cell relative to outside. The cell must recirculate ions
back and forth across the membrane to maintain certain
gradients if the organism is to survive. Because key ATPproducing systems require an electrochemical gradient
across the membrane, it is especially important to keep the
interior of the cell negatively charged relative to the exterior. However, because the movement of many compounds
is coupled to the import of positive ions, the electrochemical gradient will eventually dissipate, or depolarize, unless
positive ions are also exported. Depolarization must be
avoided, because a depolarized cell loses membrane integrity and cannot carry out the transport functions needed
to sustain growth. A healthy cell maintains a proper charge
balance by using the electron transport chain to move protons out of the cell and by using antiporters to exchange
negatively and positively charged ions as needed.
While symport and antiport systems directly link the
transport of different ions, the movement of one ion can
also be linked indirectly to movement of another molecule.
For example, proton concentrations are typically greater
outside the cell than inside. The inwardly directed proton
gradient is called proton motive force. Proton motive force
can impel the exit of Na+ through the Na+/H+ antiporter.
The resulting Na+ gradient can then drive the symport of
amino acids into the cell. In this case, Na+ moves back into
the cell down its gradient, and the energy released is tied to
the import of an amino acid against its gradient.

ABC Transporters Are Powered by ATP

As we pointed out in Section 3.2, a major function of
proton transport is to form the proton motive force that

powers ATP synthesis (for details on the proton motive
force, see Chapter 14). The energy stored in ATP can then
drive membrane transport of nutrients.
The largest family of energy-driven transport systems is the
ATP-binding cassette superfamily, also known as ABC transporters. These transporters are found in bacteria, archaea,
and eukaryotes. All of them appear to have arisen from a common ancestral porter, so they share a considerable amount of
amino acid sequence homology. Many different ABC transporters mediate the transport of a wide variety of substrates.
It is impressive that nearly 5% of the E. coli genome
is dedicated to producing the components of 70 different varieties of uptake and efflux ABC transporters. The
uptake ABC transporters are critical for transporting nutrients such as maltose, histidine, arabinose, and galactose.
The efflux ABC transporters are generally used as multidrug efflux pumps that allow microbes to survive exposures to hazardous chemicals. Lactococcus, for example, can
use a pump called LmrP to export a broad range of antibiotics, including tetracyclines, streptogramins, quinolones,
macrolides, and aminoglycosides, thus conferring resistance to those drugs (see Section 27.3).
An ABC transporter typically consists of two hydrophobic proteins that form a membrane channel and two cytoplasmic proteins that contain a highly conserved amino acid
motif, called the ATP-binding cassette, that binds ATP.
The ABC transporter superfamily contains both uptake and
efflux transport systems. The uptake systems (but not the
efflux systems) possess an additional, extracytoplasmic protein, called a substrate-binding protein, that initially binds
the substrate (also called solute). In Gram-negative bacteria, these substrate-binding proteins float in the periplasmic
space between the inner and outer membranes. In Grampositive bacteria, which lack an outer membrane, the proteins
must be tethered to the cell surface.
ABC transport (Fig. 4.9) starts with the substratebinding protein snagging the appropriate solute, either as it
floats by a Gram-positive microbe or as the molecule enters
the periplasm of a Gram-negative cell. Most substrates

to move the substrate into the periplasm. Because substrate-binding
proteins have a high affinity for their
cognate (matched) solutes, their use
increases the efficiency of transport
when concentrations of solute are low.
Once united with its solute, the
binding protein binds to the periplasmic
face of the channel protein and releases
the solute, which now moves to a site
on the channel protein. This interaction triggers a structural (or conformational) change in the channel protein
(the green “membrane transporter”
in Fig. 4.9) that is telegraphed to the
nucleotide-binding proteins on the
cytoplasmic side (yellow). On receiving
this signal, the nucleotide-binding proteins start hydrolyzing ATP and send a
return conformational change through
the channel, signaling the channel to
open its cytoplasmic side and allow the
solute to enter the cell.

Iron, an essential nutrient of most cells, is
mostly locked up in nature as Fe(OH)3,

solved this transport dilemma by synthesizing and secreting specialized molecules called siderophores (Greek for
“iron bearer”), which have a very high affinity for the small

amounts of soluble ferric iron available in the environment.
These iron scavenger molecules are produced and secreted
by cells when the intracellular iron concentration is low
(Fig. 4.10). In most Gram-negative organisms, the siderophore (for example, enterochelin in E. coli) binds iron in the
environment, and the siderophore-iron complex then attaches
to specific receptors in the outer membrane. At this point,
either the iron is released directly and is passed to other transport proteins or the complex is transported across the cytoplasmic membrane by a dedicated ABC transporter. The iron
is released intracellularly and reduced from Fe3+ to Fe2+ for
biosynthetic use. Other Gram-negative microorganisms, such
as Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the causative agent of gonorrhea), do
not use siderophores at all but employ receptors on their surface that bind human iron complexes (for example, transferrin
or lactoferrin) and wrest the iron from them.
Because microbial iron-transporting proteins are critical
to the pathogenesis of many microbes, solving the molecular

Culturing and
Counting Bacteria

How do we capture bacteria and study them? Microbes
in nature usually exist in complex, intertwined multispecies communities. For detailed studies of a single species,
however, cells of the species are usually grown in pure culture. This section will describe how that is done. But after
120 years of trying to grow microbes in the laboratory,
we have succeeded in culturing less than 1% of the microorganisms around us. The vast majority of the microbial
world has yet to be tamed. At the end of this section we
will discuss some new, innovative methods that enable us
to culture at least some of these “unculturable” microbes.

Bacteria Are Grown in Culture Media

For those organisms that can be cultured, we have access to
a variety of culturing techniques that can be used for different purposes. Bacterial culture media may be either liquid or
solid. A liquid, or broth, medium, in which organisms can
move about freely, is useful for studying the growth characteristics of a single strain of a single species (that is, a pure culture). Liquid media are also convenient for examining growth
kinetics and microbial biochemistry at different phases of
growth. Solid media, usually gelled with agar, are useful for
trying to separate mixtures of different organisms as they are
found in the natural environment or in clinical specimens.

Dilution Streaking and Spread Plates

Solid media are basically liquid media to which a solidifying agent has been added. The most versatile and widely
used solidifying agent is agar (for the development of agar
medium, see Section 1.3). Derived from seaweed, agar
forms an unusual gel that liquefies at 100°C but does not
solidify again until cooled to about 40°C. Liquefied agar
medium poured into shallow, covered petri dishes cools
and hardens to provide a large, flat surface on which a mixture of microorganisms can be streaked to separate individual cells. Each cell will divide and grow to form a distinct,
visible colony of cells (Fig. 4.12).
As shown in Figure 4.13 , a drop of liquid culture is
collected with an inoculating loop and streaked across the
agar plate surface in a pattern called dilution streaking.
Organisms fall off the loop as it moves along the agar surface.

wastewater in Fountain Valley, California (SEM).

Toward the end of the streak, few bacteria remain on the
loop, so individual cells will land and stick to different places
on the agar surface. If the medium, whether artificial (for
example, laboratory medium) or natural (for example, crab
carapace) contains the proper nutrients and growth factors,
a single cell will multiply into many millions of offspring,
forming a microcolony. At first visible only under a microscope, the microcolony (Fig. 4.14) grows into a visible droplet called a colony (Fig. 4.13B). A pure culture of the species
or one strain of a species can be obtained by touching a single
colony with a sterile inoculating loop and inserting that loop
into fresh liquid medium.
It is important to note that the “one cell equals one colony” paradigm does not hold for all bacteria. Organisms such
as Streptococcus and Staphylococcus usually do not exist as single cells, but grow as chains or clusters of several cells. Thus, a
cluster of ten Staphylococcus cells will form only one colony on
an agar medium and so is called a colony-forming unit (CFU).
Another way to isolate pure colonies is the spread plate
technique. Starting from a liquid culture of bacteria, a
series of tenfold dilutions is made, and a small amount of
each dilution is placed directly on the surface of separate
agar plates (Fig. 4.15). The sample is spread over the surface of the plate with an alcohol-sterilized, bent glass rod.
The early dilutions, those containing the most bacteria,
will produce confluent growth that covers the entire agar
surface. Later dilutions, containing fewer and fewer organisms, yield individual colonies. As we will see later, spread
plates not only enable us to isolate pure cultures but also
can be used to enumerate the number of viable bacteria in
the original growth tube. A viable organism is one that successfully replicates to form a colony. Thus, each colony on
an agar plate represents one viable organism (or CFU)
present in the original liquid culture.

Complex versus Synthetic Media

We often culture bacteria in a type of medium, called complex medium (or “rich medium”) that is nutrient-rich but
has poorly defined components. Alternatively, we can select

Tenfold dilutions, plating, and viable counts.

A. A culture containing an unknown concentration of cells is serially
diluted. One milliliter (ml) of culture is added to 9.0 ml of diluent
broth and mixed, and then 1 ml of this 1/10 dilution is added to another 9.0 ml of diluent (10–2 dilution). These steps are repeated for
further dilution, each of which lowers the cell number tenfold. After
dilution, 0.1 ml of each dilution is spread onto an agar plate.
B. Plates prepared as in (A) are incubated at 37°C to yield colonies.
By multiplying the number of countable colonies (107 colonies on
the 10–5 plate) by 10, you get the number of cells in 1.0 ml of the
10–5 dilution. Multiplying that number by the reciprocal of the dilution factor, you can calculate the number of cells (colony-forming
units, or CFUs) per milliliter in the original broth tube (107 × 101 ×

a defined or synthetic medium in which all chemical components are known. Bacteria grow more slowly on defined
media because the organisms must synthesize more of
their own components. A minimal defined medium contains only those nutrients that are essential for growth of
a given microbe (Table 4.1). However, not every microbe
that can be cultured on a complex medium can be grown
on a defined medium. Recipes for complex media usually
contain several ingredients, such as yeast extract or beef
extract, whose exact composition is unknown. These additives include a rich variety of amino acids, peptides, nucleosides, vitamins, and some sugars. Some organisms are
particularly fastidious, requiring that components of blood

be added to a basic complex medium. With these additions,
the complex medium is called an enriched medium.
Complex media provide many of the chemical building
blocks that a cell would otherwise have to synthesize on
its own. For example, instead of making proteins that synthesize tryptophan, all the cell needs is a membrane transport system to harvest prefabricated tryptophan from the
medium. Likewise, fastidious organisms that require blood
in their media may reclaim the heme released from red
blood cells as their own, using it as an “enzyme prosthetic
group,” a group critical to enzyme function (for example,
the heme group in cytochromes). All of this saves the scavenging cell a tremendous amount of energy, and as a result,
bacteria tend to grow fastest in complex media.
The metabolism of a microbe growing in a complex
medium is hard to characterize. How would you know
whether E. coli possesses the ability to make tryptophan
if the bacterium grew only in complex media? Questions
like this can be asked of organisms able to grow in fully
defined synthetic media. In preparing a synthetic medium,
we start with water and then add various salts, carbon,
nitrogen, and energy sources in precise amounts. For selfreliant organisms like E. coli or Bacillus subtilis, that is all
that’s needed. Other organisms, such as Shigella species or
mutant strains of E. coli or B. subtilis, require additional
ingredients to satisfy requirements imposed by the absence
of specific metabolic pathways (growth factors are discussed shortly). However, newer molecular tools, such as
whole-genome sequencing, can reveal missing biosynthetic

pathways and help predict which nutrients are needed to
grow a particular species in a synthetic medium.
Thought Question

4.4 What would be the phenotype (growth characteristic) of
a cell that lacks the trp genes (genes required for the synthesis of tryptophan)? What would be the phenotype of a cell
missing the lac genes (genes whose products catabolize the
carbohydrate lactose)?

Selective and Differential Media

Microorganisms are remarkably diverse with respect to
their metabolic capabilities and resistance to certain toxic
agents. These differences are exploited in selective media,
which favor the growth of one organism over another,
and in differential media, which expose biochemical differences between two species that grow equally well. For
example, Gram-negative bacteria, with their outer membrane, are much more resistant than Gram-positive bacteria to detergents like bile salts and certain dyes, such as
crystal violet. A solid medium containing bile salts and
crystal violet is considered selective because it favors the
growth of Gram-negative over Gram-positive bacteria.
On the other hand, a differential medium is needed to distinguish between organisms that differ not in their ability to
grow, but in a particular biochemical function they possess.
For example, E. coli and Salmonella enterica, a major cause

nutrients not required by other species. Why, for example, should Streptococcus pyogenes make glutamic acid

oral cavity? Because it never needs to
make glutamic acid or alanine in its

the genes needed to synthesize these

would lactose-fermenting E. coli bacteria grow, and if so, what

Growth Factors, Unculturable Microbes,
and Obligate Intracellular Bacteria

Why do some bacterial species fail to grow in minimal
medium, or fail to grow at all in the laboratory? Such failures are a consequence of evolution and the organism’s
natural growth environment. Long-term growth in an
ecological niche that continually provides a compound an
organism would otherwise have to make can lead to loss

THE MICROBIAL CELL

SPECIAL TOPIC 4.1- - Antibiotic Hunters Culture the “Unculturable”
There is a quiet panic among infectious disease doctors,
who worry that we will soon run out of effective antibiotics
to treat deadly infections. Since antibiotics were introduced
over 70 years ago, bacterial pathogens have continually
evolved to resist their effects. Scientists, for their part, have
struggled to find new antibiotics to replace the old, ineffective ones. Chapter 27 will discuss this “arms race” in more
detail. The classic approach for finding new antibiotics is to
screen bacteria and fungi snatched from exotic environments
such as the Amazon for secreted antimicrobial compounds.
This method worked for decades, but over the past 20 years
it has yielded very few new antibiotics. A new way of thinking
was needed if we humans are to maintain dominance over
microbes.
Fewer than 1% of the microbes in the world whose DNA
we can detect can be cultured in the laboratory. This means
we have missed capturing the antibiotic potential of over
99% of living microbes. These “unculturable” organisms are
present in soil, water, and even the human body. Why do the
microbes grow there but not in the lab? They grow in their
natural environments because of interspecies cooperation.
In this environmental “buddy system,” one species provides a
growth factor to another species that cannot make its own.
Can we find a way to tame such uncooperative organisms and
screen them for new antibiotics?
Kim Lewis (Northeastern University, Boston) and colleagues have devised an elegant method to do just that.
To harvest previously unculturable soil microbes, samples
prepared from soil were diluted such that one bacterial cell
was delivered into each channel of a multichannel iChip
A.

(Fig. 1A). The channels contained agar plugs in which a
microbe could grow. Both sides of the device were covered
with semipermeable membranes and placed back into the
soil (Fig. 1B). Nutrients and growth factors made by organisms in the soil diffused into the chamber and allowed many
of the unculturable microbes to form colonies. Once a colony formed, the previously uncultured organism became
“domesticated,” able to grow on agar medium without further assistance. The mechanism of domestication is not yet
known.
The scientists made extracts from 10,000 iChip isolates
and tested each one for antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus, an important pathogen that can cause infections ranging from boils to sepsis. One extract was highly
effective. The Gram-negative organism that produced this
antibiotic was sequenced and named Eleftheria terrae
(Fig. 2). The structure of the antibiotic, teixobactin, is shown
in Figure 2B. It is a nonribosomal peptide synthesized by
enzymes instead of a ribosome (nonribosomal peptide synthesis is described in Special Topic 15.1).
The cellular target of teixobactin is peptidoglycan synthesis in Gram-positive bacteria (the peptide cannot penetrate
the Gram-negative outer membrane). The new antibiotic kills
bacteria by binding to the lipid carrier molecule, bactoprenol,
that ferries the peptidoglycan subunits N-acetylglucosamine
and N-acetylmuramic acid across the bacterial membrane
(described in Chapter 3). As a result, growing cells lyse
because they cannot make new cell wall. Chapter 27 describes
the details of peptidoglycan synthesis and the antibiotics that
target steps in this process.

BACTERIAL CULTURE, GROWTH, AND DEVELOPMENT

Teixobactin is unusual among antibiotics because
attempts to generate antibiotic resistance to it have failed.
Most antibiotics bind to bacterial proteins whose sequence
can easily change by mutation to become antibiotic resistant.
Teixobactin, however, binds to a highly conserved, nonprotein
component of the bacterial cell (bactoprenol). Altering bactoprenol to become teixobactin resistant would require the
bacterium to make new kinds of enzymes. Thus, the likelihood
that pathogens can develop resistance is low. This feature
makes this drug highly attractive as a potential therapeutic
agent. Whether or not teixobactin proves useful in treating
human infections, the new in situ culturing strategies used to
discover this new drug have reenergized the field of antibiotic

averaged. Knowing the dimensions of the grid and the height of the coverslip over the slide makes it possible to calculate the number of organisms in a milliliter.

However, we still do not know what those factors are. We
can grow Rickettsia using animal cell tissue culture or in
chicken eggs (the bacteria grow inside the endothelial cells
of blood vessels formed in fertilized eggs). But despite extensive efforts to grow them outside of a host cell (called axenic
growth), R. prowazekii has proved uncooperative.

Techniques for Counting Bacteria

Growing culturable bacteria in laboratory media is important
for studying their physiology and genetics, but knowing how
many bacteria are present in the medium is critical for interpreting results. You might also ask how we determine whether
a lake is contaminated with fecal bacteria or our peanut butter contains Salmonella. In addition to finding organisms in
these cases, we have to count how many there are to determine the extent of contamination. Counting or quantifying
microorganisms is surprisingly difficult because each of the
available techniques measures a different physical or biochemical aspect of growth. Thus, a cell density value (given as cells
per milliliter) derived from one technique will not necessarily
agree with the value obtained by a different method. Here are
some commonly used methods for counting microbes.

However, “seeing” an organism under the microscope
does not mean that the organism is alive, because living
and dead cells are indistinguishable by this basic approach.
Living cells may be distinguished from dead cells by fluorescence microscopy using fluorescent chemical dyes, as discussed in Chapter 2. For example, propidium iodide, a red
dye, intercalates between DNA bases but cannot freely penetrate the energized membranes of living cells. Thus, only
dead cells stain red under a fluorescence scope. Another
dye, Syto-9, enters both living and dead cells, staining them
both green. By combining Syto-9 with propidium iodide,
living and dead cells can be distinguished: Living cells stain
green, whereas dead cells appear orange or yellow because

can be counted directly using a microscope. A dilution of a
bacterial culture is placed on a special microscope slide called
a hemocytometer (or, more specifically for bacteria, a PetroffHausser counting chamber) (Fig. 4.19). Etched on the surface of the slide is a grid of precise dimensions, and placing a
coverslip over the grid forms a space of precise volume. The
number of organisms counted within that volume is used to
calculate the concentration of cells in the original culture.

gives a yellow appearance (Fig. 4.20).
Direct counting without microscopy can be achieved
using an electronic technique that not only counts but
also separates populations of bacterial cells according to
their distinguishing properties. The instrument is called a
fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) or flow cytometer. In the FACS technique, bacterial cells that synthesize
a fluorescent protein (such as cyan fluorescent protein; see
Section 2.4), or that have been labeled with a fluorescent
antibody or chemical, are passed single file through a small
orifice and then through a laser beam (Fig. 4.21A). Detectors measure light scatter in the forward direction (an indicator of particle size) and to the side (which indicates shape
or granularity). In addition, the laser activates the fluorophore in the fluorescent antibody, and a detector measures
fluorescence intensity.
Within a single culture, one subpopulation of cells may
fluoresce more than or less than another because of the
presence or absence of a targeted protein. Thus the FACS
technique enables us to use cell size and the level of fluorescence to identify and count different populations of cells.
For example, FACS analysis can determine the expression
of a gene in different subpopulations of cells in culture.
This can be done by placing the green fluorescent protein

gene (gfp) under the control of a specific bacterial gene
(making a gene fusion). Researchers can then use the flow
cytometer to count cells expressing that gene, and even
sort high-expressing cells from low-expressing cells. FACS
analysis makes it possible to determine which conditions
allow expression of the gene and whether all cells in the
population express that gene at the same time and to the
same extent (Fig. 4.21B).
Viable counts. Viable cells, as noted previously, are those

that can replicate and form colonies on a plate. To obtain a
viable cell count, dilutions of a liquid culture can be plated

138



PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

directly on an agar surface (as in Fig. 4.15) or added to
liquid agar cooled to about 42°C–45°C. The agar is subsequently poured into an empty petri plate (this is called the
pour plate technique), where the agar cools further and
solidifies. Because many bacteria resist short exposures to
that temperature, individual cells retain the ability to form
colonies on, and in, the pour plate. After colonies form,
they are counted, and the original cell number is calculated. For example, if 100 colonies are observed in a pour
plate made with 100 microliters (µl) of a 10 –3 dilution of
a culture, then there were 106 organisms per milliliter in
the original culture. Figure 4.15 illustrates these types of
calculations.
Although viable counts are widely used in research, this
method is problematic for measuring cell number. One
issue is that colony counting does not reflect cell size or
growth stage. Even more problematic, colony counts usually underestimate the number of living cells in a culture.
Cells damaged for one reason or another can remain metabolically active and alive but may be too compromised to
divide. Because these cells will not form colonies on an
agar plate, they will not be counted as living. Comparing a viable count with a direct count obtained from a
live/dead stain can expose the presence of these damaged cells. Another challenge is any organism that grows
in chains, such as Streptococcus, because each colony originates from a group of cells, not a single cell. Consequently,
counting colonies underestimates actual cell number. For
this reason, viable counts are reported as colony-forming
units (CFUs) rather than cells.
Biochemical assays. In contrast to methods that visualize individual cells, assays of cell biomass, protein
content, or metabolic rate measure the overall size of a
population of cells. The most straightforward but timeconsuming biochemical approach to monitoring population growth is to measure the dry weight of a culture.
Cells are collected by centrifugation, washed, dried in
an oven, and weighed. Because bacterial cells weigh
very little, a large volume of culture must be harvested
to obtain measurements, making this technique quite
insensitive. A more accurate alternative is to measure
increases in protein levels, which correlate with increases
in cell number. Protein levels are more easily measured
with relatively sensitive assays.
Optical density measures growth in real time. The phe-

nomenon of light scattering was introduced in Chapter 2.
Recall that the presence of bacteria in a tube of medium
can be detected by how cloudy the medium appears as the
cells scatter light. The decrease in intensity of a light beam
due to the scattering of light by a suspension of particles is
measured as optical density.

The optical density of light scattered by bacteria is a very
useful tool for estimating population size. The method is
quick and easy, but because light scattering is a complex
function of cell number and cell volume, optical density
provides only an approximate result that must be corrected using a standard curve. Typically, a standard curve is
obtained that plots viable counts for cultures versus optical
densities as measured by a spectrophotometer. Thereafter,
the optical density of a growing culture is measured, and
the standard curve is used to estimate cell number at any
given point during growth.
One problem with using optical density to estimate cell
numbers is that a cell’s volume can vary depending on its
growth stage, altering its light-scattering properties. Thus,
the cell number estimated by the standard curve may deviate from the true number. Another problem is that dead
cells also scatter light. Clearly, using optical density to estimate viable count can be misleading, especially when measuring populations in stationary phase.

To Summarize

















Microbes in nature usually exist in complex, multispecies communities, but for detailed studies they must be
grown separately in pure culture.
Bacteria can be cultured on solid or liquid media.
Defined or synthetic media contain only chemical
components that are known. Minimal defined media
contain only the defined nutrients essential for growth
of a given organism.
Complex, or rich, media contain many nutrients. Other
media exploit physiological differences between organisms and can be defined as selective, differential, or
both (for example, MacConkey medium).
Microbes can evolve to become unculturable or to
require specific growth factors depending on the
nutrient richness of their natural ecological niche.
Obligate intracellular bacteria lose metabolic pathways
provided by their hosts and develop requirements for
growth factors supplied by their hosts.
Microorganisms in culture may be counted directly
under a microscope, with or without staining, or by use
of a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS).
Microorganisms can be counted indirectly by viable
counts, measurement of dry weight, protein levels, or
optical density.
A viable bacterial organism is defined as being capable
of replicating.

How do microbes grow? What determines their rate of
growth? And when does growth restart in a nongrowing
population? In nature, the answers to these questions are
difficult to determine because most microbes exist in complex, mixed communities fixed to solid surfaces. Yet these
same multicellular communities can also send off planktonic cells, free-living organisms that grow and multiply
on their own. Growth of these planktonic cells is easier to
measure.
All species at one time or another exhibit rapid growth,
nongrowth, and many phases in between. For clarity, we
present here the principles of rapid growth, while bearing in
mind the diversity of growth situations in nature. We care
about growth because how rapidly a microbe grows influences how fast a pathogen causes disease, or how quickly
contaminated food spoils. Similarly, a bacterial species that
consumes oil is useful for cleaning up oil spills only if the
organism can grow rapidly.
Survival of any species ultimately depends on its ability to make more of its own kind. A typical bacterium
that can be cultured in the laboratory grows by increasing in length and mass, which facilitates expansion of
its nucleoid as its DNA replicates (see Section 3.4). As
DNA replication nears completion, the cell, in response
to complex genetic signals, begins to synthesize an equatorial septum that ultimately separates the two daughter
cells. In this overall process, called binary fission, one
parental cell splits into two equal daughter cells (Fig. 4.22A).
Although a majority of culturable bacteria divide symmetrically in two equal
A.
halves, some species divide asymmetrically. For example, the bacterium Caulobacter forms a stalked cell that remains
fixed to a solid surface but reproduces by
budding from one end to produce small,
unstalked motile cells. The marine
organism Hyphomicrobium also replicates asymmetrically by budding, releasing a smaller cell from a stalked parent
(Fig. 4.22B).
Eukaryotic microbes divide by a special form of cell fission involving mitosis,
the segregation of pairs of chromosomes
within the nucleus (see Section 20.2 and
eAppendix 2). Some eukaryotes also
undergo more complex life cycles involving budding and diverse morphological
FIGURE 4.22
forms.

The process of reproduction has implications for growth
not only of the individual, but also of populations. If we
assume that growth is unbounded, what happens to the
population? The unlimited growth of any population obeys
a simple law: The growth rate, or rate of increase in cell
numbers or biomass, is proportional to the population size
at a given time. Such a growth rate is called “exponential”
because it generates an exponential curve, a curve whose
slope increases continually.
How does binary fission of cells generate an exponential
curve? If each cell produces two cells per generation, then
the population size at any given time is proportional to 2n,
where the exponent n represents the number of generations (that is, cell divisions in which offspring replace parents) that have taken place between two time points. Thus,
cell number rises exponentially. Many microbes, however,
have replication cycles based on numbers other than 2.
For example, some cyanobacteria form cell aggregates that
divide by multiple fissions, releasing dozens of daughter
cells. The cyanobacterium enlarges without dividing, and
then suddenly divides many times without separating. The
cell mass breaks open to release hundreds of progeny cells.

PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

Generation Time

A variable not accounted for in bacterial growth curves is
the length of time from one generation to the next. In an
environment with unlimited resources, bacteria divide at a
constant interval called the generation time. The length of
that interval varies with respect to many parameters, including the bacterial species, type of medium, temperature, and
pH. The generation time for cells in culture is also known as
the doubling time, because the population of cells doubles
over one generation. For example, one cell of E. coli placed
into a complex medium will divide every 20 minutes. After
1 hour of growth (three generations), that one cell will have
become eight (1 to 2, 2 to 4, 4 to 8). Because cell number
(N) doubles with each division, the increase in cell number
over time is exponential, not linear. A linear increase would
occur if cell number rose by a fixed amount after every generation (for example, 1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4).
Why do we care about generation time? As noted already,
generation time is important when we’re trying to understand how rapidly a pathogen can cause disease symptoms.
In biotechnology, how fast a producing organism grows will
affect how quickly a commercially useful by-product can be
made. Let’s review how we calculate generation time.
Starting with any number of organisms (N0), the number
of organisms after n generations will be N0 × 2n. For example,
a single cell after three generations (n = 3) will produce
1 cell × 23 = 8 cells
The number of generations that an exponential culture undergoes in a given time period can be calculated if
the number of cells at the start of the period (N0) and the
number of cells at the end of the period (Nt) are known.

A.

Methods such as viable counts are used to make those
determinations. Thus,
Nt = N0 × 2n
can be expressed as
log 2 Nt = log 2 N0 + n log 2 2
= n + log 2 N0
Solving for n:
n = log2 Nt – log2 N0
= log2 (Nt /N0)
Once the number of generations (n) over a given time is
known, generation time (g) is calculated as
g = t/n [if 2 hours (120 min) yielded
6 generations, then g = 20 min]
The rate of exponential growth is expressed as the mean
growth rate constant (k), which is the number of generations (n) per unit time (usually generations per hour). This
is written as
k = n/t, where t is 1 hour; or k = 1/g
Thus, if the generation time is 20 minutes (0.33 hour) for
a given bacterial species in a given medium, the growth
rate constant k = 1/0.33 hour = 3 generations per hour. If
the generation time is 2 hours, the growth rate constant is
0.5 generation per hour.
In practice, exponential growth lasts for only a short
period when all nutrients are in full supply and the concentration of waste products has not become a limiting factor.
The growth rate constant can also be calculated from
the slope of log2 N over time, where N is a relative measure
of culture density, such as the optical density measured in
a spectrophotometer (Fig. 4.23A). The units of N do not

Thought Questions

4.9 Suppose you ingest 20 cells of Salmonella enterica in a
peanut butter cookie. They all survive the stomach and enter
the intestine. Suppose further that the sum total of subsequent bacterial replication and death (caused by the host)
produces an average generation time of 2 hours and you will
feel sick when there are 1,000,000 bacteria. How much time
will elapse before you feel sick?
4.10 Suppose one cell of the nitrogen fixer Sinorhizobium
meliloti colonizes a plant root. After 5 days (120 hours), there
are 10,000 bacteria fixing N2 within the plant cells. What is
the bacterial doubling time?

The mathematics of exponential growth is relatively
straightforward, but remember that microbes grow differently in pure culture (very rare in nature) than they do
in mixed communities, where neighboring cells produce
all kinds of substances that may feed or poison other
microbes. In mixed communities, the microbes may
grow planktonically (f loating in liquid), as in the open
ocean, or as a biofilm on solid matter suspended in that

replicate its chromosome and about 20 minutes to prepare
for another round of replication. Yet the organism enjoys
a 20-minute generation time growing at 37°C in complex
medium. How is this possible? Hint: How might the cell overlap
the two processes?

Stages of Growth in Batch Culture
Exponential growth never lasts indefinitely, because nutrient consumption and toxic by-products eventually slow the
growth rate until it halts altogether. The simplest way to
model the effects of changing conditions is to culture bacteria in liquid medium within a closed system, such as a
flask or test tube. This is called batch culture. In batch
culture, no fresh medium is added during incubation; thus,
nutrient concentrations decline and waste products accumulate during growth.
The changing conditions of a batch culture profoundly
affect bacterial physiology and growth, and they illustrate
the remarkable ability of bacteria to adapt to their environment. As medium conditions deteriorate, alterations
occur in membrane composition, cell size, and metabolic
pathways, all of which impact generation time. Microbes
possess intricate, self-preserving genetic and metabolic
mechanisms that slow growth before their cells lose viability. Because many bacteria replicate by binary fission,
plotting culture growth (as represented by the logarithm
of the cell number) versus incubation time makes it possible to see the effect of changing conditions on generation time and reveals the stages of growth shown in
Figure 4.23B—namely, lag phase, log phase, stationary
phase, and death phase.
Lag phase. Cells transferred from an old culture to
fresh growth media need time to detect their environment, express specific genes, and synthesize components
needed to grow rapidly. As a result, bacteria inoculated into fresh media typically experience a lag period,
or lag phase, during which cells do not divide. Several
factors influence lag phases. Cells taken from an aged
culture may be damaged and require time for repair.
Carbon, nitrogen, or energy sources different from those
originally used by the seed culture must be sensed, and

142



PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

the appropriate enzyme systems must be synthesized.
The length of the lag phase also varies with changes in
temperature, pH, and salt concentration, as well as nutrient richness. For example, transferring cells from one
complex medium to a fresh complex medium results in
a very short lag phase, whereas cells grown in a complex medium and then plunged into a minimal defi ned

amino acids, nucleotides, and other metabolites previously supplied by the complex medium.

macromolecular synthesis until DNA, R NA, ribosome,
and cell wall synthesis come into balance with the rest of
metabolism. In contrast, nutritional upshift means that
the cell will start making more energy than it needs at
its current growth rate, in which case cell metabolism
will again be out of balance with cell division. The same
fail-safe mechanisms used during downshift will, during upshift, kick macromolecular synthesis into a higher
gear, once again establishing balanced growth. Nutritional upshift causes cells to reenter log phase, but with a
shorter generation time.

their physiology to accommodate the new environment,
they begin to grow exponentially and enter what is called
exponential, or logarithmic (log), phase. Exponential
growth is balanced growth, in which all cell components
are synthesized at constant rates relative to each other—
the assumption behind the generation time calculation
given in the previous section. At this stage, represented
by the linear part of the growth curve, cells are growing and dividing at the maximum rate possible in the
medium and growth conditions provided (such as temperature, pH, and osmolarity). Cells are largest at this
stage of growth. If cell division were synchronized and
all cells divided at the same time, the growth curve during this period would appear as a series of steps with
cell numbers doubling instantly after every generation
time. But batch cultures are not synchronous. Every cell
has an equal generation time, but each cell divides at a
slightly different moment, making the cell number rise
smoothly.
Cells enjoying balanced, exponential growth
are temporarily thrown into metabolic chaos
(unbalanced growth) when their medium is abruptly
changed. Nutritional downshift (moving cells from a
good carbon source such as glucose to a poorer carbon
source such as succinate) or nutritional upshift (moving
cells to a better carbon source) casts cells into unbalanced growth. Downshifting to a carbon source with
a lower energy yield means not only that a different
set of enzymes must be made and employed to use the
carbon source, but also that the previous high rate of
macromolecular synthesis (such as ribosome synthesis)
used to support a fast generation time is now too rapid
relative to the lower energy yield. Failure to adjust will
lead to increased mistakes in RNA, protein, and DNA
synthesis, depletion of key energy stores, and ultimately
death.
How do microbes adjust to nutrient shifts? During
downshifts, energy levels (ATP) drop faster than macromolecular synthesis systems can stop making macromolecules. Molecular fail-safe systems quickly slow rates of

liliter) rises during log phase, the rate of doubling eventually slows, and a new set of growth phase–dependent genes
is expressed. At this point, some species can also begin
to detect the presence of others by sending and receiving
chemical signals in a process known as quorum sensing
(discussed in Chapter 10).
Stationary phase. Eventually, cell numbers stop rising,

owing to the lack of a key nutrient or the buildup of waste
products. At this point the growth curve levels off and the
culture is said to be in stationary phase (Fig. 4.23B). It
was thought that in stationary phase, the rate of cell division equaled the rate of cell death. That is, cells were either
dead or they were alive. That model has recently been
challenged by Nathalie Balaban and colleagues from the
Hebrew University of Jerusalem. They elegantly show that
the vast majority of cells thought to have died in stationary
phase are actually alive but growth-arrested—and can still
make protein (Fig. 4.24). The nature of growth arrest is
unclear but may involve the molecule guanosine tetraphosphate, which is associated with the stringent response (discussed in Chapter 10).
If they did not change their physiology, microbes
would be very vulnerable upon entering stationary
phase. Cells in stationary phase are not as metabolically
nimble as cells in exponential phase, so damage from
oxygen radicals and the toxic by-products of metabolism
readily kill them. As an avoidance strategy, some bacteria
differentiate into very resistant spores in response to
nutrient depletion (see Section 4.6), while other bacteria
undergo less dramatic but very effective molecular reprogramming. The microbial model organism E. coli, for
example, adjusts to stationary phase by decreasing its
size, thus minimizing the volume of its cytoplasm compared to the volume of its nucleoid. Fewer nutrients are
then required to sustain the smaller cell. New stress
resistance enzymes are also synthesized to handle oxygen radicals, protect DNA and proteins, and increase cell
wall strength through increased peptidoglycan crosslinking. As a result, E. coli cells in stationary phase

toxic chemicals present in the environment. Cells begin
to die, and the culture enters the death phase. Like the
growth rate, the death rate—the rate at which cells die—
is logarithmic. In death phase, the number of cells that
die in a given time period is proportional to the number
that existed at the beginning of the time period. Thus, the
death rate is a negative exponential function. The death
rate can be expressed as a half-life, the time over which a
population declines by half.
Determining microbial death rates is critical to the study
of food preservation and to the development of antibiotics
(further discussed in Chapters 5, 16, and 27). Although
death curves are basically logarithmic, exact death rates are
difficult to define because mutations arise that promote
survival, and some cells grow by cannibalizing others.
Consequently, the death phase is extremely prolonged. In
fact, a portion of the cells will often survive for months,
years, or even decades.
Note that the nice, smooth exponential growth
phase shown in Figure 4.23B does not always hold for
microbes growing in natural environments or in complex laboratory media containing multiple carbon and
energy sources. Some bacterial species produce odd-looking growth curves in complex media as the population
depletes one carbon source and must switch physiology to
use another. Even E. coli doesn’t really experience a uniform log-phase metabolism growing in complex medium;
instead, it smoothly transitions through a series of metabolic states.

Continuous Culture

In the classic growth curve that develops in closed systems,
the exponential phase spans only a few generations. In
open systems, however, where fresh medium is continuously added to a culture and an equal amount of culture
is constantly siphoned off, bacterial populations can be
maintained in exponential phase at a constant cell mass for
extended periods of time. In this type of growth pattern,
known as continuous culture, all cells in a population
achieve a steady state, which permits a detailed analysis of

microbial physiology at different growth rates. The chemostat is a continuous culture system in which the diluting medium contains a limiting amount of one essential
nutrient (Fig. 4.25). You could think of your gastrointestinal tract as a kind of crude chemostat. Nutrient enters
through your mouth and passes through your intestine,
where it feeds your microbiome, and your microbiome
exits in fecal waste. In both cases the numbers of microbes
in the chamber (or gut) remain relatively constant. The GI
tract is different from a chemostat, of course, in that nutrient intake and fecal exit are not continuous and water is
absorbed.
The complex relationships among dilution rate, cell
mass, and generation time in a chemostat are illustrated in
Figure 4.26. The curves in this figure represent a typical
experimental result. At very low dilution (flow) rates, the
nutrient is so limiting that cells will divide very slowly and
cell mass will remain low. Any increase in flow rate, however, will increase the availability of the limiting nutrient
such that cells grow faster and cell mass increases. The rate
of cell division and the cell mass are kept constant when the
flow rate is kept constant, because the amount of culture
(and cells) removed from the vessel exactly compensates
for the increased rate of cell division. Constant cell mass,
or density, can be maintained only over a certain range of
flow rates. At faster and faster flow rates, cells are eventually removed more quickly than they can be replenished by
division, so cell density (cell mass) decreases in the vessel—
a phenomenon called “washout.”

cultures are used in industry to optimize the production of antibiotics, beer, and other microbial products. In
research, continuous culture is used to examine what happens to metabolic flux (essentially the rate at which molecules move through metabolic pathways) before and after a
biochemical step is altered, and to conduct long-term studies of bacterial evolution.
One disadvantage of the continuous culture apparatus shown in Figure 4.25C is the large volume of
media required to maintain a 500-ml culture chamber
over a period of days or months. To solve this problem,
microfluidic principles have been used to miniaturize
the process onto a 5-cm computer-controlled lab chip.
One milliliter of culture moves along three chambers
that monitor oxygen, optical density, and pH. Culture
conditions are maintained or changed by a computer
that controls delivery of media and chemicals from onchip reservoirs. The heightened ability to control culture
parameters in small volumes can be used to characterize genetic switches, environmental shock responses,
directed evolution, co-metabolism, and the dynamics of
mixed-species cultures.

Continuous culture can be used to sustain a population
of bacteria at a specified growth rate and cell density.

Biofilms

Can bacteria collaborate? Bacteria are typically thought
of as unicellular, but many, if not most, bacteria in nature
form specialized, surface-attached, collaborative communities called biofilms. Indeed, within aquatic environments
bacteria are found mainly associated with surfaces—a fact
that underscores the importance of biofilms in nature. Soil
biofilms help filter groundwater through the soil, where
the bacteria break down organic waste. This process is especially important in wetlands, which provide an important
“ecosystem service” for human communities (discussed in
Chapter 22). Other biofilms play critical roles in microbial
pathogenesis and environmental degradation, which costs
billions of dollars each year in equipment damage, product
contamination, and medical infections. For example, pseudomonad or staphylococcal biofilms can damage ventilators used to assist respiration. Biofilms can also form inside

functions for different species. Confocal images of biofilms
are shown in Figure 4.28 (inset) and Figure 2.30. The formation of biofilms can be cued by different environmental
signals in different species. These signals include pH, iron
concentration, temperature, oxygen availability, and the
presence of certain amino acids. Nevertheless, a common
pattern emerges in the formation of many kinds of biofilms
(Fig. 4.28 ).
First, the specific environmental signal induces a genetic
program in planktonic cells. The planktonic cells then start
to attach to nearby inanimate surfaces by means of flagella,
pili, lipopolysaccharides, or other cell-surface appendages,
and they begin to coat that surface with an organic monolayer of polysaccharides or glycoproteins to which more
planktonic cells can attach. At this point, cells may move
along surfaces using a twitching motility that involves the
extension and retraction of a specific type of pilus. Ultimately, they stop moving and firmly attach to the surface.
As more and more cells bind to the surface, they can begin
to communicate with each other by sending and receiving
chemical signals in a process called quorum sensing. These
chemical signaling molecules are continually made and
secreted by individual cells. Once the population reaches
a certain number (analogous to an organizational “quorum”), the chemical signal achieves a specific concentration
that the cells can sense. This concentration triggers genetically regulated changes that cause cells to bind tenaciously
to the substrate and to each other. Quorum sensing serves

the biofilm in many ways. Among other functions, quorum
sensing triggers the increased resistance of biofilms to antibiotics and to phagocytosis by white blood cells—subjects
we explore in eTopic 4.4 and Special Topic 27.1.
Once established, the cells in a microcolony form a
thick extracellular matrix of polysaccharide polymers and
entrapped organic (DNA and proteins) and inorganic
materials (Fig. 4.28). These exopolysaccharides (EPSs),
such as alginate produced by P. aeruginosa and colanic acid
produced by E. coli, increase the antibiotic resistance of
residents within the biofilm. As the biofilm matures, the
amalgam of adherent bacteria and matrix takes on complex
3D shapes such as columns and streamers, forming channels through which nutrients flow. For many bacteria, sessile (nonmoving) cells in a biofilm chemically “talk” to each
other in order to build microcolonies and keep water channels open. Bacillus subtilis also spins out a fibril-like amyloid
protein called TasA, which tethers cells and strengthens the
biofilm. The effect of TasA on a floating biofilm formed on
liquid medium is evident in Figure 4.29.

sessile biofilm then sends out “scouts” called dispersal cells
to initiate new biofilms. For scouts to form, genes whose
products produce EPSs must be turned off, and for bacteria capable of motility, genes needed for flagella must be
activated.
Recall that biofilms are important for chronic infections,
so preventing or reversing their formation could prove therapeutic. Two intracellular signaling molecules critical to biofilm development and dispersal in many bacteria are the
unusual nucleotides cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate (cdiGMP) and guanosine tetra- and pentaphosphate
[(p)ppGpp]. High concentrations of either molecule promote biofilm formation, whereas low levels promote dispersal. Robert Hancock and colleagues from the University
of British Columbia may have found a way to undo a biofilm’s architecture by targeting one of these signal nucleotides. They recently discovered a synthetic peptide that binds
the signaling molecule (p)ppGpp and promotes its degradation in various pathogens. When used in vitro, this peptide
caused the death and dispersal of biofilm cells and may do
the same in an infection (Fig. 4.31).
Organisms adapted to life in extreme environments also
form biofilms. Archaea form biofilms in acid mine drainage
(pH 0), where they contribute to the recycling of sulfur, and

Cell Differentiation

Can bacteria change shape? Many bacteria faced with environmental stress undergo complex molecular reprogramming that includes changes in cell structure. Some species,
like E. coli, experience relatively simple changes in cell
structure, such as the formation of smaller cells or thicker
cell surfaces. However, select species, such as Caulobacter
crescentus, undergo elaborate cell differentiation processes.
Caulobacter cells convert from the swimming form to the
holdfast form before cell division (see Section 3.5). Each
cell cycle then produces one sessile cell attached to its substrate by a holdfast, while its sister cell swims off in search
of another habitat.
Eukaryotic microbes also have highly complex life cycles.
For example, Dictyostelium discoideum is a seemingly unremarkable ameba that grows as separate, independent cells.

other eukaryotic microbes that are human parasites (discussed in Chapter 20).

Endospores Are Bacteria in
Suspended Animation

Certain Gram-positive genera, including important pathogens such as Clostridium tetani (tetanus), Clostridium botulinum (botulism), and Bacillus anthracis (anthrax), have
the remarkable ability to develop dormant spores that
are heat and desiccation resistant. Spores are particularly
hearty because they do not grow and do not need nutrients

until they germinate. Resistance to heat and desiccation
(and its lethal toxin) makes B. anthracis spores a potential
bioweapon.
Most of what we know about bacterial sporulation
comes from the Gram-positive soil bacterium Bacillus subtilis. When growing in rich media, this microbe undergoes
normal vegetative growth and can replicate every 30–60
minutes. However, starvation initiates an elaborate 8-hour
genetic program that directs an asymmetrical cell division
process and ultimately yields a spore (see Section 10.3).
As shown in Figure 4.32 , sporulation can be divided
into seven discrete stages based primarily on cell morphology.
Stage 0 (not shown) represents the point at which the vegetative cell “decides” to use one of two potential polar division
sites to begin septum formation instead of the central division site used for vegetative growth. In stage I, the DNA is
replicated and stretched into a long axial filament that spans
the length of the cell. There are two chromosome copies at

this point. Ultimately, one of the polar division sites wins
out and forms a septum. In stage II, the septum divides
the cell into two unequal compartments: the smaller forespore, which will ultimately become the spore, and the larger
mother cell, from which the forespore is derived. Each compartment eventually contains one of the replicated chromosomes. (Most of the chromosome in the forespore has to be
pumped in after septum formation.)
In stage III of sporulation, the mother cell membrane
engulfs the forespore. Next, the mother cell chromosome is
destroyed (stage IV) and a thick peptidoglycan layer (cortex) is placed between the two membranes surrounding
the forespore protoplast (stage V). Layers of coat proteins
are then deposited on the outer membrane, also in stage
V. Stage VI completes the development of spore resistance
to heat and chemical insults. This last process includes the
synthesis of dipicolinic acid (which stabilizes and protects
spore DNA) and the uptake of calcium into the coat of the
spore. Finally, the mother cell, now called a sporangium,
releases the mature spore (stage VII).
Spores resist many environmental stresses that would
kill vegetative cells. Spores owe this resistance, in part, to
their desiccation (they have only 10%–30% of a vegetative

A.

Heterocyst

Cyanobacteria Differentiate into
Nitrogen-Fixing Heterocysts

Some autotrophic cyanobacteria, such as Anabaena, not only
carry out photosynthesis but also “fix” atmospheric nitrogen
to make ammonia. This is surprising because nitrogenase,
the enzyme required to fix nitrogen, is very sensitive
to oxygen present in air and produced as a by-product of photosynthesis. So one might expect that photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation would be two mutually
exclusive physiological activities. Anabaena solved this
dilemma by developing specialized cells, called heterocysts, that can fix nitrogen (Fig. 4.33). A tightly
regulated genetic program converts every tenth photosynthetic, vegetative cell to a heterocyst. As part of the
differentiation process, heterocysts make nitrogenase,
produce three additional cell walls, and form a specialized envelope that provides a barrier to atmospheric
20 µm
O2 and degrades the photosynthesis machinery that
produces O2. The heterocyst then supplies nitrogen
compounds to the adjacent vegetative cells, which, in
return, send carbon sugars to the heterocyst (see eTopic 2.1).
The precise spacing of heterocysts relies on the ratio of inhibitors relative to activators in different cells in the chain. Inhibitors predominate in vegetative cells, whereas cells fated to

cell’s water content). But, as discovered by Peter Setlow and
colleagues, spores are also packed with small acid-soluble
proteins (SASPs) that bind to and protect DNA. The SASP
coat protects the spore’s DNA from damage by ultraviolet
light and various toxic chemicals.
A fully mature spore can exist in soil for at least 50–100
years, and spores have been known to last thousands of years.
Once proper nutrient conditions arise, another genetic program, called germination, is triggered to wake the dormant
cell, dissolve the spore coat, and release a viable vegetative cell.
While sporulation is an effective survival strategy, bacteria that sporulate actually go out of their way not to sporulate—even to the point of cannibalism. During nutrient
limitation, these bacteria will secrete proteins that can kill
their siblings and then use the released nutrients to prevent
starvation and, thus, sporulation. When (and only when)
that strategy fails, they sporulate.

fluorescent protein (GFP) has been spliced. Only cells that have

cell fluoresce bright green.

Starvation Induces Differentiation
into Fruiting Bodies

Certain species of bacteria, in the microbial equivalent of
a barn raising, produce architectural marvels called fruiting bodies. The Gram-negative species Myxococcus xanthus uses a gliding motility (involving a type of pilus,

not a flagellum) to travel on surfaces as individuals or to
move together as a mob (Fig. 4.34). Starvation triggers a
developmental cycle in which 100,000 or more individuals aggregate, rising into a mound called a fruiting body.
Myxococci within the interior of the fruiting body differentiate into thick-walled, spherical spores that are released
into the surroundings. The random dispersal of spores
is an attempt to find new sources of nutrients. This differentiation process requires many cell-cell interactions
and a complex genetic program that we still do not fully
understand.

Some Bacteria Differentiate to
Form Filamentous Structures

The actinomycetes (see Chapter 18), such as Streptomyces,
are bacteria that form mycelia and sporangia analogous to
the filamentous structures of eukaryotic fungi (Fig. 4.35).
Several developmental programs tied to nutrient availability are at work in this process (Fig. 4.36). Under favorable
nutrient conditions, a germ tube emerges from a germinating spore, grows from its tip (tip extension), and forms

branches that grow along, and within, the surface of its food
source (Fig. 4.36, step 1). This type of growth produces
an intertwined network of long multinucleate filaments
(hyphae; singular, hypha) collectively called substrate
mycelia (singular, mycelium). After a few days, a signaling molecule made by the organisms accumulates to a level
that activates a new set of genes, including one encoding a
surfactant, that allow hyphae to grow into the atmosphere,
rising above the surface to form aerial mycelia (Fig. 4.36,
steps 2a and 2b). Compartments at the tips of these aerial
hyphae contain 20–30 copies of the genome. Aerial hyphae
stop growing as nutrients decline, triggering a developmental program that synthesizes antibiotics. Meanwhile, the
older ends of the filaments senesce, and their decomposing
cytoplasm attracts scavenger microbes—which are killed by
the antibiotics. The younger streptomycete cells then feast
on the dead scavengers.
The aerial hyphae ultimately produce spores (arthrospores) that are fundamentally different from bacterial endospores. This program lays down multiple septa
that subdivide the compartment into single-genome prespores (Fig. 4.36, step 3). The shape of the prespore then

organisms are of tremendous interest, both for their ability to make antibiotics and for their fascinating developmental programs.

To Summarize








Microbial development involves complex changes in
cell forms.
Endospore development by Bacillus and Clostridium
species is a multistage process that includes asymmetrical
cell division to make a forespore and a mother cell, forespore engulfment by the mother cell, deposition of coat
proteins around the forespore, and steps that increase
chemical and heat resistance of the endospore.
Heterocyst development enables cyanobacteria to
fix nitrogen anaerobically while maintaining oxygenic
photosynthesis.
Multicellular fruiting bodies in Myxococcus and mycelia in actinomycetes develop in response to starvation,
dispersing dormant cells to new environments.

Thought Question

4.16 How might Streptomyces and Actinomyces species avoid
“committing suicide” when they make their antibiotics?

Concluding Thoughts
Bacteria, as simple as they seem, perform incredibly complex
and highly orchestrated processes to achieve growth. They
coordinate the gathering of food with the synthesis of biomass and then adjust those processes as nutrients change in
the local environment, or when they are challenged by stress.
Most, if not all, bacteria also undergo elegant developmental
processes ranging from biofilms and swarming, to sporulation or heterocyst formation. As with metabolic adaptations,
developmental programs are launched in response to environmental pressures such as starvation, desiccation, changes
in temperature, and even crowding. The environmental
influence over these microbial processes impacts the composition and interspecies collaboration among water and soil
ecosystems, as well as within the microbial communities that
inhabit the human body. In Chapter 5 we build on these
concepts and explore the remarkable ways that microbes
respond to environmental stress and change.

Manipulating your neighbor. Can one bacterial species manipulate differentiation of another? Elizabeth Shank and student Matthew Powers explored this question by searching for
soil bacteria that could inhibit biofilm gene expression in Bacillus subtilis. One species, Pseudomonas protegens, uses 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) for that purpose. A DAPG-secreting
P. protegens colony (arrow) alters the wrinkle morphology of a
nearby B. subtilis colony (below). Subinhibitory concentrations
of DAPG also decreased Bacillus spore formation tenfold, proving that some microbiome species secrete signaling molecules
that manipulate the development of “niche-mates.” Microbiome
composition could be radically changed by such interactions.

icrobes have both the fastest and the slowest growth rates of any known organisms.
Some hot-springs bacteria can double in
as little as 10 minutes, whereas deep-sea-sediment
microbes may take as long as 100 years. What determines these differences in growth rate? Nutrition
is one factor, but niche-specific physical parameters such as temperature, pH, and osmolarity are
equally important. In Chapter 5 we explore the limits
of microbial growth and show how this knowledge
helps us control the microbial world.

Will the signal molecule DAPG affect sporulation of other

Whether DAPG affects other species depends on how it
impacts sporulation. DAPG probably acts early in the Spo0A
signaling pathway, increasing the chances that DAPG will
affect other bacteria with conserved Spo0A pathways. If
DAPG does affect other bacteria, it might be used to help
plants resist particular pathogens or, if DAPG prevents sporulation of the biopesticide Bacillus thuringiensis, it could
extend the efficacy of this biopesticide. Regardless, DAPG is
a useful chemical tool to probe how P. protegens and B. subtilis may chemically manipulate each other in nature.

PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

Microbes encounter numerous environmental stresses during their existence. Some are physical, some are chemical,
and some are imposed by their competitors, as illustrated
in the Current Research Highlight. Although a species’
physiology is geared to work within only a narrow range
of physical parameters, in nature the environment can
change quickly and dramatically. Many marine microbes,
for instance, move within seconds from deep-sea cold to
the searing heat of a thermal vent. How do these organisms
survive? Most species have stopgap measures called stress
responses that temporarily protect the organism from brief
forays into potentially lethal environments. But some organisms evolve to thrive, not just survive, in extreme environments. How do these so-called extremophiles grow under
conditions that would kill most living things? In addition
to environmental threats, microbes in nature wage wars
among themselves by secreting antimicrobial compounds.
Why doesn’t the toxin-producing microbe kill itself? Is it
somehow immune to its own toxin? Knowledge about how
microbes cope with their environments, and each other, is
exploited by humans to prevent the growth of bacteria in
foods, destroy disease-causing microbes, and develop new
microbe-based industries.
We begin this chapter by describing how physical and
chemical changes in the environment impact the growth of
different groups of microbes. We also explore how microorganisms adapt to different environments in ways both
transient (involving temporary expression of genes) and permanent (modifications of the gene pool). The permanent
genetic changes have led to biological diversity. Finally, we
examine the different ways humans try to limit the growth
of microorganisms to protect plants, animals, and ourselves.
As you proceed through this chapter, you will encounter two recurring themes: that different groups of microbes
live in vastly different environments, and that microbes can
respond in diverse ways when confronted by conditions
outside their niche, or comfort zone. Chapter 21 builds on
this information to discuss how communities of microbes
interact with their environment, and presents current
research methods that are used to study microbial ecology.

5.1

Environmental Limits
on Growth

What is normal? With our human frame of reference, we
tend to think that “normal” growth conditions are those
found at sea level with a temperature between 20°C and
40°C, a near-neutral pH, a salt concentration of 0.9%, and
ample nutrients. Any ecological niches outside this window
are labeled “extreme,” and the organisms inhabiting them
are called extremophiles. The term “extremophile” was first

used by NASA biochemist Robert MacElroy, who sought
evidence for kinds of life that might inhabit other planets.
Extremophiles are microbes (bacteria, archaea, and some
eukaryotes) that are able to grow in conditions extremely
different from those optimal for humans. For example,
one group of organisms can grow at temperatures above
the boiling point of water (100°C), while another group
requires a strongly acidic (pH 2) environment to grow.
According to our definition of what is “normal,” conditions
on Earth when life began were certainly extreme. The earliest microbes, then, likely grew in these extreme environments. Organisms that grow under conditions that seem
normal to humans likely evolved from an ancient extremophile that gradually adapted as the environment changed to
that of our present-day Earth.
A single environment can simultaneously encompass multiple extremes. In Yellowstone National Park, for
instance, an acid pool can be found next to an alkali pool,
both at extremely high temperatures. Thus, extremophiles
typically evolve to survive multiple extreme environments.
Extremophiles may provide insight into the workings of
extraterrestrial microbes we may one day encounter, since
outer space certainly qualifies as an extreme environment.
Our experiences with extremophiles should alert us to the
dangers of underestimating the precautions necessary in handling extraterrestrial samples. For example, we should not
assume that irradiation will sterilize samples from future planetary or interstellar missions. Such treatments do not even kill
Deinococcus radiodurans, an extremophile found on Earth.
How do we even begin to study organisms that grow in
boiling water or sulfuric acid solutions or organisms that
we cannot culture in the laboratory? Genome sequences
present new opportunities for investigating these questions.
Bioinformatic analysis, which uses the DNA sequence of a
gene to predict the function of its protein product, allows
us to study the biology of organisms that we cannot culture. Transcriptomic and proteomic techniques can examine all the gene and protein expression, respectively, that
take place in bacteria as they adjust to changing environments such as temperature or pH. These techniques are
discussed further in Chapters 7, 8, and 12.
We have already mentioned the fundamental physical conditions (temperature, pH, osmolarity) that define an environment and favor (select for) the growth of specific groups of
organisms. Within a given microbial community, each species
is further localized to a specific niche defined by a narrower
range of environmental factors (see the Current Research
Highlight). Species find their niche, in part, because every
protein and macromolecular structure within a cell is affected
by changes in environmental conditions. For example, a single enzyme works best under a unique set of temperature,
pH, and salt conditions because those conditions allow it to
fold into its optimum shape, or conformation. Deviations

from these optimal conditions cause the protein to fold a little differently and become less active. While not all enzymes
within a cell boast the same physical optima, these optima
must at least be similar and matched to the organism’s environment for the organism to function effectively.
As you might guess from the preceding discussion,
microbes are commonly classified by their environmental
niche. Table 5.1 summarizes these environmental classes.

To Summarize








Different species exhibit different optimal growth values of temperature, pH, and osmolarity.
Extremophiles inhabit fringe environments with conditions that do not support human life.
The environmental habitat (such as high salt or acidic
pH) inhabited by a particular species is defined by the tolerance of that organism’s proteins and other macromolecular structures to the physical conditions within that niche.
Global approaches used to study gene expression allow
us to view how organisms respond to changes in their
environment.

5.2

Temperature and Pressure

How do microbes react to hot and cold, or to high pressure? Let’s start with temperature. Unlike humans (and
mammals in general), microbes cannot control their

temperature; thus, bacterial cell temperature matches
that of the immediate environment. Because temperature affects the average rate of molecular motion,
changes in temperature impact every aspect of microbial
physiology, including membrane f luidity, nutrient transport, DNA stability, R NA stability, and enzyme structure and function. Every organism has an “optimum”
temperature at which it grows most quickly, as well as
minimum and maximum temperatures that define the
limits of growth.
Growth temperature limits are imposed, in part, by the
thousands of proteins in a cell, all of which must function
within the same temperature range. A species grows most
quickly at temperatures where all of the cell’s proteins work
most efficiently as a group to produce energy and synthesize cell components. Growth stops when rising temperatures cause critical enzymes or cell structures (such as the
cell membrane) to fail. At cold temperatures, growth ceases
because enzymatic processes become too sluggish and the
cell membrane becomes too rigid. The membrane needs to
remain fluid so that it can expand as cells grow larger and
so that proteins needed for solute transport can be inserted
into the membrane.
The different branches of life reflect narrowing tolerance to heat. Different archaeal species, for example, can
grow in extremely hot or extremely cold temperatures, and
some can grow in the middle range. Bacteria, for the most
part, tolerate temperatures between the archaeal extremes.
Eukaryotes are even less temperature tolerant than bacteria, with individual species capable of growth between
10°C and 65°C.

PART 1





THE MICROBIAL CELL

Growth Rate and Temperature

In general, microbes that grow at higher temperatures can
achieve higher rates of growth (Fig. 5.1A). Remarkably,
for any one species the relationship between growth temperature and the growth rate constant k (the number of
generations per hour; see Section 4.4) obeys the Arrhenius equation for simple chemical reactions (eTopic 5.1).
At higher temperatures,
growth rates fall because
enzymes denature.

The general result of the Arrhenius equation is that growth
rate roughly doubles for every 10°C rise in temperature
(Fig. 5.1A). This same relationship is observed for most
chemical reactions.
At the upper and lower limits of the growth range, however, the Arrhenius effect breaks down. Critical proteins
denature at high temperatures, whereas lower temperatures
decrease membrane fluidity and limit the conformational
mobility of enzymes, thereby lowering their activity. As a
result, growth stops at temperature extremes. The typical temperature growth range for most bacteria spans the
organism’s optimal growth temperature by 30°C–40°C,
but some organisms have a much narrower tolerance. Even
within a species, we can find mutants that are more sensitive to one extreme or the other (heat sensitive or cold
sensitive). These mutations often define key molecular
components of stress responses, such as the heat-shock proteins (discussed in Chapter 10).
Thermodynamic principles limit a cell’s growth to a narrow temperature range. For example, heat increases molecular movement within proteins. Too much or too little
movement will interfere with enzymatic reactions. A great
diversity exists among microbes because different groups
have evolved to grow within very different thermal ranges.
A species grows within a specific thermal range because
its proteins have evolved to tolerate that range. Outside
that range, proteins will denature or function too slowly
for growth. The upper limit for protists is about 50°C,
while some fungi can grow at temperatures as high as
60°C. Prokaryotes, however, have been found to grow at
temperatures ranging from below 0°C to above 100°C.
Temperatures over 100°C are usually found near thermal
vents deep in the ocean. Vent water temperature can rise
to 350°C, but the pressure is sufficiently high to keep the
water in a liquid state.

Microorganisms Are Classified
by Growth Temperature

Using range of growth temperature, microorganisms can
be classified as mesophiles, psychrophiles, or thermophiles
(Fig. 5.1B).
Mesophiles include the typical “lab rat” microbes,
such as Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Their growth
optima range between 20°C and 40°C, with a minimum
of 15°C and a maximum of 45°C. Because they are easy to

much of what we know about protein, membrane, and
DNA structure came from studying this group of organisms. However, detailed 3D views of protein structures are
frequently based on studies of two other classes of organisms whose optimum growth temperature ranges flank that

of the mesophiles—namely, psychrophiles (on the low-temperature side)
and thermophiles (on the high-temperature side). Because proteins from
thermophiles are more stable structures than proteins from mesophiles,
it’s easier to crystallize proteins from
extremophiles and determine their
structure by X-ray crystallography
(see Section 2.6).
Psychrophiles are microbes that grow at temperatures
as low as –10°C, but their optimum growth temperature is usually around 15°C. Psychrophiles are prominent
members of microbial communities beneath icebergs
in the Arctic and Antarctic (Fig. 5.2). In addition to
true psychrophiles, there are cold-resistant mesophiles
(psychrotolerant bacteria or psychrotrophs) that grow
between 0°C and 35°C. Both psychrophiles and psychrotrophs can be isolated from Antarctic lakes, beneath
several meters of ice (Fig. 5.2B). Entire microscopic ecosystems flourish there, capable of surviving –40°C all
winter, and then growing at near zero during the sunlit
summer. Polar microorganisms may be screened for novel
compounds with anticancer and antimicrobial potential.
Closer to home, in human environments, psychrotolerant
bacteria cause milk to spoil in the refrigerator. Even some
pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes (one cause of
food poisoning and septic abortions), can grow at refrigeration temperatures.
Why do these organisms grow so well in the cold?
One reason is that the proteins of psychrophiles are
more flexible than those of mesophiles and require less
energy (heat) to function. Of course, the downside to the
increased flexibility of psychrophilic proteins is that they
denature at lower temperatures than their mesophilic
counterparts. As a result, psychrophiles grow poorly, if
at all, when temperatures rise above 20°C. Another reason psychrophiles favor cold is that their membranes are
more fluid at low temperatures (because they contain
a high proportion of unsaturated fatty acids); at higher
temperatures their membranes are too flexible and fail
to maintain cell integrity. Finally, bacteria and archaea
that grow at 0°C in glaciers also contain antifreeze proteins and other cryoprotectants (such as trehalose) that
can depress the freezing point by 2°C. So, although these
organisms can grow in ice, they will not freeze. Interestingly, some psychrophilic and psychrotolerant bacteria actually stimulate ice formation in their surrounding
environment (eTopic 5.2).
Psychrophilic enzymes are of commercial interest
because their ability to carry out reactions at low temperature is useful in food processing and bioremediation.

in milk, and can remove cholesterol from various foods.
The production of foods at lower temperatures is beneficial too, because the lower processing temperatures minimize the growth of typical mesophiles that degrade and
spoil food. Genetically engineered psychrophilic organisms
can safely degrade toxic organic contaminants (for example,
petroleum) in the cold. Arctic environments are particularly sensitive to pollution because contaminants are slow
to degrade in the freezing temperatures. Consequently, the
ability to seed Arctic oil spills with psychrophilic organisms
armed with petroleum-degrading enzymes could more
rapidly restore contaminated environments.
Thermophiles (Fig. 5.3) are species adapted to
growth at high temperatures (typically 55°C and higher).
Hyperthermophiles, which grow at temperatures as high
as 121°C, are found near thermal vents that penetrate
Earth’s crust on the ocean floor and on land (for example, hot springs). The thermophile Thermus aquaticus was
the first source of a high-temperature DNA polymerase
used for PCR amplification of DNA. T. aquaticus was
discovered in a hot spring at Yellowstone National Park
by microbiologist Thomas Brock, a pioneer in the study
of thermophilic organisms. Its application to the polymerase chain reaction revolutionized molecular biology
(discussed in Chapter 7).
Extreme thermophiles often have specially adapted
membranes and protein sequences. The thermal limits
of these structures determine the specific high-temperature ranges in which various species can grow. Because
enzymes in thermophiles (thermozymes) do not unfold as
easily as mesophilic enzymes, they more easily hold their
shape at higher temperatures. Thermophilic enzymes
are stable, in part, because they contain relatively low
amounts of glycine, a small amino acid that contributes to an enzyme’s flexibility (glycines do not contain

side chains, so they cannot form stabilizing intramolecular bonds). In addition, the amino termini of proteins
in these organisms often are “tied down” by hydrogen
bonding to other parts of the protein, making them
harder to denature.
Like all microbes, thermophiles have chaperone proteins that help refold other proteins as they undergo thermal denaturation. Thermophile genomes are packed with
numerous DNA-binding proteins that stabilize DNA. In
addition, these organisms possess special enzymes that
tightly coil DNA in a way that makes it more thermostable
and less likely to denature (think of a coiled phone cord
that has twisted and bunched up on itself).
Special membranes also help give cells additional stability at high temperatures. Unlike the typical lipid bilayers
of mesophiles, the membranes of thermophiles manage to
“glue” together parts of the two hydrocarbon layers that
point toward each other, making them more stable. They
do this by incorporating more saturated linear lipids into
their membranes. Saturated lipids form straight hydrocarbon tails that align well with neighboring lipids and form
a highly organized structure that is stable to heat. The
membranes of mesophiles are composed mostly of unsaturated lipids that bend against each other and align poorly.
Consequently, the membranes of mesophiles are more fluid
at lower temperatures.
The membranes of hyperthermophilic archaea impart
an amazing level of heat resilience by being lipid monolayers, not bilayers (see Fig. 3.12 and eAppendix Fig. A2.3B).
Lipid bilayers peel apart under withering heat. Monolayers, built for extremophile living, do not. Monolayer membranes are heat stable because long hydrocarbon chains

by Tetsuo Yamamori and Takashi Yura in 1982, has
since been documented in all living organisms examined
thus far.

linkages to glycerol phosphate. More on thermophiles can
be found in Chapter 19.
How can we “see” the genome sequences of organisms
that will not grow at usual laboratory temperatures? And
could we use those sequences to invent biofuels? The DNA
of uncultured hyperthermophiles can be amplified by the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), a technique that multiplies a small sample of DNA (see Section 7.6). PCR can
amplify DNA directly from the natural environment in
which the organisms are found. Genomic comparison with
known models such as E. coli quickly reveals whether an
organism under study may possess specific metabolic pathways and regulatory responses. The ability to peek at the
genome of hyperthermophiles led Robert Kelly and colleagues at North Carolina State University to mix genes
and enzymes from different species (Fig. 5.4). Their lab
attempts to engineer a new organism able to convert abundantly available CO2 and H 2 directly into high-energy
liquid fuels.

The Heat-Shock Response

As insurance against extinction, most microorganisms
possess elegant genetic programs that remodel their
physiology into one that can temporarily survive inhospitable conditions. Rapid temperature changes experienced during growth activate batches of stress response
genes, resulting in the heat-shock response (discussed
in Chapter 10). The protein products of these heatactivated genes include chaperones that maintain protein

temperature change?

Adaptation to Pressure

Living creatures at Earth’s surface (sea level) are subjected to a pressure of 1 atmosphere (atm), which is equal
to 0.101 megapascal (MPa) or 14 pounds per square inch
(psi). At the bottom of the ocean, however—thousands
of meters deep—hydrostatic pressure averages a crushing
400 atm and can reach as high as 1,000 atm (101 MPa,
or 14,600 psi) in ocean trenches (Fig. 5.5). Organisms

its southwestern extremity, about 340 km (210 miles) southwest
of Guam, lies the deepest point on Earth. This point, referred to as
the Challenger Deep, plunges to a depth of 11,035 meters (nearly
7 miles). The pressure there (110 MPa) is over 1,000 times higher
than what we experience on land (0.1 MPa). B. The barophile

pressure, but die at
higher pressures.

Douglass Bartlett and colleagues at the Scripps Institution
of Oceanography gradually increased the pressure under
which E. coli was grown to 62 MPa. One E. coli mutant
evolved to successfully grow at this pressure. The evolved
strain developed a mutation in a key fatty acid synthesis
protein, which changed the ratio of its membrane fatty
acids. Further studies could uncover mutations in additional genes and improve our understanding of the evolutionary steps necessary for microbial growth under extreme
pressure.

adapted to grow at these overwhelmingly high pressures
are called barophiles or piezophiles. From the curves in
Figure 5.6, notice that barophiles actually require elevated pressure to grow, while barotolerant organisms grow
well in the range of 1–50 MPa, but their growth falls off
thereafter.
Many barophiles are also psychrophilic, because the
average temperature at the ocean’s floor is 2°C. However,
barophilic hyperthermophiles form the basis of thermal
vent communities that support symbiotic worms and giant
clams (see Chapter 21).
How bacteria survive pressures of 80–100 MPa
(11,600–14,500 psi) is still a mystery. It is known,
though, that increased hydrostatic pressure and cold temperatures reduce membrane fluidity. Because fluidity of
the cell membrane is critical to survival, the phospholipids of deep-sea bacteria commonly have high levels of
polyunsaturated fatty acids to increase membrane fluidity. It is thought that in addition to these membrane
changes, internal structures must be pressure adapted.
For example, ribosomes in the barosensitive organism
E. coli (maximum growth pressure 50 MPa) dissociate
at pressures above 60 MPa, so barophiles must contain
uniquely designed ribosome structures that can withstand even higher pressures.
Clues to the physiological changes needed for growth
at high pressure may come from E. coli adaptive-evolution studies. Over a period of 500 generations (126 days),







The Arrhenius equation applies to the growth of
microorganisms: within a specific growth temperature
range, the growth rate doubles for every 10°C rise in
temperature.
Membrane fluidity varies with the composition of
lipids in a membrane, which in turn dictates the temperature and pressure at which an organism can grow.
Mesophiles, psychrophiles, and thermophiles are
groups of organisms that grow at moderate, low, and
high temperatures, respectively.
The heat-shock response produces a series of protective
proteins in organisms exposed to temperatures near the
upper edge of their growth range.
Barophiles (piezophiles) can grow at pressures up to
1,000 atm but fail to grow at low pressures. Growth at
high pressure requires specially designed membranes and
protein structures.

Thought Question

5.3 What could be a relatively simple way to grow barophiles
in the laboratory?

5.3

Osmolarity

Water is critical to life, but environments differ in the
amount of water actually available to growing organisms. Microbes, for instance, can use only water that
is not bound at any given instant to ions or other solutes in solution. Water availability is measured as water
activity (a w), a quantity approximated by concentration.
Because interactions with solutes lower water activity, the
more solutes there are in a solution, the less water there
is available for microbes to use for growth. Water activity

CHAPTER 5



ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES AND CONTROL OF MICROBIAL GROWTH

is typically measured as the ratio of the
solution’s vapor pressure relative to that
of pure water. A solution is placed in a
sealed chamber, and the amount of water
vapor is determined at equilibrium. If
the air above the sample is 97% saturated
relative to the moisture present over pure
water, the relative humidity is 97% and
the water activity is 0.97. Most bacteria
growing on land or in freshwater habitats require water activity to be greater
than 0.91 (the water activity of seawater).
Fungi can tolerate water activity levels as
low as 0.86.

Osmotic Stress

Osmolarity is a measure of the number of solute molecules in a solution and is inversely related to aw. The more
particles there are in a solution, the greater the osmolarity
and the lower the water activity. Osmolarity is also important for a cell because of the cell’s semipermeable plasma
membrane. This membrane allows the osmolarity inside
the cell to be different from the osmolarity outside. The
principles of physical chemistry dictate that a solute present at different concentrations in two chambers separated
by a semipermeable membrane will tend to equilibrate. But
if the semipermeable membrane does not allow solutes to
move through the membrane, then osmolarity will equilibrate by water moving between the chambers. For a cell
in a hypertonic medium, where the external osmolarity
is higher than the internal, water will leave the cell in an
attempt to equalize osmolarity across the membrane. In
contrast, suspending a cell in a hypotonic medium (one of
lower osmolarity than the cell) will cause an influx of water
(see eAppendix 2).
Water does not move across cell membranes primarily by
simple diffusion. Instead, special membrane water channels formed by proteins called aquaporins enable water to
traverse the membrane much faster than by unmediated
diffusion. Rapid movement of water helps protect cells
against osmotic stress (Fig. 5.7). However, too much
water moving in or out of a cell is detrimental. Cells may
ultimately explode or implode, depending on the direction
the water moves. Even bacteria with a rigid cell wall suffer. They may not explode like a human cell, but the forces
placed on the cell wall are great.

Protection against Osmotic Stress

In addition to moving water, microbes have at least two
other mechanisms to minimize osmotic stress across

membranes. When stranded in a hypertonic medium
(higher osmolarity than the cell), bacteria try to protect
their internal water from leaving the cell by synthesizing
or importing compatible solutes that increase intracellular
osmolarity. Compatible solutes are small molecules that do
not disrupt normal cell metabolism even at high intracellular concentrations. Increasing intracellular levels of these
compounds (such as proline, glutamic acid, potassium, or
betaine) elevates cytoplasmic osmolarity without any detrimental effects, making it unnecessary for water to leave
the cell. In contrast, ions such as Na+ are not compatible
solutes and will disturb metabolism at high intracellular
concentrations.
Cells also contain pressure-sensitive (mechanosensitive)
channels that can be used to leak solutes out of the cell. It is
believed that these channels are activated by rising internal
pressures in cells immersed in a hypotonic medium (lower
osmolarity than the cell). When activated, the channels
allow solutes to escape, thereby lowering internal osmolarity and preventing too much water from entering the cell.
Outside a certain range of external osmolarity, these
housekeeping strategies become ineffective at controlling
internal osmolarity. To adapt, microbes launch a global
response in which cellular physiology is transformed to
tolerate brief encounters with potentially lethal salt (or
other solute) concentrations. Some changes are similar
to those provoked by heat shock, such as the increased
synthesis of chaperones that protect critical cell proteins
from denaturation. Other changes include alterations in
outer membrane pore composition (for Gram-negative
organisms).

Thought Question



5.4 How might the concept of water availability be used by
the food industry to control spoilage?


Halophiles Require High Salt

Some species of archaea and bacteria have evolved to
require high salt (NaCl) concentration in order to grow.
These microbes are called halophiles (Fig. 5.8). In striking contrast to most bacteria, which require salt concentrations from 0.05 to 1 M (0.2%–5% NaCl), the extremely
halophilic archaea can grow at an aw of 0.75 and actually
require NaCl at concentrations of 2–4 M (10%–20%) to
grow. For comparison, seawater is about 3.5% NaCl. All
cells, even halophiles, prefer to keep a relatively low intracellular Na+ concentration, because some solutes are moved
into the cell by symport with Na+. To achieve a low internal Na+ concentration, halophilic microbes use special ion
pumps to excrete sodium and replace it with other cations,
such as potassium, which is a compatible solute. In fact, the
proteins and cell components (for example, ribosomes) of
halophiles require remarkably high intracellular potassium
levels to maintain their structure. Halophilic archaea are
presented in Chapter 19.

To Summarize




Water activity (aw) is a measure of how much water in a
solution is available for a microbe to use.
Osmolarity is a measure of the number of solute molecules in a solution and is inversely related to aw.





Aquaporins are membrane channel proteins that allow
water to move quickly across membranes to equalize
internal and external pressures.
Compatible solutes are used to minimize pressure differences across the cell membrane.
Mechanosensitive channels can leak solutes out of the
cell when internal pressure rises.
Halophilic organisms require high salt concentrations
to grow.

5.4

Hydronium (pH) and
Hydroxide Ion Concentrations

As with salt and temperature, the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+)—actually, hydronium ions (H3O+)—also
has a direct effect on the cell’s macromolecular structures.
Extreme concentrations of either hydronium or hydroxide
ions (OH–) in a solution will limit growth. In other words,
too much acid or base is harmful to cells. Despite this sensitivity to pH extremes, living cells tolerate a greater range
in environmental concentration of H+ than of virtually any
other chemical substance. E. coli, for example, tolerates a
pH range from 2 to 10, a 10-million-fold difference (but
grows only between pH 4.5 and 9). For a brief review of
pH, refer to eAppendix 1.

of an organic acid (HA) can freely permeate cell membranes and dissociate intracellularly, releasing a proton
that then acidifies the internal pH (eTopic 5.3 describes
how). An example of organic acid stress involves the
lactic acid produced and secreted by lactobacilli during
the formation of yogurt. The buildup of lactic acid limits bacterial growth, leaving yogurt with plenty of food
value. The food industry has taken advantage of this
phenomenon by preemptively adding citric acid or sorbic acid to certain foods. This practice controls microbial
growth under pH conditions that do not destroy the f lavor or quality of the food. Figure 5.10 provides the pH
values of various everyday items. Food microbiology is
discussed further in Chapter 16.

protein shape and thus protein activity. Because H+ concentration, [H+], affects the protonation of these ionizable groups, changing the pH can alter the charges on
these groups, as well as protein structure and activity.
The result is that all enzyme activities exhibit optima,
minima, and maxima with regard to pH, much as they
do for temperature. As we saw with temperature, groups
of microbes have evolved to inhabit diverse niches, for
which pH values can range from 0 to 11.5 (Fig. 5.9).
However, species differences in optimum growth pH
are not dictated by the pH limits at which critical cell
proteins function.
Generally speaking, the majority of enzymes, regardless
of the pH at which their source organism thrives, tend to
operate best between pH 5 and 8.5 (which, if you think
about it, is still a 3,000-fold range in hydrogen ion concentration). Yet many microbes grow in even more acidic or
alkaline environments.
Unlike its temperature, the intracellular pH of a
microbe, as well as its osmolarity, is not necessarily the
same as that of its environment. Biological membranes
are relatively impermeable to protons—a fact that allows
the cell to maintain an internal pH compatible with protein function when growing in extremely acidic or alkaline
environments. When the difference between the intracellular and extracellular pH (ΔpH) is very high, protons can
leak through either directly or via proteins that thread the
membrane. Excessive influx or efflux of protons can cause
problems by altering internal pH.
Membrane-permeant organic acids, also called weak
acids (discussed in Chapter 3), can accelerate the leakage
of protons into a cell. Unlike H+, the uncharged form

Neutralophiles, Acidophiles, and
Alkaliphiles Grow in Different pH Ranges

Cells have evolved to live under different pH conditions not
by drastically changing the pH optima of their enzymes,
but by using novel pH homeostasis strategies that maintain
intracellular pH between pH 5 and pH 8, even when the
cell is immersed in pH environments well above or below
that range.

Three classes of organisms are differentiated by the pH
of their growth range: neutralophiles, acidophiles, and
alkaliphiles (see Fig. 5.9).
Neutralophiles, which generally grow between pH 5
and pH 8, include most human pathogens. Many neutralophiles, including E. coli and Salmonella enterica,
adjust their metabolism to maintain an internal pH
slightly above neutrality, which is where their enzymes
work best. They maintain this pH even in the presence
of moderately acidic or basic external environments
(Fig. 5.11). Other neutralophiles allow their internal
pH to f luctuate with external pH but usually maintain
a pH difference (ΔpH) of about 0.5 pH unit across the
membrane at the upper and lower limits of growth pH.
The ΔpH value is an important component of the transmembrane proton potential, a source of energy for the
cell (see Chapter 14).

Note:

The older term “neutrophile” used for this group of
organisms is similar to the descriptor for a specific type of white
blood cell (“neutrophil,” discussed in Chapter 23). To avoid confusion, the term “neutrophil” should be reserved for the white blood
cell and the term “neutralophile” used to designate microbes with
growth optima near neutral pH (pH 7).

Acidophiles are bacteria and archaea that live in acidic
environments. They are often lithotrophs (chemolithoautotrophs) that oxidize reduced metals and generate strong
acids, such as sulfuric acid. Consequently, they grow
between pH 0 and pH 5. Acidophiles generally maintain
an internal pH that is considerably more acidic than that of
neutralophiles but still less acidic than their growth environment (Fig. 5.12). The ability to grow at this pH is due
partly to altered membrane lipid profiles (high levels of tetraether lipids) that decrease proton permeability, as well as to
ill-defined proton extrusion mechanisms. Often, an organism that is an extremophile with respect to one environmental factor is an extremophile with respect to others as well.
Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, for example, is a thermophile and
an acidophile (Fig. 5.13). It uses sulfur as an energy source
and grows in acidic hot springs rich in sulfur.
Alkaliphiles occupy the opposite end of the pH spectrum, growing best at values ranging from pH 9 to pH 11.
They are commonly found in saline soda lakes, which have
high salt concentrations and pH values as high as pH 11.
Soda lakes, like Lake Magadi in Kenya’s Great Rift Valley
(Fig. 5.14A), are steeped in carbonates, which explains
their extraordinarily alkaline pH. An alkaliphilic organism
first identified in Lake Magadi is Halobacterium salinarum
(also known as Natronobacterium gregoryi), a halophilic
archaeon (Fig. 5.14B).
The cyanobacterium Spirulina is another alkaliphile
that grows in soda lakes. Its high concentration of carotene gives the organism a distinctive pink color (note the
color of the lake in Fig. 5.14A). Spirulina is also a major

are pink. After the birds ingest these organisms, digestive
processes release the carotene pigment to the circulation,
which then deposits it in the birds’ feathers, turning them
pink (Fig. 5.14C). Humans also consume Spirulina, as
a health food supplement, but they do not turn pink,

barrier that sequesters fragile cytoplasmic enzymes away
from harsh extracellular pH. Key structural features of the
cell wall, such as the presence of acidic polymers and an
excess of hexosamines in the peptidoglycan, appear to be
essential. The reason is unclear. At the membrane, some
alkaliphiles also possess a high level of diether lipids (more
stable than ester-linked phospholipids), which prevent protons from leaking out of the cell (see Section 3.2).
Because external protons are in such short supply at
alkaline pH, most alkaliphiles use a sodium motive force
in addition to a proton motive force to do much of the
work of the cell (see Section 14.2). They also rely heavily on

ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES AND CONTROL OF MICROBIAL GROWTH

pH Homeostasis and Acid Resistance

Neutralophiles, acidophiles, and alkaliphiles prefer
growth under neutral, low, and high pH conditions,
respectively.

When cells are placed in pH conditions below their optimum, protons can enter the cell and lower internal pH to
lethal levels. Microbes can prevent the unwanted influx of

role of K+ in osmoprotection. At the other extreme, under
extremely alkaline conditions, the cells can use the Na+/

transport system pumps protons (H+) out of the cell. The
resulting unequal distribution of H+ across the membrane
produces a transmembrane electrochemical gradient, a
kind of “biobattery” called the proton motive force (details
are discussed in Section 14.2). The overall process of electron transport and proton motive force generation is called
respiration if the electron donor is from an organic source
and lithotrophy if the source is inorganic (discussed in
Chapters 13 and 14).
Despite its importance for aerobic respiration, oxygen
and its breakdown products are dangerously reactive—a
serious problem for all cells. As a result, different species
have evolved to either tolerate or avoid oxygen altogether.
Table 5.2 gives examples of microbes that grow at different
levels of oxygen.

Aerobes versus Anaerobes

The relationships between microbes and oxygen are varied. Figure 5.18 shows a test tube with growth medium.
The top of the tube, closest to air, is oxygenated; the lower
part of the tube has much lower levels of oxygen. Some
microbes grow only at the top of the tube, while others
prefer to grow toward the bottom. Where in the tube a
microbe grows depends on that organism’s relationship
with oxygen. A strict aerobe is an organism that not only
exists in oxygen but also uses oxygen as a terminal electron
acceptor. The strict aerobe grows only with oxygen present and consumes oxygen during metabolism (aerobic respiration). An aerobe will grow only at the top of the tube
shown in Figure 5.18. In contrast, a strict anaerobe dies
in the least bit of oxygen (>5 μM dissolved O2).
Strict anaerobes do not use oxygen as an electron acceptor, but this is not why they die in air. Some anaerobes die

because they are vulnerable to reactive oxygen molecules
(also called reactive oxygen species, or ROS) produced
by their own metabolism. Other anaerobes have enzymes
that can protect them from ROS, but the dissolved oxygen raises the redox potential to a point that interferes with
the use of alternative (non-oxygen) electron acceptors that
the organism needs to make energy. Anaerobes will grow
at the bottom of the tube shown in Figure 5.18. As we
will discuss later, some bacteria previously considered strict
anaerobes are not so strict.

Anaerobes versus Facultative Microbes

Anaerobic microbes fall into several categories. Some anaerobes actually do respire by means of electron transport systems, but instead of using oxygen, they rely on alternative
terminal electron acceptors like nitrate (NO3 –) to conduct
anaerobic respiration and produce energy. Anaerobes of
another ilk do not possess cytochromes, cannot respire,
and so must rely on carbohydrate fermentation for energy
(that is, they conduct fermentative metabolism). In fermentation, ATP energy is produced through substratelevel phosphorylation in a process that does not involve
cytochromes. In either case, tolerance for ROS is low.
Facultative organisms are microbes that can live with or
without oxygen and grow throughout the tube shown in
Figure 5.18. Facultative anaerobes (such as E. coli) possess
enzymes that destroy toxic oxygen by-products, but they
have both fermentative and respiratory potential. Whether
a member of this group uses aerobic respiration, anaerobic
respiration, or fermentation depends on the availability of
oxygen and the amount of carbohydrate present. Aerotolerant anaerobes use only fermentation to provide energy but
contain superoxide dismutase and catalase (or peroxidase) to
protect them from ROS. These enzymes allow aerotolerant
anaerobes to grow in air (containing oxygen) while retaining
a fermentation-based (anaerobic) metabolism. Aerotolerant
anaerobes will grow throughout the tube in Figure 5.18.
Microorganisms that possess decreased levels of superoxide
dismutase and/or catalase will be microaerophilic, meaning they will grow only at low oxygen concentrations.

aerotolerant. These “anaerobes” tolerate oxygen because
they possess low levels of ROS-protective enzymes and
can even use very low levels of oxygen as terminal electron
acceptors. B. fragilis, part of the normal gastrointestinal
microbiota, may even help lower O2 levels in the intestine.
The fundamental composition of all cells reflects their
evolutionary origin as anaerobes. Lipids, nucleic acids, and
amino acids are all highly reduced—which is why our bodies are combustible. We never would have evolved that way
if molecular oxygen had been present from the beginning.
Even today, the majority of all microbes are anaerobic,
growing buried in the soil, within our anaerobic digestive
tract, or within biofilms on our teeth.

these organisms or their secreted toxins are even potential weapons of terror (for example, Clostridium botulinum). Because of their ability to wreak havoc on humans,
culturing these microorganisms was an early goal of
microbiologists. Despite the difficulties involved, conditions were eventually contrived in which all, or at least
most, of the oxygen could be removed from a culture
environment.
Three oxygen-removing techniques are used today.
Special reducing agents (for example, thioglycolate) or
enzyme systems (such as Oxyrase) that eliminate dissolved
oxygen can be added to ordinary liquid media. Anaerobes
can then grow beneath the culture surface. A second,
very popular way to culture anaerobes, especially on agar
plates, is to use an anaerobe jar (Fig. 5.20A). Agar plates
streaked with the organism are placed into a sealed jar
with a foil packet that releases H 2 and CO2 gases. A palladium packet hanging from the jar lid catalyzes a reaction
between the H 2 and O2 in the jar to form H 2O, and effectively removes O2 from the chamber. The CO2 released
is required by some reactions to produce key metabolic
intermediates. Some microaerophilic microbes, like the
pathogens Helicobacter pylori (the major cause of stomach
ulcers) and Campylobacter jejuni (a major cause of diarrhea), require low levels of O2 but elevated amounts of
CO2. These conditions are obtained by using similar gasgenerating packets.
For strict anaerobes exquisitely sensitive to oxygen,
even more heroic efforts are required to establish an
oxygen-free environment. A special anaerobic glove box
must be used in which the atmosphere is removed by vacuum and replaced with a precise mixture of N2 and CO2
gases (Fig. 5.20B).

Thought Question

5.8 What evidence led people to think about looking for
anaerobes? Hint: Look up “Spallanzani,” “Pasteur,” and
“spontaneous generation” on the Internet.

To Summarize










Oxygen is a benefit to aerobes, organisms that can use
it as a terminal electron acceptor to extract energy from
nutrients.
Oxygen is toxic to all cells—for example, anaerobes—
that do not have enzymes capable of efficiently destroying reactive oxygen species (ROS).
Anaerobic metabolism can be either fermentative or
respiratory. Anaerobic respiration requires the organism
to possess cytochromes that can transfer electrons to terminal electron acceptors other than oxygen. Fermentative
metabolism uses substrate-level phosphorylation to generate ATP in a process that does not involve cytochromes.
Aerotolerant anaerobes grow in either the presence
or the absence of oxygen, but use fermentation as their
primary, if not only, means of gathering energy. These
microbes also have enzymes that destroy ROS, allowing
them to grow in oxygen.
Facultative anaerobes grow with or without oxygen and
have enzymes that destroy ROS. In addition, they possess both the ability for fermentative metabolism and respiration (anaerobic and aerobic). They can use oxygen as
a terminal electron acceptor.

ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES AND CONTROL OF MICROBIAL GROWTH

Nutrient Deprivation
and Starvation

It is intuitively obvious that limiting the availability of a
carbon source or other essential nutrient will limit growth.
Less obvious are the dramatic molecular events that cascade through a starving cell. Optimizing growth rate when
nutrient levels are suboptimal is an important aim of freeliving bacteria, given that intestinal, soil, and marine environments rarely offer excess nutrients.

Starvation Activates Survival Genes

Numerous gene systems are affected when nutrients
decline (see Sections 10.2 and 10.3). Growth rate slows,
and daughter cells become smaller and begin to experience what is called a “starvation” response, in which the
microbe senses a dire situation developing but still strives
to find new nourishment. The resulting metabolic slowdown generates increased concentrations of critically
important small signaling molecules, such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP or cAMP) and guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), which globally transform
gene expression. The highly soluble nature of these small
molecules means they can quickly diffuse throughout the
cell, promoting a fast response. During this metabolic
retooling, transport systems for potential nutrients are
produced even if the matching substrates are unavailable.
Cells begin to make and store glycogen, presumably as
an internal emergency store in case no other nutrient is
found. Some organisms growing on nutrient-limited agar
plates can even form colonies with intricate geometrical
shapes that help the population cope, in some unknown
way, with nutrient stress (Fig. 5.21).
As nutrient conditions worsen, the organism prepares for
famine by activating many different stress survival genes.

175

The products of these genes afford protection against
stressors such as reactive oxygen radicals or temperature
and pH extremes. No cell can predict the precise stresses it
might encounter while incapacitated, so it is advantageous
to be prepared for as many as possible. As described in
Section 4.6, some species undergo elaborate developmental
processes that ultimately produce dormant spores.
When severely stressed by starvation, some members of
a bacterial population appear to sacrifice themselves to save
others by undergoing what is termed programmed cell
death. The dying cells release nutrients that neighboring
cells use to survive. One of the mechanisms for programmed
cell death involves so-called toxin-antitoxin systems. For
each TA pair, the toxin protein will stop growth or kill the
cell, but the antitoxin (sometimes a protein, sometimes a
small RNA molecule) can inactivate the toxin.
An important toxin-antitoxin system in E. coli is the
MazE (antitoxin)–MazF (toxin) module (Fig. 5.22A).
Because toxin and antitoxin are simultaneously made,
healthy cells live. However, MazE is unstable (degraded by
the ClpAP protease) and must continually be replenished
by synthesis to inactivate MazF. If cells are starved, they
stop making MazE and F. MazE antitoxin is degraded,
leaving the more stable MazF free to cleave many cellular mRNA molecules. As a result, the cell first enters stasis, from which it can recover if more MazE is made. But if
MazE is not forthcoming, the cell dies and releases nutrients. The dying cell will also signal nearby cells to undergo
programmed cell death. A peptide cleaved from glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase is released from the dying cell
and enters nearby cells. The peptide binds to MazE and
prevents it from neutralizing MazF. The MazF toxin, now
active, will eventually kill the bystander cell. Combined,
enough nutrients are released to rescue a subset of the population. Nancy Woychik at Rutgers University studies how
toxin-antitoxin systems contribute to latency of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Fig. 5.22B).

Microbes Encounter Multiple
Stresses in Real Life

Bacterial stress responses have traditionally been studied
by exposing organisms to individual stresses. Escherichia
coli, for example, synthesizes a specific set of proteins when
exposed to high temperature and a different set of proteins
when exposed to high salt. Some proteins, however, may
be highly expressed under both conditions, but each stress
response also includes proteins unique to that stress.
In the world outside of the laboratory, by contrast,
environmental situations can be quite complex, involving multiple, not just single, stresses. An organism could
simultaneously undergo carbon starvation in a high-salt,
low-pH environment. A classic study by Kelly Abshire and
Fred Neidhardt examined this situation using the pathogen Salmonella enterica, a cause of diarrhea. S. enterica

A. The E. coli MazEF toxin-antitoxin system
is thought to play an important role in
bacterial survival during stress. MazE antitoxin is continually degraded by ClpAP and
must be replenished to neutralize MazF
toxin. Other toxin-antitoxin systems are
found in other bacterial species. Stresses
such as starvation, oxidative stress, or
antibiotics can activate this system.

invades human macrophage cells and survives in phagocytic vacuoles, where numerous stresses, such as low pH,
oxidative stress, and nutrient limitations, are simultaneously imposed on the bacteria. Comparing the proteins
synthesized by Salmonella growing in this compartment
with the proteins synthesized under single stresses in
the laboratory revealed an unexpected response pattern.
Although many stress-related proteins were induced in
the intracellular environment, no one set of stress-induced
proteins was induced in its entirety. Furthermore, several
bacterial proteins were induced by growth only within the
macrophage phagolysosome, suggesting the presence of
unknown intracellular stresses. Thus, caution is advised
when trying to predict cell responses to real-world situations based solely on controlled laboratory studies that
alter only single parameters.

CHAPTER 5



ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES AND CONTROL OF MICROBIAL GROWTH

Humans Influence Microbial Ecosystems

Human activities have striking impacts on microbial
ecosystems. One example comes from the mining of coal
and minerals from the earth or, rather, from what happens
after those mines are abandoned. Mining usually takes
place below the water table, so water is continually pumped
out to prevent flooding. Once a mine is abandoned, pumping stops and the mine floods. Acid mine drainage develops from the oxidation of pyrite (FeS2) unearthed by the
mining operations. The exposed pyrite oxidizes in air to
form sulfuric acid that, along with soluble Fe2+, can drain
from the mine and destroy natural ecosystems. Acidophiles
such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans are key contributors
to pyrite oxidation.
Mining is not the only human activity affecting Earth’s
microbiota. Another example is eutrophication. Natural ecosystems are typically low in nutrients (oligotrophic;
eTopic 5.6) but teem with diversity, so that numerous species compete for the same limiting nutrients. Maximum
diversity in a given ecosystem is maintained, in part, by
the different nutrient-gathering profiles of competing
microbes. However, the sudden infusion of large quantities
of a formerly limiting nutrient, a process called eutrophication, can lead to a “bloom” of microbes, typically autotrophic cyanobacteria (formerly called blue-green algae; see
Section 18.2). One species initially held in check by the
limiting nutrient now exhibits unrestricted growth, consuming other nutrients as it grows to a degree that threatens the existence of competing species.
Humans cause eutrophication in several ways. Fertilizer
runoff from agricultural fields, urban lawns, and golf courses
is one source. Untreated or partially treated domestic sewage is another. Spilling large amounts of phosphates or
nitrogen into lakes—Lake Erie, for example (Fig. 5.23)—
powerfully stimulates cyanobacterial growth. The resulting bacterial “blooms” (wrongly called “algal blooms”)



177

can deplete the oxygen in the water and lead to fish kills.
Native fish species can disappear, to be replaced by species
more tolerant of the new conditions. The concept of limiting nutrients in ecosystems is covered further in Chapter 21.
Climate change caused by human activity is another
process that will gradually alter microbial ecosystems. Put
simply, the spewing of heat-trapping CO2 into the atmosphere by burning hydrocarbons is speeding Earth’s warming. Since 1980, the average atmospheric temperature has
risen 0.6°C (1.2°F). Konstantinos Konstantinidis from the
Georgia Institute of Technology, and Jizhong Zhou from
the University of Oklahoma recently completed a ten-year
study examining how a mere 2°C difference in soil temperature can affect a community of soil microorganisms. Using
an infrared light, the team warmed a patch of Oklahoma
prairie soil 2°C above that of an adjacent control patch of
soil. They then used DNA-based techniques to catalog the
microbial genera present (Fig. 5.24). Some taxonomic
groups of organisms became more dominant (Actinobacteria), while others became less abundant (Proteobacteria and
Acidobacteria). What future effects these kinds of changes
will have on the carbon and nitrogen cycles, as well as on
farm productivity, remain to be seen.

PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

Thought Question



Disinfection is the killing, or removal, of diseaseproducing organisms from inanimate surfaces; it does
not necessarily result in sterilization. Pathogens are
killed, but other microbes may survive.



Antisepsis is similar to disinfection, but it applies to
removing pathogens from the surface of living tissues,
like the skin. Antiseptic chemicals are usually not as toxic
as disinfectants, which frequently damage living tissues.



Sanitation is closely related to disinfection. It consists of
reducing the microbial population to safe levels and usually involves both cleaning and disinfecting an object.

5.9 Given a mixture of two microbes—one better at utiliz-

ing phosphate (microbe A) and the other better at utilizing
nitrogen (microbe B)—what would happen if excess nitrogen
was added to the mixed culture? What about both excess
phosphate and excess nitrogen?

To Summarize






Starvation is a stress that can elicit a molecular response
in many microbes. Enzymes are produced to increase
the efficiency of nutrient gathering and to protect cell
macromolecules from damage.
The starvation response is usually triggered by the
accumulation of small signaling molecules, such as cyclic
AMP or guanosine tetraphosphate.
Human activities can cause eutrophication, which
damages delicately balanced ecosystems by introducing
nutrients that can allow one member of the ecosystem to
flourish at the expense of other species.

5.7

Physical, Chemical,
and Biological Control
of Microbes

We have seen how microbes live; now, how do they die? A
primary goal of our health care system is to control or kill
microbes that can potentially harm us. Within the recent
past, infectious disease was an imminent and constant
threat to most of the human population. The average family in the United States prior to 1900 had four or five children, but parents could expect half of them to succumb to
deadly infectious diseases. What today would be a simple
infected cut, in years past held a serious risk of death, and
a trip to the surgeon was tantamount to playing Russian
roulette with an unsterilized scalpel. Improvements in sanitation procedures and antiseptics and the advent of antibiotics have, to a large degree, curtailed the incidence and
lethal effects of many infectious diseases. Success in this
endeavor has played a major role in extending life expectancy and in contributing to the population explosion.
A variety of terms are used to describe antimicrobial control measures. The terms convey subtle, yet vitally important, differences in control strategies and outcomes.


Sterilization is the process by which all living cells,
spores, and viruses are destroyed on an object.

Antimicrobials can also be classified on the basis of the
specific groups of microbes destroyed, leading to the terms
“microbicide,” “bactericide,” “algicide,” “fungicide,” and
“virucide.” These agents can be classified further as either
“-static” (inhibiting growth) or “-cidal” (killing cells). For
example, antibacterial agents may be bacteriostatic or bactericidal. Chemical substances are germicidal if they kill
pathogens (and many nonpathogens), but germicidal agents
do not necessarily kill spores.
Although these descriptions emphasize the killing of
pathogens, it is important to note that antimicrobial agents
can also kill or prevent the growth of nonpathogens. Many
public health standards are based on total numbers of
microorganisms on an object, regardless of pathogenic
potential. For example, to gain public health certification,
the restaurants we frequent must demonstrate low numbers of bacteria (pathogenic or not) in their food preparation areas.

Thought Question

5.10 Bacteriostatic antibiotics do not kill bacteria; they only
inhibit their growth. Why are they nevertheless effective at
treating bacterial infections? Hint: Is the human body a quiet
bystander during an infection?

Cells Treated with Antimicrobials
Die at a Logarithmic Rate

Exposing microbes to lethal chemicals or conditions does
not instantly kill all microorganisms. Microbes die according to a negative exponential curve, where cell numbers are
reduced in equal fractions at constant intervals. The efficacy
of a given lethal agent or condition is measured as decimal
reduction time (D-value), which is the length of time it
takes that agent (or condition) to kill 90% of the population
(a drop of one log unit, or a drop to 10% of the original
value). Figure 5.25 illustrates the exponential death profile of a bacterial culture heated to 100°C. The D-value is

a little over 1 minute. The food industry uses D-value and
several other parameters to evaluate the efficiency of killing
(see Section 16.5).

Thought Question

5.11 If a disinfectant is added to a culture containing

1 × 106 CFUs per milliliter and the D-value of the disinfectant
is 2 minutes, how many viable cells are left after 4 minutes of
exposure?

Several factors influence the ability of an antimicrobial
agent to kill microbes. These include the initial population size (the larger the population, the longer it takes to
reduce it to a specific number), the population composition (are spores involved?), the concentration of the antimicrobial agent, and the duration of exposure. Although
the effect of concentration seems intuitively obvious,
an increase in concentration is matched by an increase
in death rate only over a narrow concentration range.
Increases above a certain level might not accelerate killing at all. For example, 70% ethanol is actually better than
pure ethanol at killing organisms, because some water is
needed to help ethanol penetrate cells. The ethanol then
dehydrates cell proteins.
Why, then, is death an exponential function? Why don’t
all cells in a population die instantly when treated with
lethal heat or chemicals? The reason is based, in part, on
the random probability that an agent will cause a lethal
“hit” in a given cell. Cells contain thousands of different



179

proteins and thousands of molecules of each one. Not all
proteins and not all genes in a chromosome are damaged
by an agent at the same time. Damage accumulates. Only
when enough molecules of an essential protein or a gene
encoding that protein are damaged will the cell die. Cells
that die first are those that accumulate lethal hits early.
Members of the population that die later have, by random
chance, absorbed more hits on nonessential proteins or
genes, sparing the essential ones.
Why, if 90% of a population is killed in 1 minute, isn’t
the remaining 10% killed in the next minute? It seems
logical that all should have perished. Yet after the second
minute, 1% of the original population remains alive. This
phenomenon can also be explained by the random-hit concept. Although fewer viable cells remain after 1 minute,
each has the same random chance of having a lethal hit as
when the treatment began. Thus, death rate is an exponential function, much like radioactive decay is an exponential
function.
A final consideration is the overall fitness of individual
cells. It is a mistake to assume that all cells in a population
are identical. At any given time, for instance, one cell may
express a protein that another cell has just stopped expressing (for example, superoxide dismutase). In that instant,
the first cell might contain a bit more of that protein. If
the protein is essential or confers a level of stress protection
(such as against superoxide), the cell with more of that protein can absorb more punishment before it dies. The presence of lucky individuals expressing the right repertoire of
proteins might also explain why death curves commonly
level off after a certain point.

Physical Agents That Kill Microbes

Physical agents are often used to kill microbes or control
their growth. Commonly used physical control measures
include temperature extremes, pressure (usually combined
with temperature), filtration, and irradiation.
High temperature and pressure. Even though microbes

were discovered less than 400 years ago, thermal treatment of food products to render them safe has been practiced for over 5,000 years. Moist heat is a much more
effective killer than dry heat, thanks to the ability of water
to penetrate cells. Many bacteria, for instance, easily withstand 100°C dry heat but not 100°C boiling water. We
humans are not so different, fi nding it easier to endure a
temperature of 32°C (90°F) in dry Arizona than in humid
Louisiana.
While boiling water (100°C) can kill most vegetative
(actively growing) organisms, spores are built to withstand
this abuse, and thermophiles prefer it. Killing spores and

thermophiles usually requires combining high pressure
and temperature. At high pressure, the boiling point of
water rises to a temperature rarely experienced by microbes
living at sea level. Even endospores quickly die under these
conditions. This combination of pressure and temperature is the principle behind sterilization using the steam
autoclave (Fig. 5.26). Standard conditions for steam sterilization are 121°C (250°F) at 15 psi for 20 minutes—a
set of conditions that experience has taught us will kill all
spores (except those of some thermophiles, which do not
affect food or human health). These are also the conditions produced in pressure cookers used for home canning
of vegetables.
Failure to adhere to these heat and pressure parameters
can have deadly consequences, even in your own home. For
instance, Clostridium botulinum is a spore-forming soil
microbe that commonly contaminates fruits and vegetables used in home canning. The improper use of a pressure
cooker while canning these goods will allow spores of this
pathogen to survive. Once the can or jar is cool, the spores
will germinate and begin producing their deadly toxin. All
of this happens while the canned goods sit on a shelf waiting to be opened and consumed. Once ingested, the toxin
makes its way to the nervous system and paralyzes the victim. Several incidents of this disease, called botulism, occur

save products of the French wine industry from devastating bacterial spoilage, pasteurization today involves
heating a particular food (such as milk) to a specific
temperature long enough to kill Coxiella burnetii, the
causative agent of Q fever, the most heat-resistant nonspore-forming pathogen known. In the process, pasteurization also kills other disease-causing microbes. Three
U.S. government–approved time and temperature combinations can be used for pasteurization of milk. The
LTLT (low-temperature/long-time) process involves
bringing milk to a temperature of 63°C (145°F) for
30 minutes. In contrast, the HTST (high-temperature/
short-time) method (also called “fl ash pasteurization”)
brings the milk to a temperature of 72°C (161°F) for only
15 seconds. Both processes accomplish the same thing—
the destruction of C. burnetii and other bacteria—but
they do not sterilize milk. A third process, known as
ultra-high-temperature (UHT) pasteurization—134°C
(273°F) for 1–2 seconds—reduces bacterial content even
more than the LTLT or HTST methods. UHT pasteurization produces nearly sterile milk with an unrefrigerated
shelf life of up to 6 months. This is important, especially
in developing countries, where refrigeration is not always
available.
Cold. Low temperatures have two basic purposes in micro-

biology: to temper growth and to preserve strains. Bacteria not only grow more slowly in cold, but also die more
slowly. Refrigeration temperatures (4–8°C, or 39–43°F)
are used for food preservation because most pathogens are
mesophilic and grow poorly, if at all, at those temperatures.
One exception is the Gram-positive bacillus Listeria monocytogenes, which can grow reasonably well in the cold and
causes disease when ingested.
Long-term storage of bacteria usually requires placing
solutions in glycerol at very low temperatures (–70°C).
Glycerol prevents the production of razor-sharp ice crystals that can pierce cells from without or within. This
deep-freezing suspends growth altogether and keeps
cells from dying. Another technique, called lyophilization, freeze-dries microbial cultures for long-term storage. In this technique, cultures are quickly frozen at very
low temperatures (quick-freezing also limits ice crystal

can be drawn through a membrane fi lter by vacuum or can
be forced through it using a syringe (Fig. 5.27). Filter sterilization avoids the use of heat, which can damage certain

Air can also be sterilized by filtration. This process
forms the basis of several personal protective devices. A surgical mask is a crude example, while laminar flow biological safety cabinets are more elaborate (and more effective).
These cabinets force air through high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and remove over 99.9% of airborne
particulate material 0.3 μm in size or larger. Biosafety
cabinets are critical to protect individuals working with
highly pathogenic material (Fig. 5.28A and B). Newer
technologies have been developed that embed antimicrobial agents or enzymes directly into the fibers of the filter (Fig. 5.28C). Organisms entangled in these fibers are

resistance to extreme drought, since dehydration and radiation produce similar types of DNA damage.
What properties account for this microbe’s amazing
resistance to radiation? One is that D. radiodurans possesses an unusual capacity for repairing damaged DNA.
Many mechanisms are involved, including a highly efficient double-strand-break DNA repair system involving
homologous recombination (see Section 9.5). Each cell of
this organism contains four to six copies of its two chromosomes and two plasmids. So even when its DNA is
irradiated and broken into thousands of fragments, overlapping intact fragments can be found and spliced together
in proper order. A second property that contributes to radiation resistance is the ability of D. radiodurans to aggressively protect its proteins, which are even more susceptible
to radiation than is DNA. This mechanism, discovered
by Michael Daly at the Uniformed Services University of
the Health Sciences in Maryland, involves the intracellular accumulation of large amounts of manganese that
can remove highly damaging free radicals generated by
radiation.
On the basis of this research, D. radiodurans was genetically engineered to treat radioactive mercury–contaminated
waste from nuclear reactors—a process called bioremediation (discussed in Chapter 22). The genes for mercury conversion were spliced from a strain of E. coli that is resistant
to particularly toxic forms of mercury and inserted into
D. radiodurans. The genetically altered superbug was able
to withstand the ionizing radiation and convert toxic waste
into forms that could be removed safely. Fortunately, there
is little need to worry about its becoming a superpathogen,
because the organism does not cause disease and is susceptible to antibiotics.

Chemical Agents

Disinfection by physical agents is very effective, but in
numerous situations their use is impractical (kitchen countertops) or plainly impossible (skin). In these instances,
chemical agents are the best approach. A number of factors influence the efficacy of a given chemical agent. These
include:






183



Corrosiveness. The disinfectant should not corrode the
surface or, in the case of an antiseptic, damage skin.



Stability, odor, and surface tension. The chemical
should be stable during storage, possess a neutral or
pleasant odor, and have a low surface tension so that it
can penetrate cracks and crevices.

The phenol coefficient. Phenol, fi rst introduced by Joseph

Lister in 1867 to reduce the incidence of surgical infections, is no longer used as a disinfectant, because of its
toxicity, but its derivatives, such as cresols and orthophenylphenol, are still in use. The household product Lysol is a
mixture of phenolics. Phenolics are useful disinfectants
because they denature proteins, are effective in the presence of organic material, and remain active on surfaces long
after application.
Although phenol is no longer used as a disinfectant, its
potency makes it the benchmark against which other disinfectants are measured. The phenol coefficient test consists
of inoculating a fixed number of bacteria—for example,
Salmonella enterica or Staphylococcus aureus—into dilutions of the test agent. At timed intervals, samples are withdrawn from each dilution and inoculated into fresh broth
(which contains no disinfectant). The phenol coefficient
is based on the highest dilution (lowest concentration) of
a disinfectant that will kill all the bacteria in a test after
10 minutes of exposure but leaves survivors after only 5
minutes of exposure. This concentration is known as the
maximum effective dilution. Dividing the reciprocal of the
maximum effective dilution for the test agent (for example,
ethanol) by the reciprocal of the maximum effective dilution for phenol gives the phenol coefficient (Table 5.3).
For example, if the maximum effective dilution for agent X

The presence of organic matter. A chemical placed
on a dirty surface will bind to any inert organic material present, lowering the agent’s effectiveness against

higher the efficacy of the disinfectant.

Commercial Disinfectants

Ethanol, iodine, chlorine, and surfactants (for example,
detergents) are all used to reduce or eliminate microbial
content from commercial products (Fig. 5.30). The first
three are compounds that damage proteins, lipids, and
DNA. Highly reactive iodine complexed with an organic
carrier forms an iodophor, a compound that is watersoluble, stable, nonstaining, and capable of releasing iodine
slowly to avoid skin irritation. Wescodyne and Betadine
(trade names) are iodophors used, respectively, for the
surgical preparation of skin and for wounds. Chlorine is
another highly reactive disinfectant with universal application. It is recommended for general laboratory and hospital
disinfection and kills the HIV virus.
Detergents can also be antimicrobial agents. The
hydrophobic and hydrophilic ends of detergent molecules
(the coexistence of which makes the molecules amphipathic) will emulsify fat into water. Cationic (positively
charged) but not anionic (negatively charged) detergents
are useful as disinfectants because the positive charges can
gain access to the negatively charged bacterial cell and disrupt membranes. Anionic detergents are not antimicrobial
but do help in the mechanical removal of bacteria from
surfaces.
Low-molecular-weight aldehydes such as formaldehyde
(HCHO) are highly reactive, combining with and inactivating proteins and nucleic acids. This characteristic makes
them useful disinfectants.

Disposable plasticware like petri dishes, syringes,
sutures, and catheters are not amenable to heat sterilization or liquid disinfection. These materials are best sterilized using antimicrobial gases. Ethylene oxide gas (EtO)
is a very effective sterilizing agent; it destroys cell proteins,
is microbicidal and sporicidal, and rapidly penetrates packing materials, including plastic wraps. Using an instrument resembling an autoclave, EtO at 700 milligrams per
liter (mg/l) will sterilize an object after 8 hours at 38°C
or 4 hours at 54°C if the relative humidity is kept at 50%.
Unfortunately, EtO is explosive. A less hazardous gas sterilant is betapropiolactone. It does not penetrate as well as
EtO, but it decomposes after a few hours, which makes it
easier to dispose of than EtO.
A new procedure, known as gas discharge plasma sterilization, may replace EtO because it is less harmful to operators. Gas discharge plasma is made by passing certain gases
through a radio frequency electrical field to produce highly
reactive chemical species that can damage membranes,
DNA, and protein. It is not yet widely used.
Antimicrobial touch surfaces. Despite widespread use
of disinfectants and antibiotics by medical personnel,
hospital-acquired infections remain a major concern. A
promising antimicrobial technology that can help reduce
infections in hospitals and elsewhere involves embedding
antimicrobial compounds such as copper (Cu) in the surfaces that people touch. For example, a bed rail made with
copper can kill pathogens deposited by one person before
the organism can be transmitted to a second person touching the same surface. Upon contact with bacteria, metallic
copper releases toxic Cu+ ions that trigger the lysis of bacterial membranes within minutes, although the mechanism

CHAPTER 5

Bacteria Can Develop
Resistance to Disinfectants

It is widely known that bacteria can develop resistance to
antibiotics used to treat infections. This is a serious concern in the medical community. So, one might wonder
whether bacteria can also develop resistance against chemical disinfectants used to prevent infections. The answer is
yes—and no. It is difficult for a bacterium to develop resistance to chemical agents that have multiple targets and can
easily diffuse into a cell. Iodine, for example, has both of
these characteristics. However, disinfectants that have multiple targets at high concentrations may have only a single
target at lower concentrations—a situation that can foster the development of resistance. For instance, triclosan
(a halogenated bisphenol compound used in many soaps,
deodorants, and toothpastes) targets several cell constituents, making it nicely bactericidal at high concentrations.
However, at low concentrations triclosan only inhibits fatty
acid synthesis and is merely bacteriostatic. Organisms have
developed resistance to triclosan at low concentrations by
altering the fatty acid synthesis protein normally targeted
by triclosan.
Low-level resistance also can be achieved through
membrane-spanning, multidrug efflux pumps (described
in Section 4.2). For instance, the MexCD-OprJ efflux
system of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a Gram-negative bacterium that causes infections in burn and cystic fibrosis
patients, can pump several different biocides, detergents,
and organic solvents out of the cell, thereby reducing their
efficacy. This finding and other reports of Pseudomonas
gaining resistance to disinfectants have led many clinicians
to advocate caution in the widespread use of certain chemical disinfectants.
Biofilm formation is another ingenious way that bacteria
survive exposures to disinfectants. A biofilm is a 3D community of bacterial cells attached to a solid surface (see Section 4.5). A biofilm can protect cells in several ways. For
example, the extracellular matrix proteins and polysaccharides that hold biofilms together also bind disinfectants,
slowing their penetration into the deeper recesses of the
structure. Slower penetration means that cells deep in the
biofilm have time to activate protective stress response systems before destructive levels of disinfectant reach them.
Biofilms also exhibit stratified growth patterns based in
part on nutrient access (see Fig. 4.30). Cells at the periphery have ample access to oxygen and nutrients, while cells
within do not. Nutrient starvation worsens the farther a

from monospecies biofilms.

cell is from the surface. Because nutrient starvation activates stress response systems, each biofilm has stratified
layers of increasingly stress-resistant cells that can better
tolerate chemical insults.
Finally, biofilms, which contain multiple species in
nature, are opportunities for protective, interspecies collaborations (Fig. 5.31). Protective enzymes from one species could protect a nonproducing species from a chemical
insult, much as a big brother protects a little brother from a
bully. Multispecies biofilms can also be more massive than
monospecies biofilms. The food pathogen Escherichia coli
O157:H7 forms a biofilm with 400 times more volume
when grown with Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, an organism found in meatpacking plants. Increased volume alone
will slow the penetration of the disinfectant and protect the
collective.

Antibiotics Selectively Control
Bacterial Growth

Antibiotics as made in nature are chemical compounds
synthesized by one microbe to either kill or stop the growth
of other competing microbial species. Antimicrobial compounds that kill other cells are called bactericidal, whereas
compounds that merely stop growth are called bacteriostatic. Chapter 27 describes the various antibiotic modes
of action. When purified and administered to patients suffering from an infectious disease, antibiotics can produce
seemingly miraculous recoveries.

oxygen species are involved). Companies are incorporating metallic copper into objects such as handrails, door

As we saw in Chapter 1, penicillin (Fig. 5.32),
produced

Penicillium

shows this molecule, which
mimics a part of the cell wall.
Because of this mimicry, penicillin binds to biosynthetic
proteins involved in peptidoglycan synthesis and prevents
cell wall formation. The drug
is bactericidal because actively

So how do antibiotic-producing microbes avoid suicide? In some instances, the
producing organism lacks the
target molecule. Penicillium
mold, for instance, lacks peptidoglycan and is immune to
penicillin by default. Some
bacteria produce antimicrobial
compounds that target other
members of the same species.
In this case, the producing

CHAPTER 5

organism can modify its own receptors to no longer recognize the compound (as with some bacterial colicins).
Another strategy is to modify the antibiotic if it reenters the cell. This is the case with streptomycin produced
by Streptomyces griseus. Streptomycin inhibits bacterial
protein synthesis and does not discriminate between the
protein synthesis machinery of Streptomyces and that of
others. However, while making enzymes that synthesize
and secrete streptomycin, S. griseus simultaneously makes
the enzyme streptomycin 6-kinase, which remains locked
in the cell. If any secreted streptomycin reenters the cell,
this enzyme renders the drug inactive by attaching a phosphate group to it.
Because many microorganisms have become resistant
to commonly used antibiotics, pharmaceutical companies
continually search for new antibiotics using a variety of
approaches (see Special Topic 4.1). Traditional procedures
include scouring soil and ocean samples collected from all
over the world for new antibiotic-producing organisms and
chemically redesigning existing antibiotics so that they
can bypass microbial resistance strategies. Newer techniques allow scientists to “mine the genomes” of microbes
for potential drug targets and use computer-based methods to predict the structure and function of potential new
antibiotics.

Biological Control of Micro bes

Pitting microbe against microbe is an effective way to
prevent disease in humans and animals. One of the hallmarks of a healthy ecosystem is the presence of a diversity
of organisms. This is true not only for tropical rain forests and coral reefs, but also for the complex ecosystems
of human skin and the intestinal tract. In these environments, the presence of harmless microbial communities
can retard the growth of undesired pathogens. The pathogenic fungus Phytophthora cinnamomi, for example, causes
root rot in plants but is biologically controlled by Myrothecium fungi. Staphylococcus species normally present on
human skin produce short-chain fatty acids that retard the
growth of pathogenic strains. Another illustration is the
human intestine, which is populated by as many as 500
microbial species. Most of these species are nonpathogenic
organisms that exist in symbiosis with their human host.
Vigorous competition with members of the normal intestinal microbiota and the production of permeant weak acids
by fermentation helps control the growth of numerous
pathogens. A prominent example of this phenomenon is
the pathogen Clostridium difficile, whose growth is normally kept in check by gut microbiota.
Microbial competition has been widely exploited for
agricultural purposes and to improve human health



187

through the intake of probiotics. In general, a probiotic
is a food or supplement that contains live microorganisms
and improves intestinal microbial balance. Newborn baby
chicks, for instance, are fed a microbial cocktail of normal
gut microbes designed to quickly colonize the intestinal
tract and prevent colonization by Salmonella, a frequent
contaminant of factory-farmed chicken. In another example, Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have been used to
prevent and treat diarrhea in children.
Russian biologist Ilya Mechnikov, winner of the 1908
Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, was the first to
suggest that a high concentration of lactobacilli in the
gut microbiome is important for health and longevity in
humans. Yogurt is a probiotic that contains Lactobacillus
acidophilus and a number of other lactobacilli. It is often
recommended as a way to restore a normal balance to gut
microbiota (for example, after the microbiota has been
disturbed by antibiotic treatment), and it appears useful
in the treatment of some forms of inflammatory bowel
disease.
Phage therapy, another biocontrol method, was first
described in 1907 by Félix d’Herelle at France’s Pasteur
Institute, long before antibiotics were discovered. Bacteriophages are viruses that prey on bacteria (discussed in
Section 6.1). Each bacterial species is susceptible to a limited number of specific phages. Because a phage infection
often causes bacterial lysis, it was considered feasible to
treat infectious diseases with a phage targeted to the pathogen. At one time, doctors used phages as medical treatment for illnesses ranging from cholera to typhoid fever. In
some cases, a liquid containing the phage was poured into
an open wound. In other cases, phages were given orally,
introduced via aerosol, or injected. Sometimes the treatments worked; sometimes they did not. When antibiotics
came into the mainstream, phage therapy largely faded.
Now that strains of bacteria that are resistant to standard
antibiotics are on the rise, the idea of phage therapy has
enjoyed renewed interest from the worldwide medical community (Special Topic 5.1).
Commercial phage products are now available to target the food-borne pathogens E. coli O157:H7, Salmonella
enterica, and Listeria monocytogenes. E. coli O157:H7, for
instance, is a pathogen that can contaminate hamburger
and cause bloody diarrhea. The phage product contains
several different phages and is sprayed onto the hides of
cattle 1–4 hours before slaughter. Cattle carcasses are
steam-pasteurized and acid-washed to diminish bacterial
contamination. E. coli cells that manage to survive these
treatments will be infected and killed by the phage, reducing the consumer’s risk of disease. Using multiple phages
in each preparation nearly eliminates the risk that phage
resistance will develop in the pathogen.

Biofilms play an important role in many infectious disease processes. Examples include
Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infections
that plague cystic fibrosis patients and lifethreatening heart valve infections caused by
Enterococcus faecalis. It is difficult to cure
these types of infections, because many
of the pathogens responsible are resistant
to antibiotics and because biofilm architecture may hinder antibiotic and immune
cell access to bacteria nestled in the deep
recesses of the structure. What’s more,
biofilms provide a reservoir of bacteria for
chronic infections throughout the body.
With antibiotics failing, is there an alternative? A recent study by Ronen Hazan, Leron
Khalifa, and Nurit Beyth from Hebrew UniFIGURE 1
versity (Fig. 1) suggests that phage therapy
can be used to destroy biofilm infections
without antibiotics.
The model they used was tooth infection following endodontic dental procedures. Endodontic procedures remove
the nerve of a tooth because the pulp around it is infected.
Drilling to remove infected pulp and the inflamed nerve will
inadvertently allow entry of oral microbiota, such as Enterococcus faecalis, into dentinal tubules. Dentinal tubules are
thin, branching tubes that extend radially from the pulp
(the center of the tooth), through the dentine and then
stop at the enamel. Once it is within the tubules and the
canal is sealed, E. faecalis can form a biofilm infection of the
dentine.
The authors used an Enterococcus-specific bacteriophage called EFDG1 (Fig. 2) to first determine whether
the phage could destroy a 2-week-old biofilm of E. faecalis
grown in a plastic dish. The confocal fluorescent images in
Figure 3 show a biofilm without phage treatment and a similar biofilm 7 days after phage treatment. The results suggest
that phages are promising candidates for killing well-established E. faecalis biofilms.
The scientists next tested whether phage treatment
would prevent root canal infections. Extracted teeth with
exposed nerve canals were autoclaved and contaminated
with a suspension of E. faecalis. Root canal procedures were
performed on the teeth, and the canals were sealed. After
2 days, cross sections were made and stained with live/

canal itself stained nonspecifically, even in the absence of
bacteria (Fig. 4A). The results show that EFDG1 is an efficient killer of E. faecalis biofilms in this ex vivo model of
root canal infection and may be a complementary strategy
to antibiotic treatment, especially for antibiotic resistant
microbes.

6.1 Viruses in Ecosystems

ll kinds of cells, including bacteria, eukaryotes, and archaea, can be infected by viruses.
Viruses infect a host cell and use the cell’s
machinery to form progeny virions. In ecosystems,
viruses cycle nutrients, control host populations,
and promote host diversity. Viruses may kill their
host cells, or they may copy themselves into their
host genome. In humans, endogenous viral DNA
evolved into many portions of our genome. And now,
researchers engineer viruses to attack tumors, and to
conduct gene therapy.

a virus. In Michael Rossmann’s laboratory, Xinzheng Zhang
determined the chlorovirus 3D structure using cryo-electron
microscopy. Cryo-EM reveals the inner coil of DNA surrounded by the protein capsid and envelope. The capsid spike contacts the algal surface and then opens, allowing viral DNA to
penetrate the host cell. Within the cell, the viral DNA forms
virus factories that make about a thousand progeny virions.

Chlorovirus DNA

What exciting discovery has your
microscopy revealed about this virus
of algae?

Using cryo-electron microscopy, we
were able to capture several essential
steps of how the chlorovirus enters the
host cells. The infection starts when the
spike on the unique vertex of the virus
recognizes the cellular receptors. The
virus then digests the cell wall by its encoded enzyme. Meanwhile, the virus undergoes uncoating around the unique vertex. Without the cell wall and the virus capsid shell, the viral
membrane can fuse with the cellular membrane to release
the viral genome into the host cell. It is amazing that the
virus can accomplish such a comprehensive job.
What is the importance of algal viruses in the natural
world?
Phytoplankton (marine algae) play an important role in
Earth’s carbon cycle. In natural environments, viruses such
as algal viruses help control the population of phytoplankton.
Algal viruses are important in ecosystems for controlling
algal blooms.

of square kilometers (Fig. 6.1C). The pale clouds in the
water are the reflected light from billions of calcite plates,
or “coccoliths,” that coat each algal cell. Yet within a few
days, this gigantic bloom is dissipated by viruses.
Throughout the ocean, viruses play a decisive role in
controlling algal blooms. Consumer organisms apparently cannot grow fast enough to

we hear about are those that cause
epidemics, such as seasonal influenza and the AIDS pandemic.
In research, viruses provided
both tools and model systems for
our discovery of the fundamental principles of molecular biology. The first genes mapped, the
first regulatory switches defined,
and the first genomes sequenced
were all those of viruses. Vectors
for gene cloning and gene therapy continue to be derived from
viruses (see Chapter 12). Our
understanding of viruses, particularly bacterial viruses, called
bacteriophages, provides a background for the molecular biology we will encounter in Part 2
of this book (Chapters 7–12).
And remarkably, we now engineer human viruses to deliver
gene therapy and kill cancers

Viruses are everywhere. In the oceans, viruses are the most
numerous and genetically diverse forms of life. The number of viruses infecting bacteria and algae can reach 107
(10 million) per milliliter. Viruses act as a dominant consumer of marine microbes. Figure 6.1 shows an example of marine viruses infecting the algae Emiliana huxleyi

complex viruses, the protective protein may be called a
head coat or a core particle (discussed in Sections 6.3–6.5.)

6.1

Different types of viruses infect different specific host
cells. A virus that infects bacteria is called a bacteriophage
(Fig. 6.2A). Bacteriophage T2 infects the host bacterium,
E. coli. The T2 and T4 phages are “tailed” phages, whose
capsid has a tail that inserts the viral genome into the host
cell. Within the host, the phage genes direct production
and assembly of progeny virions. Virions are released when
the host cell lyses. As cells lyse, their disappearance can be
observed as a plaque, a clear spot within a lawn of bacterial
cells (Fig. 6.2B). Each plaque arises from a single virion, or
phage particle, that lyses a host cell and spreads progeny to
infect adjacent cells. The plaque count represents the number of individual infective virions from the phage suspension that was spread on the plate.
A virus that infects humans is the measles virus
(Fig. 6.2C). The measles virus has an envelope that is
derived from the host cell plasma membrane as the virus
exits the host cell. As the virus infects a new host cell, the
envelope fuses with the host cell plasma membrane, releasing the viral contents into the cytoplasm of the cell. After
replicating within the infected cell, newly formed measles virions become enveloped by host cell membrane as
they bud out of the host cell. The spreading virus generates a rash of red spots on the skin of infected patients
(Fig. 6.2D) and can be fatal (one in 500 cases).
Plants are infected by viruses such as tobacco mosaic
virus (TMV). Within the plant cell, virions accumulate
to high numbers (Fig. 6.2E) and travel through interconnections to neighboring cells. Infection by tobacco
mosaic virus results in mottled leaves and stunted growth
(Fig. 6.2F). Plant viruses cause major economic losses in
agriculture worldwide.
Historically, viruses were defined as nonliving particles,
because at first the virion was the only form to be visualized
and understood. The Russian botanist Dmitri Ivanovsky
(1864–1920) and the Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck (1851–1931) first proposed the existence of viruses
as infectious agents that passed through a filter too small for
cells to pass. Certain kinds of these infectious agents were
actually crystallized from solution. Wendell Stanley (1904–
1971) earned the 1946 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the
first crystallization of a virus, tobacco mosaic virus (TMV).
He later crystallized poliovirus. The crystallization of viruses
reinforced their definition as nonliving.
But what happens after a virus infects a cell? The first
replication cycles discovered were those of viruses that
infect bacteria, known as bacteriophages or phages.
Bacteriophage infections were first studied by English

bacteriologist Frederick William Twort (1877–1950) and
by French microbiologist Félix d’Herelle (1873–1949). To
actually reveal what went on in the host cell, Ernst Ruska
(1906–1988) used the newly invented electron microscope
(discussed in Chapter 2).
The electron micrographs in Figure 6.2 show startling
views of progeny virions infecting cells. However, they fail to
show the dynamic nature of virus replication. A remarkable
view of viral replication emerges from fluorescence microscopy (Fig. 6.3). For an RNA virus such as poliovirus or
hepatitis C virus, virions are assembled within “virus factories,” virus-induced cell compartments called a replication
complex. The micrograph in Figure 6.3 shows a cell from
rat liver tissue culture infected by hepatitis C virus. The liver
cell nucleus is surrounded by replication complexes composed of viral proteins and host-derived membranes (pinkorange fluorescence). Within each replication complex,
fluorescence arises from a viral gene fused to a gene encoding a fluorescent protein (GFP). The replication complexes
fluoresce against the dark background. The complexes move
around within the cell, as tracked by video recording. It can
be argued that the viral replication complexes themselves
behave like intracellular parasites.

Integrated Viral Genomes

Some viruses do more than replicate within a cell: they integrate their own genomes into the host genome. In effect, such

A. BENNO WÖLK, ET AL. 2008. J. VIROL 82:10519

196

viruses become a part of the host organism. A virus that integrates its genome into the DNA of a bacterial genome is called
a prophage. Within a human cell, an integrated viral genome
is called a provirus. A permanently integrated provirus transmitted via the germ line is called an endogenous virus.
How were integrated viral genomes discovered? In the
1950s, genetic analysis of bacteriophage lambda in E. coli
showed evidence of phage gene expression from within host
genomes. Bacteriophage lambda is discussed at length
in Chapter 11. Early in the twentieth century, American
cancer researcher Peyton Rous (1879–1970) discovered that
some avian viruses cause tumors. The tumor generation
results from integration of a viral genome. For this discovery,
Rous won the 1966 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.
But the biggest surprise emerged from decades of study
of the genomes of host organisms. Many host cell traits turn
out to be expressed by integrated viral genomes, or prophages, that actually confer benefits on their host. For example, Nostoc cyanobacteria possess a prophage that encodes
nitrogenase, an enzyme for nitrogen fixation. Many human
pathogens, such as Staphylococcus aureus, contain prophages
encoding toxins. Human genomes show evidence of much
genetic material arising from viral genomes that integrated
into host DNA, only to mutate and get “stuck” in the host.
As much as half of the human genome may have arisen from
viruses or from virus-like elements of DNA called transposons (discussed in Chapter 9). For example, some endogenous viral genomes express placental proteins that are
essential for early development of human embryos.

Dynamic Nature of Viruses

Emerging evidence supports a dynamic view of viral existence, and leads us to revisit the question: What is a virus?
Is a virus a living organism? We now know that a virus may
interconvert among three very different forms (Fig. 6.4):


Virion, or virus particle. The virion is an inert particle consisting of nucleic acid enclosed by a protein capsid. Some viruses package enzymes and possess a lipid
envelope. A virion does not carry out any metabolism or
energy conversion.



Intracellular replication complex. Within a host cell,
the viral gene products direct the cell’s enzymes to
assemble progeny virions at “virus factories” called replication complexes. Assembly requires host ribosomes,
as well as intricate collaboration between host and viral
proteins.



Viral genome integrated within host DNA. Some
types of viral genomes may integrate within a host chromosome and replicate as part of the host. Integration
may be permanent; alternatively, the viral genome may
be reactivated to start assembling virions.

 Virus as a subcellular organism. The virion, or
virus particle, consists of a nucleic acid genome contained by a protein
capsid. A virion may infect a host cell and cause the cell’s enzymes to
synthesize progeny virions. Alternatively, infection may lead to integration of the viral genome within the host cell genome. Integration
may last indefinitely, or else may lead to production of virions.

The inert nature of the virion (particle), which lacks
metabolism, argues that viruses are nonliving. However,
we know that cellular life-forms such as bacteria can convert into inert forms such as endospores that remain viable
for thousands of years. The virion assembly process argues
that viruses are living organisms. Assembly includes metabolism and production of progeny, processes we see for obligate
intracellular bacteria such as chlamydias. Furthermore, the
genomes of large viruses such as chloroviruses show evidence
of reductive evolution (evolutionary loss of genes) from a cell.
On the other hand, genome integration argues for
a view of viruses as host cell components. Many bacteria
regulate phage-encoded genes along with their own genes
(discussed in Chapter 10). For example, Vibrio cholerae, the
cause of cholera, uses bacterial genes to regulate expression
of the cholera toxin, which is encoded by an integrated prophage. For the V. cholerae bacterium, the viral prophage is a
functional part of the cell.
How and where did viruses originate? Did they form
within host cells, or did they arise as independent entities?
Giant viral genomes encode numerous metabolic enzymes,
including aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (enzymes that
attach an amino acid to the transfer RNA for translation).



VIRUSES



197

The size and complexity of giant viruses argue that these
viruses evolved by reductive evolution of an intracellular
parasitic bacterium. Similar arguments are made for large
viruses such as the smallpox and herpes viruses. On the
other hand, small viruses with small RNA genomes, such
as influenza virus and HIV, look more like something that
arose from parts of a cell. For example, the key retroviral
enzyme reverse transcriptase (which copies RNA to DNA)
shows homology to telomerase, a host cell enzyme that
maintains chromosome ends. Viral origins are discussed
further in eTopic 6.1.

Viral Ecology

While viruses are the tiniest of biological entities, they play
starring roles in ecosystems. Acute viruses (which rapidly kill
their hosts) act as predators or parasites to limit host population density. They also recycle nutrients from their host
bodies. An increase in host population density increases the
rate of transmission of viral pathogens. As the host population declines, viruses are less likely to find a new host before
they lose infectivity, while many of the remaining hosts have
undergone selection for resistance. Thus, viruses can limit
host density without causing extinction of the host.
In a community of multiple host species, the overall
effect of viruses is to increase host diversity. Each viral species has a limited host range and requires a critical population density to sustain the chain of infection. In marine
phytoplankton, a virus limits its host species to a population density far lower than what is sustainable by the
available resources, such as light for photosynthesis. The
resources then support other species resistant to the given
virus (but susceptible to other ones). Thus, overall, marine
viruses prevent the dominance of any one species and foster
the evolution of many distinct host species. The continual
threat of marine viral epidemics explains the great diversity of phytoplankton ranging from silica-shelled diatoms
to toxin-producing dinoflagellates.
Persistent viruses (viruses that don’t immediately kill
the host) may benefit the host population overall. Most
important, viruses transfer genes across species, conferring
traits such as the ability to metabolize new food sources.
Humans harbor many obscure herpes and cold-type viruses
that stimulate normal development of the immune system.
In natural mammal populations, a persistent virus can act
as a bioweapon that kills off competitor populations susceptible to the virus. An example is the koala retrovirus,
KoRV, which has become endogenous (persistent) in many
koala populations of Australia. When KoRV is transmitted to koalas that lack the retrovirus, it kills most of those
newly infected—except for the few in which the virus persists. In these infected animals, the immune system controls the virus but cannot eradicate it.

Integrated viral genomes can evolve complex symbiotic
interactions with multiple hosts, combining mutualism
and parasitism. An example is the relationship of polydnaviruses, wasps, and caterpillars (Fig. 6.5). Parasitoid
wasps lay their eggs inside a living insect caterpillar, where
the larvae must hatch and feed without stimulating the
caterpillar’s defense. The wasp genome contains an integrated genome (or provirus) of a virus called polydnavirus.
The polydnavirus forms its own genomes and virions only
within the wasp ovary. When the wasp deposits her eggs
inside the host caterpillar, she also deposits her mutualistic
virions. The virions express proteins that prevent the caterpillar cells from undergoing encapsulation, a process that
would otherwise wall off the wasp eggs and kill them.
In marine ecosystems, viruses play a significant role in
the cycling of food molecules (Fig. 6.6). In ocean food
webs, phytoplankton is consumed by grazers, and grazers are eaten by higher trophic consumers (discussed
in Chapter 21). But at each level, some of the carbon
fixed as biomass sinks to the ocean floor. There, benthic
microbes metabolize so slowly that most carbon is effectively removed from the carbon cycle. At the same time,
viral infection and lysis convert the
bodies of phytoplankton, grazers,
and carnivores into detritus consisting of small organic particles and

soluble molecules. The viral detritus gets taken up by heterotrophs,
and minerals are absorbed by autotrophs. This uptake of viral detritus is called the viral shunt. The

and protease inhibitors. The molecular biology behind
anti-HIV drugs is discussed in Chapters 11 and 27.

Thought Question

6.2 Search for some specific viruses on the Internet. Which
viruses do you think have a narrow host range, and which have
a broad host range?

Viral Disease

When viral infection causes harm to an animal or plant, the
host has a disease. Each species of virus infects a particular group of host species, known as its host range. Some
viruses can infect only a single species; for example, HIV
infects only humans. Close relatives of humans, such as
the chimpanzee, are not infected by HIV, although they
are susceptible to a highly related virus, simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). By contrast, West Nile virus, transmitted by mosquitoes, infects many species of birds and
mammals. West Nile virus has a much broader host range
than HIV and SIV.
For humans, viruses cause many forms of illness. The
influence of viral diseases on human history and culture
would be hard to overstate. More people died of influenza in the global epidemic of 1918 than in the battles
of World War I. Poliovirus is famous for causing the outbreaks of poliomyelitis that swept the United States during
the first half of the twentieth century. President Franklin Roosevelt, himself a victim of the disease, established a
national foundation called the March of Dimes to develop
a vaccine. The spectacular success of the March of Dimes
set the pattern for future public support of research on
cancer and AIDS.
Chronic viral infections, however, are more common
than acute disease, and are an everyday part of our lives.
The most frequent infections of college students are due
to respiratory pathogens such as rhinovirus (the common
cold) and Epstein-Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis),
as well as sexually transmitted viruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and papillomavirus (genital warts). Some
viruses, such as rhinoviruses, are eliminated rapidly by our
immune system, whereas others, such as herpes, establish a
lifelong latent infection. Viruses also impact human industry; for example, bacteriophages (literally, “bacteria-eaters”) infect cultures of Lactococcus during the production
of yogurt and cheese. Plant pathogens such as cauliflower
mosaic virus and rice dwarf virus cause substantial losses in
agriculture.
In contrast to our vast arsenal of antibiotics (effective
against bacteria), the number of antiviral drugs remains
small. Because the machinery of viral growth is largely
that of the host cell, viruses present relatively few targets
that can be attacked by antiviral drugs without harming
the host. An exception is human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV), the cause of AIDS. Molecular studies of HIV have

To Summarize












Viruses can exist as a virion (inert virus particle), as the
intracellular assembly of virion components, or as a viral
genome integrated within host cell DNA.
All classes of organisms are infected by viruses. Usually the hosts are limited to a particular host range of
closely related strains or species.
Acute virus infection limits host population density. Virus-associated mortality may increase the genetic
diversity of host species.
Persistent viruses remain in hosts, where they may
evolve traits that confer positive benefits in a virus-host
mutualism.
Marine viruses infect most phytoplankton, releasing
their minerals in the upper water, where they are available for other phototrophs. Viral activity substantially
impacts the global carbon balance.
Viruses transfer genes between host genomes. Viral
gene transfer is a major source of cell genome evolution.

6.2

Virus Structure

The structure of a virion keeps the viral genome intact, and
it enables infection of the appropriate host cell. First, the
stable capsid protects the viral genome from degradation
and enables it to be transmitted outside the host. Second,
in order for the viral genome to reproduce, the virion must
either insert its genome into the host cell or disassemble
within the host. In the process, the original particle loses
its stable structure and its own identity as such. But if viral
reproduction succeeds, then it yields numerous progeny
virions.
A virion possesses a genome of either DNA or RNA,
contained by proteins that compose the capsid. The form
of the virion depends on the species of virus. The virion
may be symmetrical or asymmetrical, or combine aspects

of both. The papillomavirus virion, for example, consists
solely of a capsid containing a genome. Some viruses, such
as the tailed bacteriophages, have an elaborate delivery
device to transfer the viral genome into the host cell. Other
viruses possess a membrane envelope. The protein capsid of
an enveloped virus is called a core particle.
Understanding virus structure is crucial for devising vaccines and drug therapies. For example, the Gardasil vaccine for human papillomavirus, HPV (recommended for
all children before adolescence), is composed of capsid proteins from four different HPV strains. The molecular basis
of viral structure and drugs is presented in Chapter 11.

Thought Question

6.3 What will happen if a virus particle remains intact within
a host cell and fails to release its genome?

Symmetrical Virions

A symmetrical virus may have a capsid of one of two types:
icosahedral or filamentous (helical). Some have an intermediate form, such as the HIV core. The advantage of geometrical symmetry is that it provides a way to form a package out
of repeating protein units generated by a small number of
genes and encoded by a short chromosomal sequence. The
smaller the viral genome, the more genome copies can be
synthesized from the host cell’s limited supply of nucleotides.
Nevertheless, some symmetrical viruses, such as herpes virus
and mimivirus, have much larger genomes. Large genomes
offer a greater range of functions for viral components.

Icosahedral viruses. Many viruses package their genome

in an icosahedral (20-sided) capsid. An icosahedral
capsid takes the form of a polyhedron with 20 identical
triangular faces. In the capsid, each triangle can be composed of three identical but asymmetrical protein units.
An icosahedral capsid is found in the herpes simplex virus
(Fig. 6.7A). Each triangular face of the capsid is determined by the same genes encoding the same protein subunits. The actual form of viral subunits can vary greatly,
generating very different complex shapes for different viral
species. But no matter what the pattern of subunits in the
triangular unit, the structure overall shows the rotational
symmetry of an icosahedron (Fig. 6.7B): threefold symmetry around the axis through two opposed triangular
faces, fivefold symmetry around an axis through opposite points, and twofold symmetry around an axis through
opposite edges.

Thought Question

6.4 For a viral capsid, what is the advantage of an icosahedron,
as shown in Figure 6.7, instead of some other polyhedron?

Virus particles can be observed by standard transmission electron microscopy (TEM), but the details of
capsid structure as in Figure 6.7A require digital reconstruction of cryo-EM images (discussed in Section 2.6).
Recall from Chapter 2 that in cryo-EM, the viral samples
for TEM are flash-frozen, preventing the formation of
ice crystals. Flash-freezing enables observation without

stain. The electron beams penetrate the object; thus,
images of individual capsids actually provide a glimpse
of the virus’s internal contents. By digitally combining
and processing cryo-TEM images from a number of capsids, a 3D reconstruction is built for the entire virus particle. Within the icosahedral capsid, the herpes genome is
spooled and tightly packed. Figure 6.7C shows that the
double-stranded DNA of the herpes genome is packed
under high pressure. A molecular motor powered by
ATP drives viral DNA into the host nucleus (discussed in
Chapter 11).
In some icosahedral viruses, such as HIV, the capsid
(called a core particle) is enclosed in an envelope membrane.
The envelope is composed of host-derived membrane from
the host cell in which the virion formed; it also contains
proteins specified by the viral genome. The HIV envelope
derives from host plasma membrane, whereas other viruses,
such as herpes virus, derive their envelope from intracellular membranes such as the nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. The envelope and capsid contents of herpes
virus are shown in Figure 6.8.

VIRUSES



201

The space between the capsid and
the envelope contains “tegument”
proteins, such as enzymes that interact with the host cell to depress its
defense responses. Tegument proteins are expressed during infection
of a host cell, and then get packaged
in the virion. Both viral and host
proteins may be packaged as tegument. The mature envelope bristles
with glycoprotein spike proteins that
attach it to the capsid. The spike proteins enable the virus to attach and
infect the next host cell. Further
details of herpes structure and function are presented in Section 11.5.

Note:

Distinguish the viral envelope (phospholipid membrane
derived from a host cell membrane) from the bacterial cell envelope (protective layers outside the bacterial cell membrane). The
bacterial envelope is discussed in Chapter 3.

Filamentous viruses. A second major category of virus struc-

ture is that of filamentous viruses. A famous example is Ebola
virus (Fig. 6.9A), which causes a fatal disease of humans and
related primates; the virus caused a major epidemic in 2014
(discussed in Chapter 28). A filamentous bacteriophage that
infects E. coli is phage M13 (Fig. 6.9B). Filamentous bacteriophages cause problems for human medicine and industry. One infects the Gram-positive species Propionibacterium
freudenreichii, a key fermenting agent for Swiss cheese.
Another filamentous phage, CTXϕ, integrates its sequence
into the genome of Vibrio cholerae, where it carries the deadly
toxin genes required for cholera. On the other hand, filamentous phages have been used in nanotechnology to nucleate
the growth of crystalline “nanowires” for electronic devices.
The filamentous bacteriophage M13 (Fig. 6.9B)
consists of a relatively simple capsid of protein monomers.

Filamentous viruses show helical symmetry. The pattern of capsid monomers forms a helical tube around the
genome, which usually winds helically within the tube. In
a helical capsid, the genome is a single-stranded DNA (as
in phage M13) or RNA (as in tobacco mosaic virus). Figure 6.10 shows how the RNA strand of tobacco mosaic
virus winds in a spiral within a tube of capsid monomers

Some bacteriophages supplement the icosahedral capsid or

the capsid or in the tegument between the core envelope and
the outer membrane, which is coated with surface tubules of
protein. Large asymmetrical viruses contain so many enzymes
that they appear to have evolved from degenerate cells.
Vaccinia virus offers opportunities for new applications, such as conversion to vaccines for other viruses, and
engineering to combat tumors. For example, students in
Paulo Verardi’s laboratory at the University of Connecticut (Fig. 6.12C) recently engineered an on/off switch for
vaccinia that will make the virus safer for immunocompromised patients. The switch involves a recombinant tetracycline repressor gene, whose product confers resistance to
tetracycline. Repressor controls and engineering are discussed in Chapters 10 and 12.

Asymmetrical Virions

Many viruses have a capsid or core particle that is asymmetrical. Influenza viruses are RNA viruses that lack capsid symmetry. Instead, the RNA segments are coated with
nucleocapsid proteins (discussed in detail in Chapter 11).
The poxviruses, such as vaccinia (cowpox, the source of
smallpox vaccine) have a double-stranded DNA genome stabilized by covalent connection of its two strands at each end
(Fig. 6.12A and B). The core envelope encloses the nucleocapsid-coated DNA, as well as a large number of accessory
proteins. The accessory proteins are needed early in viral
infection, such as initiation proteins for the transcription of
viral genes and RNA-processing enzymes that modify viral
mRNA molecules. The proteins may be found either inside

Viroids: infective RNA. Potato spindle tuber viroid consists of a circular single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) that hybridizes internally.

of plants. A viroid encodes no genes, but it hijacks the plant
cell’s RNA polymerase to replicate itself. Viroids infect
many kinds of fruits and vegetables, entering the plant cell
through a damaged cell wall. For example, citrus viroids
cause economic losses in the citrus industry.
The potato spindle tuber viroid (Fig. 6.13) consists
of a circular, single-stranded molecule of RNA that doubles back on itself to form base pairs interrupted by short,
unpaired loops. This unusual circularized form avoids
breakdown by host RNase enzymes. The RNA folds up
into a globular structure that interacts with host cell proteins. The RNA is replicated by host RNA polymerase. The
host RNA polymerase normally requires a DNA template,
but the replication process is modified during viroid infection. During infection, the RNA polymerase thus replicates
progeny copies of the viroid, which encodes no products
other than itself. Viroids can cause as much host destruction as “true viruses,” and some authors, particularly in
plant pathology, classify them as “viruses without capsids.”
Some viroids have catalytic ability, comparable to
enzymes made of protein. An RNA molecule capable of
catalyzing a reaction is called a ribozyme (discussed in
Chapter 8). Viral ribozymes may be able to cleave themselves or other specific RNA molecules. Their ability to
cleave very specific RNA sequences has applications in
medical research, such as cleaving human mRNA involved
in cancer.
Can an infectious agent propagate without a genome of
its own? A remarkable class of infectious agents is believed
to consist solely of protein. These agents, known as prions,
are thought to be aberrant proteins arising from the host
cell. Prions gained notoriety when they were implicated in
brain infections such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a variant form of which is known as “mad cow” disease because
it may be transmitted through defective proteins in beef
from diseased cattle. Other diseases believed to be caused
by prion transmission include scrapie, a disease of sheep;
and kuru, a degenerative brain disease that was found in
a tribe of people who customarily consumed the brains of
deceased relatives.

In prion-associated diseases, the infective agent is
unaffected by treatments that destroy R NA or DNA,
such as nucleases or UV irradiation. A prion is an aberrant form of a normal cell protein that assumes an abnormal conformation or tertiary structure (Fig. 6.14A).
The prion form of the protein acts by binding to normally folded proteins of the same class and altering
their conformation to that of the prion. The multiplying
prion then alters the conformation of other normal subunits, forming harmful aggregates in the cell and ultimately leading to cell death. In the brain, prion-induced
cell death leads to tissue deterioration and dementia

CHAPTER 6

(Fig. 6.14B). Prion diseases are unique in that they can
be transmitted by an infective protein instead of by DNA
or R NA, and they propagate the conformational change
of existing molecules without synthesizing entirely new
infective molecules.
A prion disease can be initiated by infection with an
aberrant protein. More rarely, the cascade of protein misfolding can start with the spontaneous misfolding of an
endogenous host protein. The chance of spontaneous misfolding is greatly increased in individuals who inherit certain alleles encoding the protein; thus, Creutzfeld-Jakob
disease can be inherited genetically from one person with
one mutant allele.

To Summarize















A virion consists of a capsid or a core particle enclosing a nucleic acid genome. For some viruses, the capsid is further enclosed by an envelope of membrane
with embedded proteins.
A viral capsid is composed of repeated protein subunits—a structure that maximizes the structural capacity while minimizing the number of genes needed for
construction.
The capsid or core particle packages the viral genome
and delivers it into the host cell.

for the mode of infection, and for the course of a viral
disease. Viral genomes are used as the basis of virus
classification.

Viral Genomes: Small or Large

Small viruses commonly have a small genome, encoding fewer than ten genes. For example, cauliflower mosaic
virus (diameter 50 nm) has a genome encoding only seven
genes (Fig. 6.15A), which actually overlap each other in
sequence. This overlap in sequence is made possible by the
use of different reading frames—start positions to define
the first base of the codon for translation to an amino acid
sequence (discussed in Chapter 8).
Many small viral genomes consist of RNA. RNA viruses
include some of today’s most important human pathogens, such as influenza virus, hepatitis C virus, and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The RNA genome of avian
leukosis virus (Fig. 6.15B) has protein-encoding genes
grouped by functional categories of core capsid, replication
enzymes, and envelope proteins (proteins embedded in the
envelope phospholipid bilayer).
At the opposite end of the scale, the “giant viruses” have
genomes of double-stranded DNA comprising 500–2,500

genes. A giant virus called mimivirus (diameter 300 nm),
which infects amebas and may cause human pneumonia, is
itself as large as some bacteria (Fig. 6.16A) and has a bacterium-sized genome of 1.2 million base pairs, encoding more
than 1,000 genes. Discovered in 2003 by French virologist Didier Raoult and colleagues, mimivirus has a genome
that encodes numerous cellular functions, including DNA
repair and protein folding by chaperones. The virus gains
entry to its ameba host by phagocytosis, because its large
particle size makes the virus particle resemble a bacterium
that the ameba could engulf for food. Once taken up, the
mimivirus capsid opens to release viral enzymes and DNA.
Within the ameba’s cytoplasm, the viral enzymes generate
a replication complex that produces progeny mimiviruses.
Mimiviruses are so large that they can actually become
infected themselves by smaller viruses, such as the Sputnik
virophage, or “virus-eater” (Fig. 6.16B).
A surprising source of giant viruses is the frozen polar
environments of the Arctic and Antarctic regions. Antarctic lakes reveal giant viruses related to Mimivirus and the
Sputnik virophage. The Arctic tundra of Siberia reveals even
more remarkable viruses, such as Pithovirus (Fig. 6.17).
Pithovirus is an unusual lozenge-shaped virus, nearly the
size of bacteria such as E. coli. Jean-Marie Claverie and colleagues from Aix-Marseille University isolated Pithovirus
from Siberian tundra frozen for 30,000 years. Remarkably, a virion so old was successfully inoculated into an
ameba host, where it generated progeny virions. In 2015,
yet another Siberian giant virus, Mollivirus sibericum, was
revived and found to package ribosomal proteins from its
host ameba—the first virus ever shown to contain parts of
a ribosome. The revival of ancient viruses leads to concern

viruses of a different class of genome (such as RNA). In
1971, David Baltimore proposed that the primary distinctions among classes of viruses be the genome composition
(RNA or DNA) and the route used to express messenger
RNA (mRNA). Baltimore, together with Renato Dulbecco (1914–2012) and Howard Temin (1943–1994), was
awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
for discovering how tumor viruses cause cancer.

CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY

All cells and viruses need to make messenger RNA to
produce their fundamental protein components. The production of mRNA from the viral genome is central to a
virus’s ability to propagate its kind. Cellular genomes
always make mRNA by copying double-stranded DNA.
For viruses, however, different kinds of genomes require
fundamentally different mechanisms to produce mRNA.
The different means of mRNA production generate distinct groups of viruses with shared ancestry.
So far, the genome composition and mechanisms of replication and mRNA expression define seven fundamental groups
of viral species (Fig. 6.19). Examples of these seven fundamental groups are shown in Table 6.1. A more extensive taxonomic survey of viral species is presented in Appendix 2.
Group I. Double-stranded DNA viruses such as the
herpes and smallpox viruses make their own DNA poly-

Group III:
Double-stranded RNA
Requires RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase to make
mRNA and genomic RNA.

Group II. Single-stranded DNA viruses such as canine
parvovirus require the host DNA polymerase to generate
the complementary DNA strand. The double-stranded
DNA can then be transcribed by host RNA polymerase.
Group III. Double-stranded RNA viruses require a
viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to generate
messenger RNA by transcribing directly from the RNA
genome. Since the RNA polymerase is required immediately upon infection, such viruses package a viral RNA
polymerase with their genome before exiting the host
cell. A major class of double-stranded RNA viruses is
the reoviruses, including rotavirus, a cause of diarrhea
in children. Another reovirus has been engineered to
destroy human tumors without infecting normal cells.
This “oncolytic” reovirus, called Reolysin, is now in
clinical trials for cancer therapy.
Group IV. (+) sense single-stranded RNA viruses consist of a positive-sense (+) strand (the coding strand) that
can serve directly as mRNA to be translated to viral proteins. Replication of the RNA genome, however, requires
synthesis of the template (–) strand [complementary to
the (+) strand] by a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to form a double-stranded RNA intermediate.

210



PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

Positive-sense (+) RNA viruses include enteroviruses
such as poliovirus, the coronaviruses, and the flaviviruses
that cause West Nile encephalitis and hepatitis C.
Group V. (–) sense single-stranded RNA viruses such
as influenza virus have genomes that consist of template,
or “negative-sense,” RNA. Thus, they need to package
a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase for transcribing (–) RNA to (+) mRNA. The (–) strand RNA viral
genomes are often segmented; that is, they consist of
multiple separate linear chromosomes—a key factor in the
evolution of killer strains of influenza (see Section 11.2).
Group VI. Retroviruses, or RNA reverse-transcribing viruses, such as HIV and feline leukemia virus,
have genomes that consist of (+) strand RNA. Instead
of RNA polymerase, they package a reverse transcriptase, which transcribes the RNA into a double-stranded
DNA (for details, see Section 11.3). The doublestranded DNA is then integrated into the host genome,
where it directs the expression of the viral genes.
Group VII. Pararetroviruses, or DNA reversetranscribing viruses, have a replication cycle that
requires reverse transcriptase. For example, hepatitis B
virus (a hepadnavirus) first copies its double-stranded
DNA genomes into RNA, and then reverse-transcribes
the RNA to progeny DNA using a reverse transcriptase
packaged in the original virion. In contrast, plant pararetroviruses, such as cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV, a
caulimovirus), generate an RNA intermediate that replicates using a reverse transcriptase made by the host
cell. Many plant genomes include a gene for reverse
transcriptase. Cauliflower mosaic virus is of enormous agricultural significance for its use as a vector to
construct pesticide-resistant food crops.

Molecular Evolution of Viruses

The phylogeny, or genetic relatedness, of viruses can be
determined within families. For example, the herpes family includes double-stranded DNA viruses that cause several human and animal diseases, such as chickenpox,
oral and genital herpes infection, and respiratory and
genital infections in horses. Herpes genomes consist of
double-stranded DNA, 120–220 kilobases (kb) encoding
about 70–200 genes; an example is that of varicella-zoster
virus, the causative agent of chickenpox (Fig. 6.20A). The
genome includes two “unique” segments of genes, one
long and one short (U L and US), joined by two inverted
repeats (IRs). Other herpes genomes share similar structure, though they differ in gene order and IR position.
The relatedness of different herpes viruses that evolved
from a common ancestor can be measured by comparing

their genome sequences. Comparison is based on orthologous
genes, or orthologs. Orthologs are genes of common ancestry
in two genomes that share the same function (a topic discussed
in Chapter 8). For cellular organisms, we often use the ribosomal RNA gene sequences to measure relatedness. Viruses
have no ribosomal RNA, but closely related viruses share other
orthologous genes. In pairs of orthologs, the amount of difference in sequence correlates approximately with the time following divergence from a common ancestor (a topic discussed
in Chapter 17). A tree of genomic divergence (or phylogeny)
was devised for herpes viruses (Fig. 6.20B). The comparison
of all gene pairs places herpes strains into three related classes
designated alpha, beta, and gamma (Fig. 6.20B). The alpha
class includes human varicella-zoster virus and the oral and
genital herpes viruses (HSV-1 and HSV-2), as well as equine

CHAPTER 6

herpes virus. The beta class includes cytomegalovirus, a common cause of congenital infections (present at birth), as well as
two lesser-known viruses. The gamma class includes EpsteinBarr virus (the cause of infectious mononucleosis), as well as
several viruses of animals. Divergence of phylogenetic trees is
discussed further in Chapter 17.
Gene comparison generates a tree for closely related
viruses such as herpes. But how can we assess phylogeny
of more distantly related viruses that share no genes—
and even have genomes of different kinds of nucleic acids?
Unlike cells, viruses do not possess genes common to all
species. Furthermore, viral genomes are highly mosaic; that
is, they evolved from multiple sources. Mosaic genomes
result from recombination or reassortment of chromosomes from different viruses coinfecting a host.
In some cases, phylogeny is inconsistent with the fundamental chemical composition of the genome. For example,

some DNA bacteriophages actually share closer ancestry
with RNA bacteriophages than they do with DNA animal
viruses. This is because two or more viruses can coinfect a
cell and exchange genetic components. Thus, the genomic
content of a virus can be influenced by its host range.
Thought Question

6.5 How could viruses with different kinds of genomes
(RNA versus DNA) combine and share genetic content in their
progeny?

To Summarize


The bacteriophage proteomic tree.

Comparison of all proteins encoded by each genome predicts
distinct groups of bacteriophages. Within each group, there are
subgroups of phages with shared hosts, since sharing of hosts
facilitates genetic recombination and horizontal transfer of genes
between different phages. Source: Based on Forest Rohwer and Rob A.
Edwards. 2002. J. Bacteriol. 184:4529.

VIRUSES

As more viral genomes are sequenced, classification methods have been devised to take advantage of sequence information without requiring gene products common to all species.
One promising approach is that of proteomics, analysis of
the proteome, the proteins encoded by genomes (discussed
in Chapter 10). Proteins are identified through biochemical
analysis of virus particles and through bioinformatic analysis of protein sequences encoded in the genomes. Proteomic
analysis is useful for distantly related viruses because protein sequences often show relatedness that is obscured in
the nucleic acid sequence by silent mutations (discussed in
Chapter 9). Even if only a few proteins are shared by any two
viruses, statistical comparison of all proteins in a set of viral
species reveals underlying degrees of relatedness.
Inophage
An example of virus classification based on pro(ssDNA)
teomic analysis is that of the “proteomic tree” of bactephage M13

Bacteriophages:
The Gut Virome

Viruses display a remarkable diversity of ways to replicate
within a host cell. Here, we discuss the key modes of bacteriophage replication, and their consequences for host cells.
We focus on the best-known bacteriophages, those of the
mammalian intestinal community. Gut bacteriophages, or
“coliphages,” are part of a microbial community that modulates human digestion, the immune
system, and mental health.
Historically, bacteriophages have
provided some of the most fundamental insights in molecular biology.
In 1952, Alfred Hershey and Martha
Chase showed that the transmission
LPS
of DNA by a bacteriophage to a host
cell led to the production of progeny bacteriophages, thus confirming
that DNA is the hereditary material.
OmpF
In 1950, André Lwoff and Antoinette Gutman showed that a phage
genome could integrate itself within a
bacterial genome—the first recognition that genes could enter and leave
a cell’s genome. Other fundamental
concepts of the genetic unit and the
basis of gene transcription came from
experiments on bacteriophages, as
discussed in Chapters 7–9.

Bacteriophages
Infect a Host Cell

To commence an infection cycle,
bacteriophages need to contact
and attach to the surface of an

appropriate host cell. Contact and attachment are mediated
by cell-surface receptors, proteins on the host cell surface
that are specific to the host species and that bind to a specific viral component. A cell-surface receptor for a virus is
actually a protein with an important function for the host
cell, but the virus has evolved to take advantage of the protein. For example, phages that infect Salmonella enterica
can use outer membrane proteins such as OmpF or TolC,
which is part of a drug efflux complex (Fig. 6.22). Alternatively, a phage might bind to LPS (lipopolysaccharide; see
Chapter 3). The phage-receptor binding is usually highly
specific; a bacterium can evolve resistance through singleamino-acid mutations in its protein. The lambda phage
receptor protein (maltose porin) of E. coli is described in
Chapter 11.
Most bacteriophages (phages) inject only their genome
into a cell through the cell envelope, thus avoiding the
need for the capsid to penetrate the molecular barrier of the
cell wall. For example, the phage T4 virion has a sheath that
contracts, bringing the head near the cell surface to inject
). The pressure of the spooled

site-specific DNA recombinase. This excised phage chromosome then initiates a lytic cycle.

expelling the DNA into the cell. After the genome has been
inserted, the phage capsid remains outside, attached to the
cell surface. The empty capsid is termed a “ghost” because
of its pale appearance in an electron micrograph.
The lytic cycle. A lytic cycle of replication generates a large

number of progeny phages and then lyses the defunct cell.
The lytic replication cycle requires these steps:


Host recognition and attachment. A phage particle
must contact a receptor molecule and adhere to a host cell.



Genome entry. The phage genome must enter the host
cell and gain access to the cell’s machinery for gene
expression.



Assembly of phages. Phage components must be expressed
and assembled. Components usually “self-assemble”; that
is, the joining of their parts is favored thermodynamically.



Exit and transmission. Progeny phages must exit the
host cell, and then reach new host cells to infect.

In a lytic cycle, when a phage particle injects its genome
into a cell, it immediately reproduces as many progeny
phage particles as possible (Fig. 6.23B). The process of
reproduction involves replicating the phage genome, as well
as expressing phage mRNA to make enzymes and capsid
proteins. Some phages, such as T4, digest the host DNA to
increase the efficiency of phage production. Phage particles
assemble, and the host cell lyses, releasing progeny phages.
The phage adsorbs to its host receptor and inserts its
double-stranded DNA into the host cytoplasm. The phage
genes are then expressed by the host cell RNA polymerase
and ribosomes. “Early genes” are expressed early in the
lytic cycle. Other phage-expressed proteins then work
together with the cellular enzymes and ribosomes to replicate the phage genome and produce phage capsid proteins.
The capsid proteins self-assemble into capsids and package
the phage genomes—a process that takes place in defined
stages, like a factory assembly line. At last, a “late gene”
from the phage genome expresses an enzyme that lyses the
host cell wall, releasing the mature virions. Lysis is also
referred to as a burst, and the number of virus particles
released is called the burst size.
Lysogeny. A temperate phage, such as phage lambda, can
infect and lyse cells like a virulent phage, but it also has an
alternative pathway: to integrate its genome as a prophage
(see Fig. 6.23B). The phage is said to “lysogenize” the
host, leading to a state called lysogeny. Phage lambda has
a linear genome of double-stranded DNA, which circularizes upon entry into the cell. The circularized genome then
recombines into that of the host by site-specific recombination of DNA. In site-specific recombination, a recombinase enzyme aligns the phage genome with the host DNA

and exchanges the DNA backbone linkages with those of
the host genome. (This process of DNA backbone recombination is explained in Chapter 9.) The DNA recombination event thus integrates the phage genome into that of
the host. Now integrated, the phage genome is called a
prophage. The presence of the prophage prevents further
infection (superinfection) by other virions of the same type.
In lysogeny, the prophage DNA is replicated along with
that of the host cell as the host reproduces (Fig. 6.23B).
The host gains the benefit of resistance to superinfection.
Implicit in the term “lysogeny,” however, is the ability of
such a strain to generate a lytic burst of phage. For a lysogen to enter lysis, the prophage directs its own excision
from the host genome by an intramolecular process of sitespecific recombination. The two ends of the phage genome
exchange their DNA linkages so as to come apart from the
host DNA, which now closes its circle with the prophage
removed. As the phage DNA exits the host genome, it circularizes and initiates a lytic cycle, destroying the host cell
and releasing phage particles.
How does a lysogen “decide” to reactivate and begin a
lytic cycle? The decision between lysogeny and lysis is determined by proteins that bind DNA and repress the transcription of genes for virus replication (discussed in Chapter 11).
Exit from lysogeny into lysis can occur at random, or it can
be triggered by environmental stress such as UV light, which
damages the cell’s DNA. The regulatory switch of lysogeny
responds to environmental cues indicating the likelihood
that the host cell will survive and continue to propagate the
phage genome. If a cell’s growth is strong, it is more likely
that the phage DNA will remain inactive, whereas events
that threaten host survival will trigger a lytic burst. Similarly,
in animal viral infections such as herpes, an environmental
stress triggers reactivation of a virus that was dormant within
cells (a latent infection). Reactivation of a latent herpes infection results in painful outbreaks of skin lesions.
During the exit from lysogeny, the virus can acquire
host genes and pass them on to other host cells. The process of transferring host genes is known as transduction.
Sometimes a transducing bacteriophage picks up a bit of
host genome and transfers it to a new host cell. In another
kind of transduction, the entire phage genome is replaced
by host DNA packaged in the phage capsid, resulting in
a virus particle that transfers only host DNA. Host DNA
transferred by viruses can become permanently incorporated into the infected host genome, providing genes that
express products useful to the host (Table 6.2).
The mechanisms of phage-mediated transduction are
discussed in Chapter 9. In natural environments, phage
transduction mediates much of the recombination of
bacterial genomes. In the laboratory, the ability of phages
to transfer genes provided some of the first vectors for
recombinant DNA technology (see Chapter 12).

The slow-release cycle. A slow-release replication cycle differs from lysis and lysogeny in that phage particles reproduce without destroying the host cell (Fig. 6.24). Slow
release is performed by fi lamentous phages such as phage
M13. In slow-release replication, the single-stranded circular DNA of M13 serves as a template to synthesize a
double-stranded intermediate. The double-stranded intermediate slowly generates single-stranded progeny genomes,
which are packaged by supercoiling and coated with capsid proteins. The phage particles then extrude through the
cell envelope without lysing the cell. The host cell continues to reproduce, though more slowly than uninfected
cells do, because many of its resources are diverted to virus
production.

THE MICROBIAL CELL

SPECIAL TOPIC 6.1- $Virus to the Rescue
When your environment heats up, what can help you survive?
Viruses can, according to Marilyn Roossinck, at the Samuel
Roberts Noble Foundation in Oklahoma, and her student
Regina Redman. Redman and Roossinck identified a mysterious virus in a fungus, Curvularia protuberata, which grows
associated with a panic grass, Dichanthelium lanuginosum, in
Yellowstone National Park. The fungus, C. protuberata, grows
as an “endophyte” within the vasculature of the grass—a
highly common form of symbiosis (discussed in Chapter 21).
What is remarkable about this fungus-plant pair is that each
partner confers thermal tolerance (heat resistance) on the
other (Fig. 1). Together, the plant and fungus grow at temperatures as high as 65°C—which commonly occur in the vicinity
of Yellowstone’s thermal springs. Separately, the fungus and
plant each grow at temperatures no higher than 38°C, typical
of their species.
A.

Roossinck knew that fungi harbor many diverse viruses,
and that viruses often mediate fungus-plant interactions.
She hypothesized that a fungal virus might be involved in the
thermotolerance. To hunt for a virus, she used northern blot
(probing RNA transcripts with labeled DNA) to analyze the
fungal RNA for small double-stranded segments (dsRNA) typical of fungal viruses (double-stranded RNA; Table 6.1, Group
III). The northern blot revealed two viral dsRNAs that form the
genome of a previously unknown virus. Roossinck ultimately
named the virus Curvularia thermal tolerance virus (CThTV).
But does thermal tolerance require the virus? To answer
this question, Roossinck had to isolate CThTV virions from
the virus’s fungal host (Fig. 2A). She then conducted experiments comparing plants colonized by fungi with and without
the virus. She found that only the fungi infected with CThTV
could enable the plant Dichanthelium lanuginosum to grow

Integrated Viruses as Host Cell Parts

Many prophages and endogenous viruses function as part
of their host cell. Table 6.2 shows examples of prophages
that express virulence genes for pathogenic bacteria—a
benefit to the pathogen, enabling it to better colonize the
host animal. For example, phage C1 in Clostridium botulinum expresses the peptide botulinum toxin. This toxin
causes the paralysis associated with botulism (and is also
the basis of the Botox cosmetic treatment.) In Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the cause of diphtheria, the diphtheria
toxin is expressed by beta phage. Other virulence factors
(proteins that enhance disease) expressed by prophages
include envelope proteins that help defend the bacterium
from the immune system.

Analogous to bacterial prophages, many human genes
and gene control elements have evolved from human
viruses, particularly human endogenous retroviruses
(HERVs). Retroviruses are a category of virus that includes
HIV, the cause of AIDS (discussed in Section 6.5, and in
greater detail in Chapter 11). HERVs are reverse-transcribing RNA viruses whose DNA copies became permanently
fixed in our chromosomes. For example, placental proteins
called “syncytin” mediate cell fusion during an early stage
of placental development, allowing the fused syncytium to
implant in the uterine lining and access the maternal blood
supply. Two genes for syncytin evolved from HERV genes
encoding retroviral envelope proteins. The details of the
remarkable story of endogenous retroviruses—and the

at high temperature. Remarkably, the virus-infected fungus could also confer thermal tolerance on tomato plants
(Fig. 2B). Thus, the virus-fungus mutualism may confer a
specific thermotolerance property on various plant species—
including plants important for agriculture.
Redman has now joined the Symbiogenics agricultural
research firm, to extend her work using endophytic fungi to
protect commercial rice plants from heat and salt stress. The
viral components of these fungus-plant mutualisms are as
yet unknown, but they offer exciting prospects for sustaining
agriculture during climate change.

Chapter 11.
The virus-host relationship often evolves in response to
environmental stress. The role of virus-host mutualism in
stressed plants offers exciting possibilities for agriculture
(see Special Topic 6.1).

Bacterial Defenses

In natural environments, viruses commonly outnumber
cellular microbes by tenfold or more. So how have host
cells evolved to defend themselves? Several remarkable
resistance mechanisms have evolved. Their molecular basis
is explained in greater detail in Chapters 7 and 9.

Genetic resistance. All bacteria acquire random mutations in
their genomes as they reproduce (see Chapters 7 and 9). When
attacked by bacteriophages, bacterial populations undergo
natural selection; mutants that happen to be harder to infect
will survive. Bacteria resist phage infection by expressing a
gene that encodes an altered host receptor protein, which fails
to bind the viral coat protein. Alternatively, a different cellular protein evolves to block phage binding to the receptor. An
evolutionary “arms race” ensues, in which phages may evolve
enzymes that cleave the host defense molecules.
Restriction endonucleases. Bacteria modify their DNA by

adding methyl groups to bases within certain sequences.
The bacteria then express restriction endonucleases,

218



PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

enzymes that cleave DNA lacking the methylated patterns—which includes potential virus DNA (see Chapter 7). However, phage genomes composed of RNA or of
modified DNA (such as phage T4, discussed in Chapter 11)
escape cleavage by these enzymes.
CRISPR: a bacterial immune system. Amazingly, bacteria

possess an adaptive defense against viruses that is analogous to an immune system. (Adaptive immunity of humans
is presented in Chapter 24.) The bacterial adaptive defense
involves short DNA sequences homologous to DNA of
phages that could infect the cell. The sequences are called
clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPR). When a phage attacks a bacterium, if bacterial
enzymes succeed in destroying the phage DNA, they may
copy a tiny piece of it as a CRISPR segment, inserted as
a spacer at the head of a long line of about 30 CRISPR
sequences (Fig. 6.25).

Thought Question

6.7 How might a phage evolve resistance to the CRISPR host
defense (outlined in Fig. 6.25)?

Now the adapted host cell “remembers” infection by the
specific phage—along with many other previous phages
from previous infections that had inserted other spacers.
The next time the adapted host cell is attacked by the same
phage, all of its genomic CRISPR sequences are expressed
as RNA. The CRISPR RNA is cleaved into small sequences
(crRNA) containing one spacer from the original bacterial
DNA. The crRNA binds to the Cascade protein complex
(or Cas complex), which now detects phage DNA homologous to its virus-derived crRNA. The Cas-crRNA complex
proceeds to cleave the phage DNA, preventing phage replication. For more details of this exciting molecular defense
system, see Chapter 9.

The Gut Bacteriophage Community

How do bacteriophages impact microbial communities?
The best-understood phage community is that of the gut
virome. A virome is a community of viruses within a host
ecosystem (for example, the human or other animal intestinal tract). We present some of the major phage-host interactions within the human intestinal tract in Figure 6.26.
Note that this simplified diagram omits the viruses that

gets copied as a “spacer”
into the host genome. If the
bacterium survives infection,

kind of phage causes transcription of the spacers into
CRISPR RNA. A processed

complex to recognize and
cleave the phage DNA.

infect human body cells; we focus here on the phages that
infect gut bacteria.
The human intestines contain a remarkably dense microbial community. Bacterial and archaeal cells are estimated
at 1011–1013 cells per gram, whereas phage particles are
estimated at 109 per gram. The phage count is likely underestimated, as it is based on detection by electron microscopy and plate counts of viability (discussed in Section 6.6).
In addition, more than half the genomes sequenced from
gut bacteria show lysogeny, commonly with several different types of prophage in a given genome. The prophages
may protect the gut bacteria from superinfection by some
of the many types of phages present in the gut.
The gut community receives continual influx of new
bacteria and phages, while shedding present members
(Fig. 6.26). When a new type of phage enters, what happens? If the phage encounters a susceptible host bacterium, it may undergo a lytic cycle, lysogeny, or slow release,
depending on the phage’s genetic program. Cell lysis may
have the effect of depopulating a dominant population of
the bacterial community. What is the result? One possible
result is intestinal “dysbiosis,” deterioration of health due

Excreted phages
and bacteria

to loss of health-enhancing bacteria. Another bacterial species, less healthy for the host, may increase in population.
But now, a different phage species (DNA shown red) may
depopulate the newly risen species, restoring equilibrium
in the community. Still other phages may transfer useful
genes from newcomer bacteria, such as genes encoding
enzymes to metabolize new kinds of food molecules.
Some prophages of pathogenic bacteria express virulence
factors, such as the Shiga toxin of Shigella and of E. coli
O157:H7 (Table 6.2). At the same time, research yields
intriguing evidence for phage effects that are positive:


Phages may limit the bacterial numbers to levels that
the human immune system can tolerate. Lysogenized
bacteria may use quorum sensing to detect host cell populations and “decide” whether to start a lytic cycle.



Phage particles may modulate immune system activity by suppressing T-cell activation and tumor formation
(T-cells are discussed in Chapter 24).



Phages may attack biofilms. Biofilms of pathogens such as
Pseudomonas aeruginosa may be eroded by phage infection.

220



PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

The positive potential of bacteriophages has led researchers to investigate the engineering of phages for phage therapy. An idea dating back to the early twentieth century,
phage therapy was eclipsed by the rise of antibiotics. Today,
as we face growing antibiotic resistance in pathogens, we are
taking another look at therapeutic uses of bacteriophages
(Chapters 5 and 11).

To Summarize


Host cell-surface receptors mediate the attachment of
bacteriophages to a cell and confer host specificity.



Lytic cycle. A bacteriophage injects its DNA into a host
cell, where it utilizes host gene expression machinery to
produce progeny virions.



Lysogeny. Some bacteriophages can insert their genome
into that of the host cell, which then replicates the phage
genome along with its own. A lysogenic bacterium can
initiate a lytic cycle.



Gene transfer. Genes are transferred by phage processes
of transduction and lysogeny.



Slow release. Some bacteriophages use the host machinery to make progeny that bud from the cell slowly, slowing growth of the host without lysis.



Bacterial host defense. Bacteria have evolved several
forms of defense against bacteriophage infection, such as
altered receptor proteins, restriction endonucleases, and
CRISPR integration of phage DNA sequences.



The gut bacteriophage community includes phages that
infect, lyse, or lysogenize bacterial hosts. Gut phages impact
bacterial community structure, transfer genes among bacteria, and modulate the human gut immune system.

6.5

Animal and Plant Viruses

Animal and plant viruses solve problems similar to those
faced by bacteriophages: host attachment, genome entry and
gene expression, virion assembly, and virion release. The more
complex structure of eukaryotic cells, however, requires viral
replication cycles that are more complex. Viral reproduction
may involve intracellular compartments such as the nucleus or
secretory system and may depend on tissue and organ development in multicellular organisms. Studies of animal virus
replication reveal potential targets for antiviral drugs, such as
protease inhibitors for HIV (discussed in Chapter 11).

Note:

The virus replication cycles in this chapter are simplified.
For greater molecular detail of selected viruses, see Chapter 11.

Animal Viruses Show Tissue Tropism

Like bacteriophages, animal viruses evolve by the fitness
advantage of binding specific receptor proteins on their
host cell. An example of a human virus-receptor interaction is that of rhinovirus (see Table 6.1, Group IV),
which causes the common cold. R hinovirus attaches
to ICAM-1, a human glycoprotein (protein with sugar
chains) needed for intercellular adhesion (Fig. 6.27A).
The rhinovirus binds to a domain of ICAM-1 essential for ICAM-1 to bind a lymphocyte protein called
integrin.
The host receptors play a key role in determining the
host range, the group of host species permitting infection.
Within a host, receptor molecules can also determine the
viral tropism, or ability to infect a particular tissue type
within a host. Some viruses, such as Ebola virus, exhibit
broad tropism, infecting many kinds of host tissues,
whereas others, such as papillomavirus, show tropism for
only one type (in the case of papillomavirus, the epithelial tissues). Tropism may depend on the virus’s ability to
interact with the cytoplasm, or it may require the presence
of an appropriate host cell receptor protein that can bind
the viral surface attachment protein. For example, poliovirus infects only a specific class of human cells that display
the immunoglobulin-like receptor protein PVR. Mice lack
the PVR protein on their cell surfaces, and they are not
normally infected by polio, but when transgenic mice were
engineered to express PVR on their cells, the mice could
then be infected.
Tissue-specific receptors determine the host tropism
of avian influenza strain H5N1. The H5N1 strain infects
birds by binding to a glycoprotein receptor on cell surfaces of the avian respiratory tract. The H5N1 strain
requires a receptor protein with a sialic acid sugar chain
terminating in galactose linked at the C-3 position (alpha2,3), common in the avian respiratory tract. In humans,
however, most nasal upper respiratory cells have receptors with galactose linked at the C-6 position (alpha-2,6).
Human cells with the C-3 linkage are more common in
the lower respiratory tract. That is why avian influenza
H5N1 infection of humans has been relatively rare. However, only a small mutation in the H5N1 envelope protein could enable it to bind to the alpha-2,6 receptor more
effectively, allowing rapid transmission between humans.
The molecular basis of influenza infection is discussed
further in Chapter 11.

Thought Question

6.8 How could humans undergo natural selection for resis-

tance to rhinovirus infection? Is such evolution likely? Why or
why not?

PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

Genome entry and uncoating. Most animal viruses, unlike

bacteriophages, enter the host cell as virions. The contents
of the virion (genome and matrix proteins) may then interact with the cell in several different ways. For example, measles virus, a paramyxovirus, enters the cell by binding host
receptor proteins, thereby causing the viral envelope to fuse
with the host cell membrane (Fig. 6.27B). The measles
RNA genome coated by nucleocapsid proteins is released
directly into the cytoplasm. For other types of viruses, the
entire virion is internalized within an endosome. The internalized capsid undergoes uncoating, a process in which
the capsid comes apart, releasing the viral genome into the
cytoplasm. Uncoating is shown for a flavivirus, hepatitis C
virus (Fig. 6.27C). The hepatitis C virion is fi rst taken up
by endocytosis. In endocytosis, the cell membrane forms a
vesicle around the virion and engulfs it, forming an endocytic vesicle. The endocytic vesicle fuses with a lysosome,
whose acidity activates entry of the capsid into the cytoplasm. The capsid then comes apart, and the viral genome
is uncoated.
Yet other kinds of viruses, such as adenovirus, enter the
cell by endocytosis but require transport to the nucleus
(Fig. 6.27D). Following endocytosis and lysosome fusion,
the adenoviral genome loses some of its capsid proteins
(partial uncoating). A capsid protein then disrupts the
endocytic membrane, allowing the remaining capsid to
exit. The capsid then docks at a nuclear pore and injects
its DNA genome into the nucleus. The adenoviral DNA is

A.

replicated by its own adenoviral DNA polymerase (carried
in the virion), but it uses host nuclear histones for DNA
packing, as well as host transcription factors available in
the nucleus.

Animal Virus Replication Cycles

How does a virus replicate within an animal cell? The replication cycle of a given virus depends on the form of the
viral genome. A DNA genome can use some or all of the
host replication enzymes. An RNA genome, however, must
encode either an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase to generate an RNA template or a reverse transcriptase to generate a DNA template, in the case of retroviruses.
DNA virus replication. An example of a double-stranded
DNA virus is human papillomavirus (HPV) (see Table 6.1,
Group I), the cause of genital warts (Fig. 6.28A). HPV
is the most common sexually transmitted disease in the
United States and one of the most common worldwide.
Certain strains infect the skin, whereas others infect the
mucous membranes through genital or anal contact (sexual
transmission). Like phage lambda, papillomavirus has an
active reproduction cycle and a dormant cycle in which the
viral genome integrates into that of the host.
HPV initially infects basal epithelial cells (Fig. 6.28B).
In the basal cells, papilloma virions enter the cytoplasm by
receptor binding and membrane fusion. The virion then

undergoes uncoating via disintegration of the protein capsid or coat, releasing its circular, double-stranded genome
(Fig. 6.29). The uncoated viral genome enters the nucleus,
where it is replicated by the host DNA polymerase and
transcribed by the host RNA polymerase. The viral mRNA
molecules then return to the cytoplasm for translation of
capsid proteins, which return to the nucleus for assembly
of virions.
The process of HPV reproduction is complicated by
the developmental progression of basal cells into keratinocytes (mature epithelial cells), and ultimately cells to be
shed or sloughed off from the surface (see Fig. 6.28B).

Viral replication is largely inhibited until the basal cells
start to differentiate into keratinocytes. Host cell differentiation induces the viral DNA to replicate and undergo
transcription by host polymerases. The mRNA transcripts
then exit the nuclear pores, as do host mRNAs, for translation in the cytoplasm. The translated capsid proteins,
however, return to the nucleus for assembly of the virion.
Nuclear virion assembly is typical of DNA viruses (with
the exception of poxviruses, which replicate entirely in the
cytoplasm).
How do HPV virions disseminate, and how may they
cause cancer? As the keratinocytes containing HPV complete differentiation, the cells start to come apart and are
shed from the epithelial surface. Cells release HPV virions
during this shedding process. But in the basal cells, HPV has
an alternative pathway of integrating its genome into that
of the host (analogous to phage lysogeny). The integrated
genome can transform host cells into cancer cells. Cells
are transformed to cancer through increased expression of
viral oncogenes (cancer-causing genes; see eTopic 26.1). The
oncogenes inhibit the expression of host tumor suppressor
genes. Certain HPV strains are more likely to cause cancer
than others. The most common strains are preventable by
the Gardasil vaccine.
RNA virus replication. The picornaviruses include poliovirus, the cause of paralytic poliomyelitis; and rhinoviruses,
which cause the common cold (see Table 6.1, Group IV).
Picornavirus genomes contain (+) strand RNA, allowing
the virus to replicate entirely in the cytoplasm, without any
DNA intermediates.
A picornavirus binds to a surface receptor, such as
ICAM-1 for rhinovirus or the PVR receptor for poliovirus. The (+) strand RNA is uncoated by insertion through
the cell membrane into the cytoplasm—much as a bacteriophage inserts its genome into a cell (Fig. 6.30). The role
of endocytosis is debated; poliovirus requires no endocytosis, but the rhinovirus genome may require endocytosis and
low-pH induction.
After uncoating, a gene in the picornavirus RNA is
translated by host ribosomes to make RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase. The polymerase uses the viral RNA
template to make (–) strand RNA. The (–) strand RNA
then serves as a template for other viral mRNAs, as well
as for progeny genomic (+) RNA. These RNA molecules
are synthesized within virus-induced vesicles or replication complexes formed from the endoplasmic reticulum. Capsid proteins are synthesized by host ribosomes,
and the capsids self-assemble in the cytoplasm. Virions
then assemble at the cell membrane and are released by
subverting lysosomes, which attempt to digest them.
For greater detail of the poliovirus replication cycle,
see eTopic 11.3.

Note that other kinds of RNA viruses, such as influenza
virus, encapsidate a (–) strand genome. In this case, the
(–) strand must serve as the template to generate mRNA,
as well as a (+) secondary template for (–) strand progeny
genomes. Influenza virus replication includes other interesting molecular complications, discussed in Chapter 11.
RNA retroviruses. Retroviruses include human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of AIDS;
and feline leukemia virus (FeLV), the cause of feline leukemia, a disease that commonly affl icts domestic cats (see
Table 6.1, Group VI). A retrovirus such as HIV uses a
reverse transcriptase to make a DNA copy of its RNA
genome (Fig. 6.31). Instead of being translated from
an early gene, the reverse transcriptase is actually carried

within the virion, bound to the RNA genome with a primer
in place. The virion contains two (+) strand RNA copies of
the HIV genome, each carrying its own reverse transcriptase. Virions infect helper T cells and other lymphocytes of
the active immune system (discussed in Chapter 24). After
uncoating in the cytoplasm, the viral RNA is copied into
double-stranded DNA.
The DNA copy then enters the nucleus, where a viral
integrase enzyme integrates the DNA into the host genome.
To generate virions, a host RNA polymerase transcribes the

CHAPTER 6

viral genome into viral mRNA and viral genomic RNA.
The reverse transcriptase has a high error rate, generating
slightly different versions of the virus—some of which can
evade host defenses and antiviral drugs. The viral mRNA
reenters the cytoplasm for translation to produce coat proteins, reverse transcriptase, and envelope proteins. The
coat proteins are transported by the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the cell membrane, where virions self-assemble
and bud out. Alternatively, a retrovirus may transmit from
cell to cell through cytoplasmic nanotubes (introduced in
Chapter 3), which avoid viral destruction by the immune
system.
At a certain point, infected cells can suddenly begin to
generate large numbers of virions, destroying the immune
system. The cause of accelerated reproduction is poorly
understood, although it involves cytokines released under
stress conditions such as poor health or pregnancy. HIV
replication is activated via protein regulators encoded by the
virus. The full process of HIV reproduction is described in
Chapter 11.

Thought Question

6.9 From the standpoint of a virus, what are the advantages

and disadvantages of replication by the host polymerase, compared with using a polymerase encoded by its own genome?

Oncogenic viruses. As many as 20% of human cancers are

caused by oncogenic viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus
(which causes lymphomas) and hepatitis C virus (which
causes liver cancer). (Hepatitis C replication is discussed
in eTopic 11.4.) When these viruses infect a cell, instead of
destroying it the virus may transform the cell to divide and
grow out of control. For a virus, the advantage of cancer
transformation is that it expands the population of infected
cells that produce virus particles, or that replicate a viral
genome hidden within a host chromosome.
How do oncogenic viruses cause cancer? Several different mechanisms enable different types of viruses to
transform normal host cells to proliferate abnormally and
form tumors.




Oncogenes. A retrovirus such as feline leukemia virus
(FeLV) may carry an oncogene, which can transform the
host cells. Usually an oncogene encodes an abnormal
form of a host protein that controls cell proliferation.
Genome integration. Certain DNA viruses, such as
human papillomavirus, can integrate their genome
into a host chromosome. The integrated viral genome
expresses proteins that stimulate host cell division and
may ultimately lead to growth of tumors.





VIRUSES



225

Cell cycle control. Oncogenic viruses such as papillomaviruses express oncogenes for proteins that interact
with cell cycle controls and can stimulate uncontrolled
growth.

Viral capacities for gene transfer and host genome control may be manipulated artificially and used for gene therapy. In fact, some of the most dangerous viruses, such as
HIV, are being engineered to make nonvirulent gene delivery devices (discussed in Section 11.4).
Chronic viral infections. Some human viruses appear in

our bodies indefi nitely, causing either mild disease or
none. For example, anelloviruses commonly appear in
our blood plasma, without known disease. Children frequently shed enteroviruses (viruses of the intestinal tract,
related to poliovirus) with no known effects. Some evidence supports the idea that low-level chronic viral infections might actually enhance the function of our immune
system.

Plant Virus Replication Cycles

All kinds of plants are subject to viral infection. Plant
viruses pose enormous challenges to agriculture, especially
where the concentrated growth of a single strain of food
crop (monoculture) provides ideal conditions for a virus
to spread.
Plant virus entry to host cells. In contrast to animal
viruses and bacteriophages, plant viruses infect cells by
mechanisms that do not involve specific membrane receptors. The reason may be that plant cell membranes are covered by thick cell walls impenetrable to virion uptake or
genome insertion. Thus, the entry of plant viruses usually requires mechanical transmission, nonspecific access
through physical damage to tissues, such as abrasions of
the leaf surface caused by a feeding insect. Mechanical
transmission of plant viruses is limited by the cell wall.
Most plant viruses gain entry to cells by one of three
routes:


Contact with damaged tissues. Viruses such as tobacco
mosaic virus appear to require nonspecific entry into
broken cells.



Transmission by an animal vector. Insects and nematodes transmit many kinds of plant viruses. For example,
the geminiviruses are inoculated into cells by planteating insects such as aphids, beetles, and grasshoppers.



Transmission through seed. Some plant viruses enter
the seed and infect the next generation.

An economically important plant virus is the potyvirus called plum pox virus, a major pathogen of plums,

peaches, and other stone fruits. Plum pox virus, a Group
IV (+) strand RNA virus, is transmitted by aphids
(Fig. 6.32). Following infection, the spread of the virus
generates streaked leaves and flowers, as well as ringshaped pockmarks on the surfaces of the fruit and of the
stone within.
Plant virus transmission through plasmodesmata. Within

a plant, the thick cell walls prevent a lytic burst or budding out of virions. Instead, plant virions spread to
uninfected cells by traveling through plasmodesmata
(singular, plasmodesma). Plasmodesmata are membrane
channels that connect adjacent plant cells (Fig. 6.33).
The outer channel connects the cell membranes of the
two cells; the inner channel connects the endoplasmic
reticulum.
Passage through the plasmodesmata requires action
by movement proteins whose expression is directed by
the viral genome. In some cases, the movement proteins
transmit the entire plant virion; in other cases, only the
nucleic acid itself is small enough to pass through. The
infection strategies of plant viral genomes may have features in common with those of viroids, which lack capsids
altogether.

(see Table 6.1, Group VII). CaMV is an important tool
for biotechnology because it has a highly efficient promoter
for gene transcription, allowing high-level expression of
cloned genes. Vectors derived from caulimoviruses are used
to construct transgenic plants.
CaMV is transmitted by secretions from an insect
whose bite damages plant tissues, providing access to the

cytoplasm (Fig. 6.34). The CaMV
genome moves from the cytoplasm to
the cell nucleus through a nuclear pore.
Within the nucleus, two promoters on
its DNA genome direct transcription
to RNA. The two RNA transcripts exit
the nucleus for translation by host ribosomes to make viral proteins. A host
reverse transcriptase, present in plant
cells, copies the RNA into DNA viral
genomes. After virions are assembled in
the cytoplasm, virus-encoded proteins,
called movement proteins, help transfer the virions through plasmodesmata
into an adjacent cell.
A CaMV promoter sequence is
commonly used in gene transfer vectors for plant biotechnology because
transcription of the gene (such as
one that confers pesticide resistance
on the host) linked to the viral promoter is very efficient. In the field,
10% of cruciferous vegetables are typically infected with caulif lower mosaic

Animal and Plant Host Defenses

How do animals and plants defend themselves from virus
infection? Since viruses are ubiquitous, a wide range of
defense mechanisms have evolved. Defenses important for
humans are part of our immune system, presented in Chapters 23 and 24.

cleared. The basis of this resistance is a defective allele
encoding a T-lymphocyte cell-surface protein that acts as
a coreceptor, which is required for binding of virus HIV-1.
The role of coreceptors in HIV infection and resistance is
discussed further in Chapter 11.

Genetic resistance. As we saw for bacteria, animal and

Immune system. The immune system of humans and other
animals possesses extensive cellular machinery to thwart
viral infection. A component of our innate immunity is the
class of proteins called interferons, which recognize general signs of viral infections such as the presence of doublestranded RNA (see Chapter 23). For adaptive immunity,
viral proteins expressed in the cell membrane of an infected
cell are recognized by specific antibodies that stimulate immune cells to destroy the infected cell and halt its
viral production. The antibodies recognize a specific virus
strain, such as a strain of influenza virus to which the individual has been exposed previously. For example, during
the 2009 flu epidemic, many individuals over the age of
50 had some protection arising from exposure to a similar
strain in an earlier epidemic (see Chapter 24).

plant hosts continually experience mutations, some of
which lead to strains that resist viral infection by halting adsorption or some other key step of the virus’s replication cycle. When a virus becomes widespread, natural
selection favors resistant strains. But commercial livestock
and crops are typically a monoculture in which no resistant variants are available. Thus, when an outbreak arises,
an entire crop may be destroyed. To save a crop, it may be
interbred with a wild strain that possesses genes conferring resistance.
An example of genetic resistance in humans is resistance
to HIV/AIDS. In populations where HIV prevalence is
high, rare individuals emerge whose cells are not infected,
or are infected at such low rates that the virus is eventually

PART 1



THE MICROBIAL CELL

RNA interference. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a mecha-

nism by which mRNA molecules expressed by a viral genome
are recognized by a host protein-RNA complex that shuts
down further expression. RNA interference was first discovered in plants, where the system is most extensive, but it
is now known to be widespread among all eukaryotes and
archaea (discussed in Chapter 9). The mechanisms of RNA
interference are now being engineered for use in gene therapy
to halt gene expression in cancer and in inherited diseases.



RNA viruses use an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase
to transcribe their messenger RNA.



Retroviruses use a reverse transcriptase to copy their
genomic sequence into DNA for insertion in the host
chromosome.



Oncogenic viruses transform the host cell to become
cancerous. Mechanisms of oncogenesis by different
types of viruses include insertion of an oncogene into
the host genome, integration of the entire viral genome,
and expression of viral proteins that interfere with host
cell cycle regulation.



Plant viruses enter host cells by transmission through a
wounded cell surface or an animal vector. Plant viruses
travel to adjacent cells through plasmodesmata.



Pararetroviruses contain DNA genomes but generate
an RNA intermediate that requires reverse transcription
to DNA for progeny virions.



Emerging viral pathogens increase during environmental change.

Emergence of Viral Pathogens

Where does a “new virus” come from? Most human pathogens come from other humans, or from related animals
called vectors. Certain human-infecting viruses persist in
the wild, such as rabies virus and West Nile virus. Their persistence requires broad host ranges; rabies infects many different mammals, whereas West Nile virus infects birds as
well as humans and horses. Understanding the epidemiology of rabies or of West Nile encephalitis requires understanding the behavior and seasonal migration patterns of
wild organisms. In 2002, the SARS respiratory disease was
caused by a coronavirus previously unknown to science.
The coronavirus was eventually traced genetically to viruses
found in bats and in civet cats marketed for food, in the area
of Guangdong, China, where the human outbreak began.
Other emerging viruses arise as variants of endemic
milder pathogens. Viruses long associated with a host,
such as the common-cold viruses (rhinoviruses), tend to
have evolved a moderate disease state that provides ample
opportunities for host transmission. A virus that “jumps”
from an animal host, however, may cause a more acute syndrome with higher mortality. The best-known cases are the
exceptionally virulent emerging strains of influenza, which
generally result from intracellular recombination of human
strains with strains from pigs or ducks (discussed in Chapter 11). For example, in 2013 the avian influenza strain
H7N9 emerged from poultry in China, where it killed several people before it was contained. Changing distribution
patterns of insect vectors and animal hosts can generate
new epidemics of a pathogen in regions where the virus
could not spread before. Such changes in distribution can
be brought about by many factors, including global climate
change (eTopic 6.2 and Chapter 28).

To Summarize


Host cell-surface receptors mediate animal virus attachment to a cell and confer host specificity and tropism.



Animal DNA viruses either inject their genome or
enter the host cell by endocytosis. The viral genome
requires uncoating for gene expression.

6.6

Culturing Viruses

To learn how microbes grow, we culture them in the laboratory. So how do we culture a virus? A complication of
virus culture is the need to grow the virus within a host
cell. Therefore, any virus culture system must be a double culture of host cells plus viruses. Culturing viruses of
multicellular animals and plants involves additional complications, as viruses show tropism for particular tissues or
organs. Viruses may replicate in tissue culture, but the tissue culture does not show all the properties of an organ
within a living organism. Therefore, a virus propagated in
tissue culture will evolve to lose some of the virulence factors needed to infect an animal.

Batch Culture

Batch culture, or culture in an enclosed vessel of liquid
medium, enables growth of a large population of viruses
for study. Bacteriophages can be inoculated into a growing culture of bacteria, usually in a culture tube or a flask.
The culture fluid is then sampled over time and assayed for
phage particles. The growth pattern usually takes the form
of a step curve (Fig. 6.35).
To observe one cycle of phage reproduction, phages are
added to host cells at a multiplicity of infection (MOI,
ratio of phage to cells) such that every host cell is infected.
The phage particles immediately adsorb to surface receptors
of host cells and inject their DNA. As a result, intact virions

plateau.

are virtually undetectable in the growth medium. This
short period after infection is called the eclipse period.
For some species, it is possible to distinguish between the
eclipse period and a latent period, the time during which
the inserted phage genome directs production of progeny
virions. The virions accumulate within the cell but have not
yet emerged in the medium. In animal viruses, the latent
period is less distinct because large numbers of virions usually generate progeny through budding out of the host cell
(Fig. 6.36).

Note:

The “latent period” of a lytic virus is the period between
initial phage-host contact and the first appearance of progeny
phage. This must be distinguished from the “latent infection” of a
virus that maintains its genome within a host cell without reproducing virions.

As cells begin to lyse and liberate progeny viruses, the
culture enters the rise period, during which virus particles
appear in the growth medium. The rise period ends when
all the progeny viruses have been liberated from their host
cells. If the number of viruses that go on to inoculate additional host cells is small, then the virus concentration at the
end point divided by the original concentration of inoculated phage approximates the burst size—that is, the number of viruses produced per infected host cell. To estimate
the burst size, we can divide the concentration of progeny
virions by the concentration of inoculated virions, assuming that all the original virions infect a cell.
The burst size, together with the cell density prior
to lysis, determines the concentration of the resultant

suspension of virus particles, called a lysate. In the case
of bacteriophages, a lysate of phage particles can be
extremely stable, remaining infective at room temperature for many years. Eukaryotic viruses, however, tend
to be less stable and need to be maintained in culture or
deep freeze.

Thought Question

6.10 Why does bacteriophage reproduction give a step

curve, whereas cellular reproduction generates an
exponential growth curve? Could you design an experiment
in which viruses generate an exponential curve? Under what
conditions does the growth of cellular microbes give rise to
a step curve?

Tissue Culture of Animal Viruses

In the case of animal and plant viruses, the multicellular
nature of the host is an important factor in the pathology
and transmission of the pathogen (discussed in Chapters 25
and 26). Animal viruses can be cultured within whole animals by serial inoculation, where virus is transferred from
an infected animal to an uninfected one. Culture within
animals ensures that the virus strain maintains its original virulence (ability to cause disease). But the process
is expensive and laborious, involving the large-scale use
of animals.
A historic event in 1949 was the first successful growth
of a virus in tissue culture. Poliovirus, the causative agent

of the devastating childhood disease poliomyelitis, was
grown in human cell tissue culture (Fig. 6.37) by John F.
Enders, Thomas J. Weller, and Frederick Robbins at Children’s Hospital in Boston. As heralded that year in Scientific American, “It means the end of the ‘monkey era’ in
poliomyelitis research.… Tissue-culture methods have provided virologists with a simple in vitro method for testing
a multitude of chemical and antibiotic agents.” Since then,
tissue culture has remained the most effective way to study
the molecular biology of animal and plant viruses and to
develop vaccines and antiviral agents.
Some viruses can be grown in a tissue culture of cells
growing confluently on a surface. The cells must be
immortalized—that is, genetically altered—to continue
cell division indefinitely. The fluid bathing the tissue layer
is sampled for virus concentration. As in the case of bacteriophage batch culture, we can define an eclipse period, a
latent period before appearance of the first progeny virions
in the culture fluid, and a rise period. In tissue culture, the
time course of animal virus replication is usually much longer (hours or days) than that of bacteriophages (typically
less than an hour under optimal conditions). The burst
size of animal viruses, however, is typically several orders
of magnitude larger than that of phages. The reason for the
larger burst size is probably that the volume of a host cell is
much larger than that of a bacterial host, thus providing a
larger supply of materials to build virions.
Thought Question

6.11 What kinds of questions about viruses can be addressed
in tissue culture, and what questions require infection of an
animal model?

Plaque Isolation and Assay
of Bacteriophages

For the investigation of cellular microbes, an important
tool is the culturing of individual colonies on a solid substrate that prevents dispersal throughout the medium, as
described in Chapters 1 and 4. Plate culture of colonies
enables us to isolate a population of microbes descended
from a common progenitor. But viruses cannot be isolated
as “colonies.” The reason is that although viruses can be
obtained at incredibly high concentrations, they disperse in
suspension. Even on a solid medium, viruses never form a
solid visible mass comparable to the mass of cells that constitutes a cellular colony.
In viral plate culture, viruses from a single progenitor lyse their surrounding host cells, forming a clear area
called a plaque. Each plaque arises from a single infected
bacterium that bursts, its phage particles diffusing to
infect neighboring cells. To perform a plaque assay of
bacteriophages, a diluted suspension of phages is mixed
with bacterial cells in soft agar, and the mixture is then
poured over a nutrient agar plate (Fig. 6.38). Where no
bacteriophages are present, the bacteria grow homogeneously as a “lawn,” an opaque sheet over the surface
(confluent growth). Where there is a bacteriophage, it
infects a cell, replicates, and spreads progeny phages to
adjacent cells, killing them as well (Fig. 6.39). The loss
of cells results in a round, clear area seemingly cut out of
the bacterial lawn. Plaques can be counted and used to
calculate the concentration of phage particles, or plaqueforming units (PFUs), in a given suspension of liquid
culture. The liquid culture can be analyzed by serial dilution in the same way one would analyze a suspension of
bacteria.

GENES AND GENOMES

How does a bacterium organize and replicate its genome?
As shown in the Current Research Highlight, Dr. Rodrigo
Reyes-Lamothe and his collaborator, professor Marcelo
Tolmasky (Fig. 7.1), found that plasmids and chromosomes, by and large, occupy different spaces in the cell.
This segregation makes sense if the organism is to replicate
and make RNA efficiently without entangling components
of its genome. Compartmentalizing bacterial chromosomes
and plasmids is one form of genome organization. Are
there others?
The question of bacterial chromosome organization was
first raised in the mid-twentieth century after one of our
intestinal bacteria became the focus of efforts to understand
genes and genetics. In one remarkable experiment, a cell
of E. coli was lysed, releasing its chromosome for electron
microscopy. What spewed out of this single cell was a strand
of DNA 1,500 times longer than E. coli itself (Fig. 7.2 ).
Scientists wondered how this enormous molecule could fit
into a single cell, and how an enzyme could duplicate that
much DNA (more than 4.6 million base pairs) without the
whole DNA molecule getting tangled up. And how did it
manage to do this in under 20 minutes, the doubling time
of the organism? Over half a century later, those questions
continue to intrigue us.
In this chapter we discuss the structure and organization of prokaryotic genomes, as well as the mechanisms
for their replication. We examine how microbial enzymes
that manipulate DNA were used to develop techniques
such as DNA sequencing and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We also introduce the concept of information
flow—namely, how information stored in DNA gets passed
to
new
generations
and becomes protein.
DNA replication copies the information held
in a DNA sequence and
makes a new DNA molecule passed to offspring.
Transcription converts
DNA information into
a “readable” form called
RNA. Translation then
“reads” the information
in RNA to make protein.

7.1

DNA: The Genetic Material

Where do genetic traits come from, and how are they
passed from one generation to the next? The ability of
plants and animals to transfer genetic traits was known
well before we knew that DNA was the carrier of genetic
information. Early researchers understood the Mendelian
model of gene inheritance and how it dictated the passage
of traits from parent to offspring in eukaryotes—a gene
transmission mechanism known as vertical gene transfer.
Bacteria, however, appeared to operate differently, because
in addition to vertical gene transfer, bacteria showed horizontal gene transfer, the movement of genetic information from one cell into another. The study of horizontal
gene transfer in bacteria ultimately led to the discovery of
horizontal transfer throughout animals and plants. Relative to bacteria, however, animals and plants horizontally
transfer DNA on a much slower timescale because of their
longer generation times. Mechanisms of horizontal gene
transfer are discussed in Chapter 9.

CHAPTER 7

Our path to understanding DNA began in 1928 when
Frederick Griffith (1879–1941) discovered that he could
kill mice with live but seemingly harmless (avirulent)
Streptococcus pneumoniae, but only if he coinjected the
mice with dead cells from a virulent strain of the bacteria. Something from the dead bacteria transformed the
innocuous live bacteria into killers. This form of horizontal gene transfer, called transformation, led to the discovery in 1944 that genetic information is embedded in
the base sequence of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (see
Section 1.6). Another example of transformation is the
toxic shock gene that can be moved horizontally among
strains of Staphylococcus aureus. As a result of these and
many other experiments, we now appreciate that chromosomes are made of contiguous packets of information,
called genes.
Genes are units of information composed of a sequence
of DNA nucleotides of four different types: adenine (A),
guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C). (For a review
at the level of introductory biology, see eAppendix 1.)
A structural gene is a string of nucleotides that can be
decoded by an enzyme to produce a functional RNA molecule. A structural gene usually produces an RNA molecule
that in turn encodes a protein. A DNA control sequence,
on the other hand, regulates the expression of a structural
gene. DNA control sequences do not encode RNA or protein (so they are not considered genes), but they do regulate
RNA production from an adjacent structural gene. Control sequences include promoters that launch RNA synthesis from a structural gene, and binding sites for regulatory
proteins that can activate or inactivate that promoter.
As noted previously, the entire genetic complement of
DNA in a cell that defines it as an organism is called its
genome. Our primary goal in Chapter 7 is to convey how
genomes are maintained and replicated. Mining the informational content of DNA sequences and genes is described
more fully in Chapters 8 and 10.

Bacterial Genomes

In the early twentieth century, the chromosomes of bacteria, unlike those of eukaryotes, could not be observed by
light microscopy. The reason is that bacteria, unlike eukaryotes, do not undergo mitosis, a process in which chromosomes condense and thicken about a thousandfold, making
them visible with light microscopy. Important clues to bacterial chromosome structure were gleaned, however, from
painstaking genetic studies. In the 1950s it was discovered
that conjugation (see Section 9.1), a horizontal gene transfer mechanism requiring cell-to-cell contact, could transfer large segments of some bacterial chromosomes—not all
at once, as in the established Mendelian model of plants
and animals, but sequentially over a period of time (it takes



GENOMES AND CHROMOSOMES



237

100 minutes to move the entire E. coli chromosome from
one cell to another).
Thus, even though the bacterial chromosome could not
be seen, conjugation allowed genes to be mapped relative
to each other according to time of transfer. For example,
a donor strain that can synthesize the amino acids alanine
and proline can directly transfer the encoding genes to a
recipient cell defective in those genes. The transfer process is nonspecific, so any gene can be transferred in this
way. Completion of transfer also requires recombination,
in which the donor DNA fragment replaces the recipient
DNA fragment. Successful transfer of the genes for amino
acid synthesis enables the formerly defective recipient to
form colonies on minimal media lacking either amino acid.
Because chromosome transfer takes time and starts from a
fixed point, not all genes are transferred simultaneously. It
might take one gene 10 minutes of cell contact to be transferred, while the second gene, farther away from the starting point of DNA transfer, takes an additional 20 minutes.
Because eukaryotic chromosomes are linear, scientists
initially expected that bacterial chromosomes would be linear too. However, the early genetic maps drawn from conjugation experiments just would not fit together in a manner
consistent with a linear model—for the simple reason that
the bacterial chromosome in E. coli, the organism under
study at the time, is circular. We now know that most bacteria and archaea have circular chromosomes. Some species,
however, have linear chromosomes, or even a mix of linear
and circular chromosomes. Examples include the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi, and the plant tumor agent
Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Table 7.1).
The size range of genomes across the phylogenetic tree,
from viruses to humans, is enormous. Generally speaking,
the simpler the organism, the smaller its genome. At some
point, as DNA content is trimmed, the organism loses
independence and lives only if it has parasitized another
organism. For examples, see the evolution of mitochondria
and chloroplasts (Section 17.6) and obligate intracellular
pathogens (Chapter 23).

To Summarize








A genome is all of the genetic information that defines
an organism.
Genomes of bacteria and archaea are made up of chromosomes and plasmids consisting of DNA.
Chromosomes of bacteria and archaea can be circular
or linear, as can plasmids.
Functional units of DNA sequences include structural
genes and regulatory sequences.

Genome Organization

Do microbial genomes differ in structure or functional
organization? New techniques for constructing physical
maps of genomes and determining the sequences of whole
genomes have revealed tremendous diversity in the size and
organization of prokaryotic genomes.

Genomes Vary in Size

Bacterial and archaeal chromosomes range in size from
approximately 130 to 14,000 kilobase pairs (kb). For comparison, eukaryotic chromosomes range from 2,900 kb

(Microsporidia) to over 100,000,000 kb (flowering plants).
The human genome is over 3,000,000 kb.

Note:

The designation “kb” can refer to the length of a doublestranded or single-stranded DNA molecule. A bacterial genome
is, by definition, double-stranded. Some viral genomes can be
single-stranded.

One of the smallest cellular genomes sequenced thus
far is that of Mycoplasma genitalium. These pathogens rely
on their host environment for many products but can still
grow outside a host cell. The complete genome of M. genitalium consists of only 580 kb and encodes 480 proteins.

CHAPTER 7

It lacks the genes required for many biosynthetic functions,
including the synthesis of amino acids, the construction of
cell walls, and a functional tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
In contrast, free-living bacteria that can grow in soil have
larger genomes and dedicate many genes to the synthesis
or acquisition of amino acids or TCA cycle intermediates.
Even different strains of one species, such as Salmonella
enterica, may vary considerably in gene distribution.
Figure 7.3 illustrates genes of Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium (abbreviated S. Typhimurium) transcribed in
the clockwise direction (outer circle) and the counterclockwise direction (inner circle), which means that they are
transcribed off of opposite strands of DNA. The color coding of different genes indicates presence in S. Typhimurium
versus other Salmonella species and seven additional members of the family Enterobacteriaceae. For example, genes
marked orange are present in all eight species, while those
marked blue are present only in S. Typhimurium.
Another feature that distinguishes bacterial and archaeal
genomes from those of eukaryotes is the amount of so-called
noncoding DNA (DNA that does not encode proteins).
Many, but not all, eukaryotes contain huge amounts of noncoding DNA scattered between genes. In some species (such
as humans), over 90% of the total DNA is noncoding. Some

noncoding regions include enhancer sequences needed
to drive transcription of eukaryotic promoters and DNA
expanses that separate enhancers. Enhancer sequences can
function at large distances from the gene they regulate. A
promoter is the DNA sequence immediately in front of,
and sometimes within, a gene needed to activate the gene’s
expression. Most of the noncoding spacers appear to be remnants of genes lost over the course of evolution and pieces
of defunct viral genomes. Noncoding regions, however, may
provide raw material for future evolution.
In contrast to many eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea
tend to have very little noncoding DNA (typically less than
15% of the genome). Archaeal genomes do, however, contain a few genes with internal noncoding DNA sequences
that resemble the introns of eukaryotes.

Functional Units of Genes

In the simplest case, a gene can operate independently of
other genes. The RNA produced from a single gene is said
to be “monocistronic,” which means it codes for one protein. Alternatively, a gene may exist in tandem with other
genes in a unit called an operon (Fig. 7.4A). All genes in
an operon are situated head to tail on the chromosome and

front of the first gene. The single RNA molecule produced
from the operon contains all the information from all the
genes in that operon and is called “polycistronic.”
On a functional level, a collection of genes and operons at
different positions on the chromosome form a regulon when
they have a unified biochemical purpose (such as amino acid
biosynthesis) and are regulated by the same regulatory protein
(Fig. 7.4B). The various mechanisms regulating expression
of these functional genetic units are discussed in Chapter 10.

In bacteria, the names of genes are given as a threeletter abbreviation of the encoded enzyme’s name (for example,
the gene dam encodes deoxyadenosine methylase) or the function of related genes (for example, genes designated proA, proB,
and proC encode enzymes involved in proline biosynthesis). Bacterial gene names are written in Italics with lowercase letters. For
example, the genes involved in catabolizing lactose are the lac
genes. If several genes are involved in the pathway, a fourth letter,
capitalized, is used. Thus, the three genes lacZ, lacY, and lacA are
all associated with lactose catabolism. When speaking of a gene
product, a nonItalic (roman) font is used, and the first letter is
capitalized. Thus, lacZ is the gene and LacZ is the protein product
of that gene.

DNA Function Depends on
Its Chemical Structure

DNA is composed of four different nucleotides linked
by a phosphodiester backbone (Fig. 7.5A). Each nucleotide consists of a nucleobase (also called a nitrogenous base) attached through a ring nitrogen to carbon
1 of 2-deoxyribose in the phosphodiester backbone. The
2-deoxy position that distinguishes DNA from RNA
(Fig. 7.5B) is highlighted in the figure. A phosphodiester
bond (also marked in Fig. 7.5A) joins adjacent deoxyribose
molecules in DNA to form the phosphodiester backbone.
Phosphodiester bonds link the 3′ carbon of one ribose to
the 5′ carbon of the next ribose. The two backbones are
antiparallel so that at either end of the DNA molecule, one
DNA strand ends with a 3′ hydroxyl group and the complementary strand ends with a 5′ phosphate. This antiparallel
arrangement is necessary so that complementary bases protruding from the two strands can pair properly via hydrogen bonding. Base pairing is not possible if DNA strands
are modeled in a parallel arrangement.
The nucleobases in DNA are planar heteroaromatic
structures arranged perpendicular to the phosphodiester
backbone and parallel to each other like a stack of coins.
Purines (bicyclic nucleobases: adenine or guanine) pair with
pyrimidines (monocyclic nucleobases: thymine or cytosine). Under physiological conditions of salt (about 0.85%
NaCl) and pH (pH 7.8), the hydrogen bonding of the bases
permits adenine to pair only with thymine (via two hydrogen bonds) and likewise guanine with cytosine (via three
hydrogen bonds). These complementary base interactions
enable the two phosphodiester backbones to wrap around
each other to form the classic double helix, or duplex.
The thousands of H-bonds that form between purines and
pyrimidines along the interior of a DNA duplex (Fig. 7.5)
make the bonding of the two complementary strands of
DNA highly specific, so that a duplex forms only between
complementary strands. Although H-bonds govern the specificity of strand pairing, the thermal stability of the helix is
due predominantly to the stacking of the hydrophobic base
pairs. Stacking of base pairs allows water and ions to interact
with the hydrophilic, negatively charged phosphate backbone
of DNA while avoiding the hydrophobic interior of the helix.
The stacking of DNA bases also appears to permit DNA to
act as a “wire” capable of conducting electrons over long distances. The conduction of electrons along DNA may be sensed
by certain proteins bound to DNA (discussed in Chapter 9).

In the space-filling model of DNA in Figure 7.6A and
the contour map in Figure 7.6B, notice that the DNA
double helix has grooves: a wide major groove and a narrower minor groove. The two grooves are generated by the
angles at which the paired bases meet each other. These
grooves provide DNA-binding proteins access to base
sequences buried in the center of the molecule, so that the
proteins can interact with the bases without the strands
being separated. Figure 7.7 shows an example of an important DNA-binding protein, DtxR of Corynebacterium

diphtheriae, the cause of diphtheria. The DtxR dimer (pair
of subunits) binds the major groove of DNA at the promoter for the diphtheria toxin gene (dtxA). Toxin expression is repressed when iron concentrations are high, which
signals to the bacteria that they are in an environment outside a human host. Gene regulation is discussed further in
Chapter 10.
At high temperatures (50°C–90°C), the hydrogen
bonds in DNA break and the duplex falls apart, or denatures, into two single strands. The temperature required
to denature a DNA molecule depends on the GC/AT ratio
of a sequence. More energy is required to break the three
H-bonds of a GC base pair than the two H-bonds of an
AT base pair. Thus, DNA with a high GC content requires
a higher denaturing temperature than does similar-sized
DNA with a lower GC content. The black center ring in
Figure 7.3 illustrates how the GC content of bases can
change around a single chromosome.
When DNA has been heated to the point of strand separation, lowering the temperature permits the two single
strands to find each other and reanneal into a stable double helix. The kinetics of DNA renaturation is much slower
than that of denaturation, because renaturation is a random, hit-or-miss process of complementary sequences finding each other. This melting/reannealing property of DNA
is exploited in a number of molecular techniques (see the
discussion of the polymerase chain reaction in Section 7.6).
Note, however, that bacteria and archaea growing at
extreme pH or temperature protect their DNA from denaturation through the use of remarkable DNA-binding proteins such as the archaeal histone proteins Hmf and Htz.
The role of DNA-binding proteins in microbial survival is
the subject of considerable research.

Thought Question

7.2 How do the kinetics of denaturation and renaturation
depend on DNA concentration?

RNA Differs Slightly from DNA

Why do cells make both RNA and DNA? As we learned in
Chapter 3, DNA and RNA have different missions. The cell
uses DNA to stably archive the information needed to make
a functional cell. The growing cell continually accesses this
information by making temporary copies of its genes in the
form of RNA (ribonucleic acid) molecules that direct the
synthesis of proteins. The cell also makes small RNA molecules that adjust information flow by modulating DNA
gene expression. To keep their roles separate, DNA and
RNA must have slightly different structures.

DNA in a cell is usually double-stranded, whereas RNA
is usually single-stranded. DNA and RNA are chemically similar, except that in RNA the sugar ribose replaces
deoxyribose and the pyrimidine base uracil replaces thymine (see Fig. 7.5B). Functionally, these two differences
prevent enzymes meant to work on DNA, such as DNA
polymerases, from acting on RNA. They also prevent RNA
nucleases (RNases) from degrading DNA. However, uracil
can still base-pair with adenine, which means that hybrid
RNA-DNA double-stranded molecules can form (hybridize) when base sequences are complementary. In fact, this
hybridization is a necessary step in the decoding of genes
to make proteins.
Although RNA molecules are commonly thought of as
single-stranded, all RNA molecules in nature have RNARNA double-stranded regions called “hairpins.” Hairpin
structures form when complementary nucleotide sequences
within the primary RNA sequence bend back and hybridize. These double-stranded hairpins have a variety of biological functions.

Bacterial Chromosomes Are
Compacted into a Nucleoid

The chromosome of E. coli has over 4.6 million bases in
one strand, or over 9 million, counting both strands. This
is a huge molecule. At the normal pH of the cell (7.8), all
the phosphates in the backbone (all 9 million of them) are
unprotonated and negatively charged, so this one molecule contributes greatly to the overall negative charge of
the cytoplasm.
Figure 7.2 shows DNA spewing out of a damaged bacterial cell. Laid out, the chromosome is 1,500 times longer than the cell. It is obvious from this photomicrograph
that an intact, healthy cell must compact a huge bundle of
DNA into a very small volume. DNA is the second-largest molecule in the cell (only peptidoglycan is larger) and
comprises a large portion of a bacterial cell’s dry mass,
about 3%–4%. Although packaging 3% of a cell’s dry weight
may not seem like a challenge, realize that DNA is further
confined only to ribosome-free areas of the cell, so the
chromosome-packing density reaches about 15 mg/ml. In
a test tube, DNA at 15 mg/ml is almost a gel, so how can
anything move inside a cell? And how does all this DNA
keep from getting hopelessly tangled?
As introduced in Chapter 3, cells pack their DNA into
a manageable form that still allows ready access to DNAbinding proteins. Although bacteria lack a nuclear membrane, they pack their DNA into a series of protein-bound
domains collectively called the nucleoid (see Section 3.4).
Unlike the compact nucleus of eukaryotes, the bacterial
nucleoid is distributed throughout the cytoplasm.

DNA Supercoiling Compacts
the Chromosome

A nucleoid gently released from E. coli appears as 30–100
tightly wound loops (Fig. 7.8 ). The boundaries of each
loop are defined by anchoring proteins called histone-like
proteins for their similarity to histones, the DNA-binding
proteins of eukaryotes. The double helix within each
domain is itself helical, or supercoiled. The easiest way to
envision supercoiling is to picture a coiled telephone cord.
After much use, a phone cord twists, or supercoils, upon
itself. Supercoiled phone cords are quite compact, taking
up less space than a relaxed cord. Circular DNA works
the same way—a property used by the cell to pack its
chromosome.
Note that DNA cannot form supercoils unless its ends
are tethered. In a circular chromosome, the DNA ends are
tethered to each other. Introducing an extra twist by breaking one or both strands, twisting one end, and then resealing the strands means that the increased, or decreased,
torsional (twisting) stress is trapped in the final circular
molecule. It cannot then spontaneously unwind.
Remarkably, the nucleoid with its 30–100 loops (or
“domains”) can maintain different loops at different superhelical densities. The independence of supercoiled domains
was demonstrated by introducing one single-strand
nick in the phosphodiester backbone of one domain (see
Fig. 7.8). You can do this by adding very small amounts
of a nuclease (an enzyme that cleaves a nucleic acid). The
ends of the broken strand, driven by the energy inherent
in the supercoil, rotate about the unbroken complementary strand of the duplex and relax the supercoil. A single
nick in a genome, however, removes supercoils from only
one domain. How is this possible if the chromosome is one
circular molecule? The unaffected chromosomal domains

PART 2



GENES AND GENOMES

supercoiling enzyme makes a double-strand break at one
point in the circle, passes another part of the DNA through
the break, and reseals it. The result is the same as if one end
of the broken circle were twisted one full turn.
To put this in context, most DNA in nature is righthanded. Right-handed, helical DNA turns clockwise when
you look down the length of the double strand. Now think
of a right-handed helical phone cord. Twist the cord so
as to decrease the number of helix twists (underwinding
the cord). As you keep underwinding, the torsional stress
of removing clockwise helical twists is relieved when the
phone cord (or DNA) flips around itself (supercoils) in a
clockwise rotation. Because the DNA is underwound, the
compensatory supercoil is called a negative supercoil. Overwinding a clockwise helix (like DNA) introduces additional
clockwise helical twists; the stress of which is relieved by
the DNA supercoiling in a counterclockwise direction.
Because the DNA helix is overwound, the compensatory
supercoil is called a positive supercoil.
The nucleoids of bacteria and most archaea, as well as
the nuclear DNA of eukaryotes, are kept negatively supercoiled. Because the DNA is underwound, the two strands
of negatively supercoiled DNA are easier to separate than
those of positively supercoiled DNA. This is important for
transcription enzymes, such as RNA polymerase, that must
separate strands of DNA to make RNA.
Note, however, that some archaeal species living in
acid at high temperature have nucleoids that are positively
supercoiled to keep DNA double-stranded in these inhospitable environments (discussed next). Positively supercoiled

DNA is harder to denature, because it takes excess energy
to separate overwound DNA.

Topoisomerases Supercoil DNA

Supercoiling changes the topology of DNA. Topology is
a description of how spatial features of an object are connected to each other. Thus, enzymes that change DNA
supercoiling are called topoisomerases. To maintain
proper DNA supercoiling levels, a cell must delicately balance the activities of two types of topoisomerases. Type I
topoisomerases are typically single proteins that cleave only
one strand of a double helix, while type II enzymes have
multiple subunits that cleave both strands of a DNA molecule. Type I enzymes relieve or unwind supercoils. As
, topoisomerase I cleaves one
shown in Figure 7.10
strand of a negatively supercoiled double helix and holds on
to both ends of the break. The release of intrinsic energy
allows the enzyme to pass the intact strand through the
break and re-ligate the strand, which reintroduces a helical turn. The molecule is released with one less negative
supercoil.
The action of DNA gyrase is more involved
(Fig. 7.11 ). DNA gyrase is an example of a type II topoisomerase whose function is to introduce negative supercoils
in DNA (see Fig. 7.11A). The active gyrase complex is a
tetramer composed of two GyrA and two GyrB proteins.
The gyrase B subunits first grab a section of the double
helix. Then GyrA, in an ATP-dependent process catalyzed by GyrB, introduces a double-strand break, passes a

Enzymes that make or manage bacterial DNA, RNA,

instance, the quinolone antibiotics specifically target bacterial type II topoisomerases. They do not affect eukaryotic topoisomerases. A modern quinolone, ciprofloxacin,
was the treatment of choice for anthrax pneumonia during the 2001 anthrax attacks. The progenitors of this
drug family, nalidixic and oxolinic acids, were used to
map gyrA and gyrB, the first drug resistance genes identified in E. coli. The modern successors of these drugs, the

fluoroquinolones, are among the most widely used antimicrobials in the world. These drugs do not block topoisomerase action but stabilize the complex in which DNA gyrase
is covalently attached to DNA (see Fig. 7.11). The stuck
complex forms a physical barrier in front of the DNA replication complex, and the bacterial cell dies.
Extreme thermophiles (hyperthermophilic archaea) possess an unusual gyrase called reverse DNA gyrase. In contrast to the DNA gyrase from mesophiles, reverse gyrase
introduces positive supercoils into the chromosome. It is
proposed that tightening the coil helps protect the chromosome against thermal denaturation. Because the DNA
has extra turns, it takes more energy (heat) to separate
the strands.

Thought Questions

7.3 DNA gyrase is essential to cell viability. Why, then, are
nalidixic acid–resistant cells that contain mutations in gyrA
still viable?
7.4 Bacterial cells contain many enzymes that can degrade

linear DNA. How, then, do linear chromosomes in organisms
like Borrelia burgdorferi (the causative agent in Lyme disease)
avoid degradation?

involves over 20 proteins coming together in a complex
machine. Operation of the replication complex is all the
more remarkable, considering that some bacteria, such as
thermophilic Bacillus species that live in hot springs, can
double their population in less than 15 minutes.
The molecular details of bacterial DNA replication are
important to understand because they provide targets for
new antibiotics and tools for biotechnology, such as the
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (see Section 7.6). In addition, the bacterial proteins of DNA repair have homologs
in the human genome, defects in which produce inherited
human diseases, such as xeroderma pigmentosum, that predispose the carrier to certain cancers.

To Summarize












Noncoding DNA can constitute a large amount of a
eukaryotic genome, while prokaryotes have very little
noncoding DNA.
DNA is composed of two antiparallel chains of purine
and pyrimidine nucleotides in which phosphate links the
5′ carbon of one nucleotide with the 3′ carbon of the
next in the chain. The result is a double helix containing
a deep major groove and a more shallow minor groove.
Hydrogen bonding and interactions between the
stacked bases hold together complementary strands
of DNA.
Supercoiling by topoisomerases compacts DNA into an
organized nucleoid.

Overview of Bacterial DNA Replication

To replicate a molecule containing millions of base pairs
poses formidable challenges. How does replication begin
and end? How is accuracy checked and maintained?

Bacteria, eukaryotes, and most archaea possess negatively supercoiled DNA. Archaea living in extreme
environments have positively supercoiled genomes.

Semiconservative replication. Replication

of cellular
DNA is semiconservative, meaning that each daughter
cell receives one parental strand and one newly synthesized
strand (Fig. 7.12). At the replication fork, the advancing
DNA synthesis machine separates the parental strands while
extending the new, growing strands. The semiconservative
mechanism provides a means for each daughter duplex to be
checked for accuracy against its parental strand.
Enzymes that synthesize DNA or RNA can connect
nucleotides only in a 5′-to-3′ direction. That is, every newly
made strand begins with a 5′ triphosphate and ends with
a 3′ hydroxyl group (see Fig. 7.5). A polymerase (a chainlengthening enzyme complex) fastens the 5′ alpha-phosphate of an incoming nucleoside triphosphate to the 3′
hydroxyl end of the growing chain, thus forming a phosphodiester bond. (The alpha-phosphate is the phosphate
closest to the sugar.) This 5′-to-3′ enzymatic constraint
produces an interesting mechanistic puzzle: If polymerases

DNA Replication

How do bacteria replicate their DNA quickly and minimize
errors? Quick and accurate replication of DNA can help
a microorganism grow and compete with other species.
Replication efficiency is one reason why bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella can cause disease so quickly after
ingestion. In this respect, bacteria differ from multicellular organisms, which need to regulate cell division carefully
within their tissues because unregulated growth within
tissues leads to cancer. The process of bacterial replication

no problem, because it is synthesized in a 5′-to-3′ direction
toward the fork, but synthesizing the other new strand in a
5′-to-3′ direction would seem to dictate that it move away
from the fork (Fig. 7.13). How is this possible?

Thought Question

7.5 Suppose you can label DNA in a bacterium by growing
cells in medium containing either 14N nitrogen or the heavier
isotope, 15N; you can isolate pure DNA from the organism; and
you can subject DNA to centrifugation in a cesium chloride
solution, a solution that forms a density gradient when subjected to centrifugal force, thereby separating the light (14N)
and heavy (15N) forms of DNA to different locations in the test
tube. Given these capabilities, how might you prove that DNA
replication is semiconservative?

The process of DNA replication is divided into three
phases: (1) initiation, which is the melting (unwinding) of
the helix and the loading of the DNA polymerase enzyme
complex; (2) elongation, which is the sequential addition
of deoxyribonucleotides to a growing DNA chain, followed by proofreading; and finally (3) termination, in
which the DNA duplex is completely duplicated, the negative supercoils are restored, and key sequences of new
DNA are methylated.
Replication from a single origin. Replication in bacteria
begins at a single defi ned DNA sequence called the origin (oriC). Following initiation, a circular bacterial chromosome replicates bidirectionally (in both directions away
from the origin; see Fig. 7.13, step 1) until it terminates
at defi ned termination (ter) sites located on the opposite
side of the molecule. Once the process has begun, the cell
is committed to completing a full round of DNA synthesis. As a result, the decision of when to start copying the
genome is critical. If it starts too soon, the cell accumulates unneeded chromosome copies; if it starts too late, the
dividing cell’s septum “guillotines” the chromosome, killing both daughter cells. Consequently, elaborate fail-safe
mechanisms link the initiation of DNA replication with cell
mass, generation time, and cellular health, making the timing of initiation remarkably precise.

Note:

Some single-celled microbes have chromosomes with
more than one origin. The archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, for
instance, has a single chromosome with three replication origins.

Initiation of DNA replication.

CHAPTER 7
Fundamentals of DNA replication. The basic process of

chromosome replication is outlined in Figure 7.13. After
initiation of replication, a replication bubble forms at the
origin. The bubble contains two replication forks that
move in opposite directions around the chromosome
(Fig. 7.13, step 2). DNA polymerases synthesize DNA in
a 5′-to-3′ direction. At each fork, therefore, one new DNA
strand can be synthesized continuously until the terminus
region (step 3). However, because the two DNA strands
are antiparallel and the DNA polymerases synthesize only
5′ to 3′, the other daughter strand has to be synthesized
discontinuously, in stages—seemingly backward relative to
the moving fork (step 4). The fragments of DNA formed on
this discontinuously synthesized strand are called Okazaki
fragments, after the Japanese scientists, Reiji and Tsuneko
Okazaki, who discovered them. As we will discuss later, the
Okazaki fragments are progressively stitched together to
make a continuous, unbroken strand. Ultimately, the two
replicating forks meet at the terminal sequence (step 5), and
the two daughter chromosomes separate.
Overall, copying the entire chromosome in E. coli takes
about 40 minutes. Chromosome-partitioning processes
then move each chromosome to different ends of the cell
so that a cell wall can form at midcell (the cell “equator”).
Once the cell wall is complete (the amount of time varies
but is generally about 20 minutes), the two daughter cells,
with their new chromosomes, can separate. So you might
imagine the whole process from the start of replication to
cell separation would take about 60 minutes for E. coli. But
when nutrients are plentiful, E. coli can divide in 20 minutes. How is this possible? As we saw in Chapter 3, the
answer is that in fast-growing cells, a partially replicated
chromosome can begin new rounds of replication even
before the first round is complete.
Now let’s examine each step in molecular detail to
answer some important questions about this mechanism.



GENOMES AND CHROMOSOMES



249

to prevent ill-timed initiations (before the cell has grown
enough to divide again).
How does SeqA know to bind just after the origin has
replicated? The key is DNA methylation. E. coli uses the
enzyme deoxyadenosine methylase (Dam) to attach a methyl
group to the N-6 position of adenine in the sequence GATC
(in Fig. 7.5A, see the N of the NH 2 group attached to the
six-membered ring). GATC sequences are scattered along
the chromosome on both strands. Just after the origin has
replicated, there is a short lag before the newly synthesized
strand is methylated by Dam methylase. As a result, the origin is temporarily hemimethylated—a situation in which
only one of the two complementary strands is methylated.
Because SeqA has a high affinity for hemimethylated origins, this inhibitor will bind most tightly immediately after
the origin has been replicated. Thus bound, SeqA will prevent another initiation event. Eventually, the Dam methylase
will methylate the new strand and decrease SeqA binding.
The replication initiator protein, DnaA. Timing of initia-

tion is determined by the concentration of the replication
initiator protein DnaA complexed with ATP (DnaA-ATP).
DnaA-ATP recognizes specific 9-bp repeats at oriC. As the
cell grows, the level of active DnaA-ATP rises until it is sufficient to bind to these repeats (Fig. 7.14, step 1). Binding of DnaA to the origin facilitates melting of DNA and
initiates the assembly of a membrane-attached replication
hyperstructure (the replisome), a complex of numerous
proteins that come together and bind at oriC.
After it is replicated, the origin cannot trigger another
round of replication for two reasons: inhibition by SeqA
and decreasing levels of unbound DnaA-ATP. Another
round of replication can begin only after (1) the origin
becomes fully methylated, (2) SeqA dissociates, and (3) the
DnaA-ATP concentration rises.
What happens to new replication origins after replication
begins? Figure 7.15 reveals that, even though the origin

What determines when replication begins? Initiation is
controlled by DNA methylation, and by the binding of
a specific initiator protein to the origin sequence. Further molecular events load the elaborate DNA polymerase
complex and generate the first RNA primer for the new
DNA strand. Figure 7.14
presents an overview of the
initiation process.

DNA methylation controls timing. The E. coli origin of

replication (oriC) is a 245-base-pair sequence. Initiation
of replication at oriC is activated by one protein, DnaA,
and inhibited by another, SeqA. Immediately after a cell
has divided, the level of active DnaA (DnaA bound to
ATP) is low, and the inhibitor protein SeqA binds to oriC

GENES AND GENOMES

Initiation requires RNA polymerases. An unexpected
feature of DNA replication is that its initiation actually
requires two RNA polymerases. The fi rst is the housekeeping RNA polymerase used to make most of the RNA in the
cell (discussed in Chapter 8). The second is the DNA primase (discussed shortly).
The housekeeping RNA polymerase transcribes DNA
at oriC, which helps separate the two DNA strands
(Fig. 7.14, step 2; this RNA polymerase is not shown).
Strand separation at oriC allows a special DNA helicase
(DnaB), in association with a DNA helicase loader (DnaC),
to bind the two replication forks formed during initiation
(step 3). DnaC facilitates proper placement of DNA helicase
at the fork, and then it disengages and leaves.
The DnaB helicase uses energy from ATP hydrolysis to unwind the DNA helix before DNA moves into the
DNA polymerase replicating complex. The ringlike DnaB
is assembled around one DNA strand at each replication
fork. After loading DnaB at the origin, DnaC is released
(Fig. 7.14, step 4). As the DNA unwinds, small singlestranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs, seen in Fig. 7.17)
coat the exposed single-stranded DNA, protecting it from
nucleases patrolling the cell and preventing re-formation
of double-stranded DNA. The origin is almost ready to
receive DNA polymerase.
DNA-dependent DNA polymerases possess the unique
ability to “read” the nucleotide sequence of a DNA template
and synthesize a complementary DNA strand. The discovery of this activity earned Arthur Kornberg (1918–2007)
(Fig. 7.16) the 1959 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. However, as remarkable as these enzymes are, no DNA
polymerase can start synthesizing DNA unless there is a preexisting DNA or RNA fragment to extend—that is, a primer
fragment. The primer fragment possesses a 3′ OH end that
receives incoming deoxyribonucleotides. Consequently,
once the helicase DnaB is bound to DNA, the next step is to
make RNA primers at each fork (Fig. 7.14, step 5). In contrast to DNA polymerases, RNA polymerases can synthesize RNA without a primer. The RNA polymerase required
for DNA replication is called DNA primase (DnaG). Primase synthesizes short (10–12 nucleotides) RNA primers at
the origin that can launch DNA replication. One primase is
loaded at each of the two replication forks.
Why do DNA polymerases require RNA primers? RNA
primers probably remain from when all life was RNA
based—an exciting model of molecular evolution, discussed in Chapter 17.

starts in the center of the cell, the newly replicated origins
(green fluorescence) move toward opposite cell poles. Moving origins toward the cell poles is part of the partitioning
mechanism that gets chromosomes out of harm’s way before
the division septum forms at midcell (described below).

FIGURE 7.16  Arthur Kornberg and Sylvy Kornberg, circa
1960. A biochemist in her own right, Sylvy Kornberg contributed in
the effort to purify DNA polymerase I.

A sliding clamp tethers DNA polymerase to DNA. At this

point, the DNA is almost ready for DNA polymerase. But
fi rst a sliding clamp protein (the beta subunit of DNA
polymerase III) must be loaded to keep the DNA polymerase affi xed to the DNA (Fig. 7.14, step 6). Without
this clamp, DNA polymerase would frequently “fall off”
the DNA molecule (see eTopic 7.1). A multisubunit complex
(called the clamp-loading complex) places the beta clamp,
along with an attached pair of DNA polymerase molecules,
onto DNA. DNA polymerase (specifically DNA Pol III,
discussed later) then binds to the 3′ OH terminus of the
primer RNA molecule and begins to synthesize new DNA
(step 7). The molecular structure of the beta clamp loaded
onto DNA is shown in eTopic 7.1.

Elongation of Replicating DNA

Escherichia coli contains five different DNA polymerase
proteins, designated Pol I through Pol V. All DNA polymerases catalyze the synthesis of DNA in the 5′-to-3′ direction. However, only Pol III and Pol I participate directly
in chromosome replication. The other polymerases conduct
operations to rescue stalled replication forks and repair
DNA damage.
DNA polymerase III. The main replication polymerase,

Pol III, is a complex, multicomponent enzyme. Pol III was
another discovery by Arthur Kornberg. The DNA synthesis
activity of Pol III is held in the alpha subunit of the complex, while other subunits are used for improving fidelity
(accuracy of replication) and processivity (a measure of how
long the polymerase remains attached to, and replicates, a

CHAPTER 7

template). The Pol III epsilon subunit (DnaQ), for example, contains a proofreading activity that corrects mistakes
and improves fidelity.
Proofreading activities within DNA polymerases scan
for mispaired bases that have been mistakenly added to a
growing chain. A mispaired base is more mobile than the
correct base in a DNA molecule because a mispaired base
does not properly hydrogen-bond to the template base. This
motion halts DNA elongation by Pol III because the base is
not properly positioned at the enzyme’s active site. Stalling
of Pol III activity triggers an intrinsic 3′-to-5′ exonuclease
activity in the epsilon subunit. Exonucleases degrade DNA
starting from either the 5′ end or the 3′ end, depending on
the enzyme. The exonuclease activity of Pol III cleaves the
phosphodiester bond, releasing the improperly paired base
from the growing chain. Once the wayward base has been
excised, Pol III can resume elongation.
Both DNA strands are elongated simultaneously. After

initiation, each replication fork contains one elongating
5′-to-3′ strand, called the “leading strand” (look back
at Fig. 7.14, step 7). But how is the opposite strand at
each fork replicated? There are no known DNA polymerases capable of synthesizing DNA in the 3′-to-5′ direction, which would seem to be needed if both strands are
to be synthesized simultaneously. DNA synthesis of one
strand continuing all the way back to the origin is not a
solution, because it would leave the unreplicated strand
at each fork exposed to possible degradation for too long
and would double the time needed to complete DNA
replication.
The cell has solved this dilemma by coordinating the
activity of two DNA Pol III enzymes in one complex—
one for each strand. The two associated Pol III complexes, together with DNA primase and helicase, form
the replisome. As the dsDNA unwinds at the fork, the
problem strand loops out and primase (DnaG) synthesizes a primer. The second Pol III enzyme binds to the
primed section of the loop and synthesizes DNA in the
5′-to-3′ direction (imagine the lower template strand in
Figure 7.17 threading from left to right, through the
polymerase ring). All the while, the second polymerase
moves with the first polymerase (on the leading strand)
toward the fork (Fig. 7.17, step 1). Recent evidence indicates that the two E. coli replisomes move along DNA
toward opposite poles of the cell, but generally stay within
the middle third of the cell. They eventually meet again at
the terminator located at midcell.
Note that simultaneous extension of the two strands at
a single fork requires that synthesis of the looped strand
must lag behind synthesis of the leading strand and that
new RNA primers must be synthesized by DNA primase (DnaG) every 1,000 bases or so. Thus, the lagging



GENOMES AND CHROMOSOMES



251

strand is synthesized discontinuously, in pieces called Okazaki fragments, while the leading strand can be synthesized continuously. As the leading strand moves forward,
advancing the fork, there remains a long stretch of lagging
strand complementary to the already replicated leading
strand. This lagging strand is single-stranded but protected by single-stranded DNA-binding proteins (SSBs)
(Fig. 7.17, step 2). After about 1,000 bases, DNA primase reenters and synthesizes a new RNA primer in anticipation of lagging-strand DNA synthesis (step 3). At some
point, the lagging-strand polymerase bumps into the 5′
end of the previously synthesized fragment. This interaction causes DNA polymerase to disengage from that strand
(step 4), and the clamp loader loads a new clamp near the
new RNA primer (step 5). The DNA polymerase binds to
that clamp and begins synthesizing another Okazaki fragment (step 6). This process repeats every 1,000 bases or so
around the chromosome.
The model just presented assumes that the replisome
contains two DNA polymerase III molecules. However,
the replisome actually consists of three polymerases—one
on the leading strand and two on the lagging strand. The
second polymerase on the lagging strand comes into play
only when a large gap of unreplicated DNA remains on the
lagging strand. For simplicity, the third polymerase is not
included in the model shown in Figure 7.17.
DNA polymerase I. Discontinuous DNA synthesis results in

a daughter strand containing long stretches of DNA punctuated by tiny patches of RNA primers. This RNA must
be replaced with DNA to maintain chromosome integrity.
To remove the RNA, cells typically use the 5′-to-3′ exonuclease activity of Pol I or an RNase enzyme specific for
RNA-DNA hybrid molecules (called RNase H). A DNA
Pol I enzyme then synthesizes a DNA patch using the 3′
OH end of the preexisting DNA fragment as a priming site
(Fig. 7.18). When DNA Pol I reaches the next fragment,
the enzyme removes the 5′ nucleotide and resynthesizes
it. This process of replicating DNA increases accuracy and
decreases mutations.
Once DNA Pol I stops synthesizing, it cannot join the
3′ OH of the last added nucleotide with the 5′ phosphate
of the abutting fragment. The resulting nick in the phosphodiester backbone is repaired by DNA ligase, which in
E. coli and many other bacteria uses energy gained by cleaving nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to form the
phosphodiester bond (see Fig. 7.18). NAD is not used in
its usual way, as a reductant that oxidizes substrates. Energy
inherent in the diphosphate bond of NAD is captured upon
cleavage by DNA ligase and used to re-join the 3′ OH and
5′ phosphate ends present at the nick. DNA ligase from
eukaryotes and some other microbes use ATP rather than
NAD in this capacity.

result, the DNA ahead of the fork twists, introducing positive supercoils. (Try this yourself: Twist two pieces of string
together, staple one end of the duplex to a piece of cardboard, and then pull the two strands apart from the free
end. Notice the supercoiling that takes place beyond, or
downstream of, the moving fork.) The increasing torsional
stress in the chromosome could stop replication by making strand separation more and more difficult. What prevents the buildup of torsional stress is the DNA gyrase
(see Fig. 7.11) that is located ahead of the fork, removing
the positive supercoils as they form.

while the other set halts DNA polymerases replicating counterclockwise relative to the origin. A protein

During and immediately after replication, the cell is
faced with what could be called “knotty” problems. The
first develops as soon as replication begins. Replicated
DNA molecules occasionally form knots between homologous genes on sister chromosomes, holding them together.
These knots must be removed before sister chromosomes
can segregate to opposite cell poles. Resolving these knots
requires the enzyme topoisomerase IV, a type II topoisomerase similar to DNA gyrase. Topo IV activity is stimulated by SeqA, the protein that binds to newly replicated,
hemimethylated DNA. Recall that SeqA also prevents
reinitiation at newly replicated origins. This one protein,
therefore, prevents the start of a premature round of replication and removes topological constraints to chromosome
segregation.
The second “knotty” problem is encountered when a
chromosome finishes replicating. Because of the topology of the chromosome, the two daughter molecules will
appear as a catenane, a pair of linked rings. The rings must
be unlinked so that sister chromosomes can segregate at
termination (Fig. 7.19B). The bacterial cell uses proteins
called XerC and XerD to unlink these rings. XerCD recognizes a specific site (called dif ) on both DNA molecules and
catalyzes a series of cutting and re-joining steps that essentially pass one molecule through the other. Once the two
daughter chromosomes have resolved and move toward the
poles, the cell can begin to divide, forming the cell septum.
A mutant bacterium defective in XerC or D will have difficulty dividing (Fig. 7.20).
Once replicated, how do sister chromosomes move to
opposite poles of a bacterial cell? In some species, such as
Bacillus subtilis, a mechanical segregation system consisting of the proteins ParA and ParB and the DNA-binding site parS pulls the chromosomes toward different ends
of the cell. E. coli, however, does not possess a parABS
system for segregating sister chromosomes. It seems that
the process of replication itself, which takes place mostly

in the middle third of the cell (see Fig. 3.29), propels E.
coli chromosomes toward opposite cell poles. The terminator region remains in the center of the cell until
after it is replicated. The replicating chromosome, then,
takes on the appearance of a butterfly with its wings
outstretched toward either cell pole. This configuration
places the genome in a vulnerable position. A bacterial cell
must avoid making a cell division septum too early or
risk slicing through its still-replicating chromosomes.
How bacteria prevent this disaster is discussed in Special
Topic 7.1.

ate replication at different times (asynchronous replication).
However, depriving the population of a required amino acid
can synchronize reproduction of the population. Ongoing
rounds of DNA synthesis finish, but new rounds do not begin.
Replication stops until the amino acid is once again added to
the medium—an action that triggers simultaneous initiation
in all cells. Why does this synchronization of reproduction
happen?

7.9 The antibiotic rifampin inhibits transcription by RNA
polymerase, but not by primase (DnaG). What happens to DNA
synthesis if rifampin is added to a synchronous culture?

cell division. Caulobacter replicates by producing a motile cell at

one end of a nonmotile, fixed, stalked cell. The photomicrograph
shows cells of a xerD mutant. The middle cell is elongated with
multiple constrictions because of the xerD defect in chromosomal
segregation. Even though Topo IV is present in the xerD mutant,
both mechanisms are needed to ensure that linked replicating chromosomes always clear the division plane. Source: R. B. Jensen. 2006.





Replication is semiconservative, with newly synthesized strands lengthening in a 5′-to-3′ direction. Replication consists of initiation, elongation, and termination
steps.
Replication is initiated from a fixed DNA origin
attached to the cell membrane. Initiation depends on
the mass and size of the growing cell. It is controlled by
the accumulation of initiator and repressor proteins and
by methylation at the origin.
Elongation requires that primase (DnaG) must lay
down an RNA primer, DNA polymerase III must act
as a dimer at each replication fork, and a sliding clamp
must keep DNA Pol III attached to the template DNA
molecule.
The 3′-to-5′ proofreading activity of Pol III corrects
accidental errors during polymerization.
DNA ligase joins Okazaki fragments in the lagging
strand.
Two replisomes, each containing a pair of DNA
Pol III complexes, move along the DNA in E. coli.
Termination involves stopping replication forks halfway
around the chromosome at ter sites that inhibit helicase
(DnaB) activity.
Ringed catenanes formed at the completion of replication are separated by the proteins XerC and XerD.

7.4

Plasmids

Two kinds of extragenomic DNA molecules can interact
with bacterial genomes: horizontally transferred plasmids
and the genomes of bacteriophages (viruses that infect
bacterial cells). Plasmid-encoded functions can contribute to the physiology of the cell (for example, antibiotic
resistance). In some cases, the plasmid or phage DNA
will integrate into the bacterial genome (see Section 9.2).
Eukaryotic genomes and the genomes of eukaryotespecific plasmids and viruses also share proteins and
undergo chromosomal interactions, such as insertions of
viral DNA into the host chromosome. Viruses of eukaryotes and their applications in genetic engineering are discussed in greater detail in Chapters 11 and 12. In this
section we discuss aspects of plasmid replication. Discussion of bacteriophage replication can be found in Chapter 6 and eTopic 7.2.

GENES AND GENOMES

SPECIAL TOPIC 7.1& & Nucleoid Occlusion Factors and the Septal “Guillotine”
During bacterial cell division, it is crucial that sister chromosomes dodge the septum forming at midcell. Segregation proteins, such as topoisomerase IV (ParC) in Escherichia, work
to untangle replicated sister chromosomes so that they can
move away from midcell toward the safety of opposite cell
poles. But because replication and segregation take time, it
is equally important for a cell to prevent septal formation as
long as replicating chromosomes occupy midcell. If cell division starts too early, the growing septum could slice through
(“guillotine”) a replicating chromosome, killing the cell. Bacteria such as E. coli and Bacillus subtilis use nucleoid exclusion
proteins to prevent septal guillotining of chromosomes. The
protein in E. coli is called SlmA.
How does SlmA work? Recent evidence by Shishen Du
and Joe Lutkenhaus at the University of Kansas Medical Center sheds new light on the mechanism. Recall from Chapter
3 that before a septum can form at midcell, a protein called
FtsZ must polymerize to form a ring around the circumference of the membrane. However, SlmA can bind to chromosomal DNA and prevent FtsZ polymerization and, thus,
septum formation. Figure 1 shows in vitro evidence for this
inhibition. FtsZ in solution will form long, rod-like polymers,
but not in the presence of SlmA molecules bound to SlmA

the proteins used for plasmid replication are actually host

enzymes. Which host proteins are used depends on the

two directions simultaneously. Rolling-circle replication
(Fig. 7.22
) is unidirectional. In rolling-circle replication, a replication initiator (RepA, encoded by a plasmid gene) binds to the origin of replication and nicks one
strand. RepA holds on to one end (5′ PO 4) of the nicked
strand, while the other end (3′ OH) serves as a primer for
host DNA polymerase to replicate the intact, complementary strand. The RepA initiator protein recruits a helicase
that unwinds DNA, which becomes coated by singlestranded DNA-binding proteins. As replication proceeds, the nicked strand progressively peels off without
replicating, until the strand is completely displaced. Then
the two ends of the displaced but nicked single strand
are re-joined by the RepA protein and released. The single-stranded circular molecule is protected by host single-stranded DNA-binding proteins until host enzymes
replicate a complementary strand and regenerate a doublestranded molecule. Although most known plasmids use

only one of the two replication strategies (bidirectional or

the circumstance of the cell.

Plasmid “Tricks” Ensure Inheritance

daughter cells inherit the plasmid? In some instances, the
answer is yes (see the Current Research Highlight). Some
plasmids make many copies of themselves before the bacterial cell divides. These are called high-copy-number plasmids and can attain 50–700 copies per cell, depending on
the plasmid. As a result, there is a high probability that
both daughter cells will, by random chance, contain at
least one plasmid.
Not all plasmids are high-copy-number, however.
Low-copy-number plasmids limit how many copies they
make to avoid draining the cell of energy. Cells forced to
waste energy making many plasmid copies could be at a
growth disadvantage when competing with plasmid-less
cells in a natural environment. Low-copy-number plasmids evolved clever partitioning systems that ensure both
daughter cells will contain copies of the plasmid. Figure 7.23 illustrates a model for how one type of partitioning works for plasmid R1, a Salmonella plasmid that
imparts multidrug antibiotic resistance to host bacteria. The process employs three known plasmid-encoded
genes: parC, parM, and parR. The parC DNA sequence

is analogous to the centromere of eukaryotic chromosomes. The DNA-binding protein ParR binds to the
parC sequence and forms a ParR-parC plasmid complex.
ParM protein is an actin-like molecule that forms long
filaments as it hydrolyzes ATP. The ParM filaments are
dynamically unstable, constantly elongating and shortening. However, each end of a ParM actin-like filament
can bind to a ParR-parC plasmid complex. When both
ends of a ParM filament contact ParR-parC plasmid complexes, the filament stabilizes and elongates until the two
plasmids hit the opposite poles of the cell. The plasmid
is thus dislodged from the filament, and the filament
quickly dissociates.
Some plasmids ensure their inheritance by carrying
genes whose functions benefit the host bacterium under
certain conditions. For instance, bacterial plasmids can
carry genes that confer antibiotic resistance (discussed in
Figure 7.21B and Chapter 27). As long as the antibiotic
is present in the environment, any cell that loses the plasmid will be killed or stop growing. Antibiotic resistance
plasmids benefit bacteria, but they are a major problem

260

GENES AND GENOMES

for modern hospitals, where plasmids carrying multiple
drug resistance genes are transmitted from harmless bacteria into pathogens. On the other hand, plasmids (such as
pBR322) containing drug resistance genes are the workhorses of genetic technology and have benefited society
tremendously.
Other kinds of host survival genes carried by plasmids
include genes providing resistance to toxic metals, genes
encoding toxins that aid pathogenesis, and genes encoding
proteins that enable symbiosis. These are discussed in later
chapters. Most of the genes involved in the nitrogen-fixing
symbiosis of Rhizobium, for example, are plasmid-borne.
Far from being freeloaders, plasmids often contribute significantly to the physiology of an organism.
Some plasmids, however, use what could be called
“strong-arm measures” to ensure their maintenance. These
plasmids come equipped with self-preservation genes,
called “addiction modules,” that force the host cell to keep
the plasmid or die (eTopic 7.3).

Plasmids Are Transmitted between Cells

Plasmids have played a pivotal role in evolution because
of how easily they can be passed back and forth between
bacterial species. This is particularly evident today in the
spread of antibiotic resistance, whose genetic basis is often
a plasmid-encoded gene.
Some plasmids are self-transferable via conjugation,
a process that requires cell-to-cell contact to move the
plasmid from a donor cell to a recipient (as discussed in
Section 9.1). Other plasmids are incapable of conjugation
(nontransmissible). A third group can be transferred only
if a self-transferable plasmid resides in the same cell. In this
case, the conjugation mechanism produced by one plasmid will act on the other plasmid. Any plasmid released
from dead cells can also be taken up intact by some bacteria in a process called transformation (see Section 9.1).
Finally, plasmids can be transmitted in nature by accidentally being packaged into bacteriophage head coats—in
other words, by bacteriophage transduction (also covered
in Section 9.1).

To Summarize






Plasmids are autonomously replicating circular or linear DNA molecules that are part of a cell’s genome.
Plasmids replicate by rolling-circle and/or bidirectional
mechanisms.
Plasmids can be transferred between cells.

7.5

Eukaryotic and
Archaeal Chromosomes

The chromosomes of eukaryotic microbes such as protists
and algae have much in common with those of prokaryotes.
Both consist of double-stranded DNA, for example, and
both usually replicate bidirectionally. Nevertheless, important differences exist as well, particularly in genome structure. Eukaryotic chromosomes are linear and contained
within a nucleus, and their replication involves mitosis
(reviewed in eAppendix 2). Archaeal chromosomes, similar to bacterial chromosomes, are circular and lack a nuclear
membrane, but archaeal proteins involved in transcription
and replication appear more eukaryotic than bacterial.

Eukaryotic Genomes Are
Large and Linear

Overall, the genomes of eukaryotic nuclei are larger than
those of bacteria, sometimes by several orders of magnitude. For example, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae genomes are 12,052 kb and 800 kb,
respectively. Eukaryotes typically have duplicate copies of
multiple chromosomes (diploid number ranges between
10 and 100). All eukaryotic chromosomes are linear,
whereas many, if not most, bacterial chromosomes are
circular. Eukaryotic chromosomes use mitosis to replicate and segregate to daughter cells (see Appendix 1).
Each eukaryotic chromosome has numerous origins of
replication that collectively generate hundreds of replication bubbles, although not all of them “fire” during each
replication cycle. Termination zones essential to bacterial
chromosomes are not found in eukaryotes.
The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes, called telomeres,
have a special problem replicating. Because their chromosomes are linear, eukaryotes cannot replicate their 3′ ends
using DNA-dependent DNA polymerase. The result is that
the 5′ ends of a chromosome (the result of lagging-strand
synthesis) are always shorter than 3′ ends. Left like this,
chromosomes would become progressively shorter and
genetic information would be lost. The solution to this
problem is an enzyme complex called telomerase. Telomerase is actually a reverse transcriptase that reads RNA as
a template to synthesize DNA. Telomerase uses an intrinsic RNA (an RNA that is part of the enzyme) as a template
to add numerous DNA repeat sequences to the 3′ ends of
chromosomes. Extension of the 3′ end by telomerase will
permit synthesis of the RNA primer necessary to replicate
the 5′ end of the chromosome. The process prevents the
loss of genetic information during division.

CHAPTER 7

Telomerase may have evolved from the ancient progenitor
cells that contained RNA rather than DNA genomes (see
Section 17.2). The reverse transcriptase may also be the
evolutionary source of retroviruses (see eTopic 6.1).

Note:

Bacteria with linear chromosomes do not have telomerases. How do they replicate their 3′ ends? Some cap the ends of
their chromosomes with covalently bound terminal proteins that
prime DNA replication (Streptomyces). Others form covalently
closed hairpin ends (essentially making one long, circular, singlestranded molecule). The ends appear to recombine after being replicated (Borrelia).

Unlike prokaryotic cells, eukaryotic cells pack their
DNA within the confines of a nucleus where a series of proteins called histones compact the DNA. Histones are rich
in arginine and lysine, so they are positively charged, basic
proteins that easily bind to the negatively charged DNA.
The DNA becomes wrapped around the histones to form
units called nucleosomes. Histones also play a regulatory
role through methylation and acetylation. Bacteria, too,
have DNA-packaging proteins, but they are more diverse
and less essential for function (see Sections 3.4 and 7.2).
The detailed structures of the genomes of eukaryotes
and prokaryotes reveal surprising differences (Fig. 7.24).
The genome of the bacterium E. coli is packed with genes
(green in the figure) encoding proteins or RNA molecules. These genes are separated by very little unused
or noncoding DNA (purple), and by only an occasional
mobile element, such as an insertion sequence, that can
move from one DNA molecule to another. Most prokaryotic genes are organized in coordinately regulated,
multiple-gene operons. In contrast, 98% of the human
genome consists of noncoding sequences (sequences that
do not encode proteins). Noncoding sequences include



GENOMES AND CHROMOSOMES



261

sequences that regulate protein-coding genes; genes
that encode untranslated, small regulatory RNAs; and
the fossil genomes of ancient viruses. Coding genes are
separated by large stretches of noncoding sequences and
usually are not clustered together in operons. Moreover, coding genes in the human genome are interrupted by introns (DNA within a gene that is not part
of the coding sequence for a protein, shown as yellow
in Fig. 7.24) and ancient gene duplications that have
decayed into nonfunctional, vestigial pseudogenes. Bacteria also have pseudogenes, but they account for much
less of the genome than in eukaryotes. The more rapid
replication of bacteria causes pseudogenes to be lost more
quickly.

Note:

Pseudogenes differ from noncoding DNA in that at least
part of a pseudogene’s sequence is similar to that of a gene with a
known function. Also note that some pseudogenes express mRNA,
but the proteins produced have no obvious function.

By themselves, promoters of eukaryotic genes have very
low activity and require enhancer DNA sequences to drive
transcriptional activity. Enhancer sequences act at long distances from promoters, and scientists suspect that once
enhancers became important, it was necessary to place
enough DNA between them to reduce the activation of
other, unrelated but adjacent promoters.

Archaeal Genomes Combine Features
of Bacteria and Eukaryotes

All characterized archaea have a single circular chromosome
and polygenic operons; and, like bacteria, their reproduction is predominantly asexual. Archaea are true prokaryotes

because their cells lack a nuclear membrane, but the structures of the DNA-packing proteins, RNA polymerase,
and ribosomal components more closely resemble those
of eukaryotes. Figure 7.25 compares the core RNA polymerase (RNAP) subunits of the archaeon Sulfolobus to
those of the eukaryotic RNA polymerase II (RNAPII).
The archaeal TATA-binding protein (TBP, green) and
transcription factor B (TFB, pink) also show homology
to eukaryotic counterparts that help position and activate
RNAPII at some eukaryotic promoters. One consequence
of eukaryotic-like transcription and translation in archaea
is that archaea are resistant to antibacterial antibiotics that
target those processes.
Oddly, these organisms have two different types of
DNA polymerase: one similar to those of eukaryotes and
the other unique to archaea. The archaeal origin of the
replication sequence also shows greater similarity to those
of eukaryotes. Finally, it should be noted that archaeal
genomes encode certain unique components, such as
the metabolic pathway of methanogenesis. (For more on
archaea, see Chapter 19.)
What experimental data allow us to make such comparisons? Overwhelmingly, we rely on new data from the
growing number of microbial genomes sequenced (over
30,000 as of 2015). Comparison of genomes has revolutionized our understanding of evolutionary relationships
among microbes.
We will now examine the tools of DNA sequence analysis that have made these studies possible. The most important of these tools—restriction mapping, DNA sequencing,
and amplification by the polymerase chain reaction—actually harness the molecular apparatus used by bacteria to
replicate or protect their own chromosomes.

To Summarize










Eukaryotic chromosomes are always linear, doublestranded DNA molecules that replicate by mitosis.
A reverse transcriptase called telomerase is needed to
finish replicating the ends of a eukaryotic chromosome.
Histones (eukaryotic DNA-packing proteins) play a critical role in forming chromosomes.
Introns and pseudogenes are noncoding DNA
sequences that make up a large portion of eukaryotic
chromosomes.
Archaeal chromosomes resemble those of bacteria in
size and shape, but archaeal DNA polymerases are more
closely related to eukaryotic enzymes.

DNA Sequence Analysis

How do we study a genome? We have just described the
core concepts of DNA structure, packaging, and replication. This knowledge is crucial to understanding genomics
and the fundamentals of genomic analysis. But what about
the basic techniques used to manipulate DNA? These
include isolating genomic DNA from cells, snipping out
DNA fragments with surgical precision, splicing them into
plasmid vehicles, and reading their nucleotide sequences.
These are the techniques that drive the genomic revolution.

DNA Isolation and Purification

reliable purification methods can be used to isolate it.

7.10 Figure 7.26B illustrates how agarose gels separate DNA
molecules. If you ran a highly supercoiled plasmid in one lane
of the gel and the same plasmid with one phosphodiester
bond cut in another lane, where would the two molecules end
up relative to each other in this type of gel?

Cloning. How did scientists ever conceive of cloning a

gene from one organism into the DNA of an unrelated
organism? The beginning of the recombinant DNA revolution can be traced to 1972. Scientists knew that many
restriction endonucleases generate cohesive ends and that
some plasmids contain a single site for certain restriction

went unrecognized until Stanley Cohen (Fig. 7.27A),
Herb Boyer (Fig. 7.27B), and Stanley Falkow were relaxing together after a scientific meeting in 1972. They
suddenly realized that a piece of DNA cut from one organism’s chromosome could be grafted to a plasmid cut with

CHAPTER 7

the same restriction endonuclease (Fig. 7.27C). They
also knew that DNA ligase (see Fig. 7.18) would seal the
fragment to the plasmid and form a new artificial DNA
molecule. They hypothesized that the recombinant plasmid could be introduced into E. coli and replicated. Three
months later, the strategy, called cloning, worked. This
seminal work was published by Boyer and Cohen along
with students Annie Chang and Robert Helling. Over the
next decade, the technique became known as “gene cloning,” an immensely powerful technology that thrust biology into the genomic era.
For many years, scientists used the restriction endonuclease strategy discovered by Boyer, Cohen, Chang, and
Helling to randomly generate genome libraries containing all the genes in an organism’s chromosome. Today,
new approaches can more efficiently probe the microbial genome. A microbe’s entire genome can now be
sequenced within a few days—a process that once took
years. Once obtained, the sequence can be analyzed using
bioinformatics, a computer-assisted process that predicts
the beginnings and ends of genes, determines the amino
acid sequences of gene-encoded proteins, and forecasts
probable functions for those proteins (Chapter 8 describes
bioinformatics in more detail). Interesting genes can then
be amplified using PCR (described later) and cloned into
plasmids using restriction endonucleases. The cloned gene
can be reintroduced into mutant or wild-type organisms
using various techniques and the effects on physiology or
pathogenicity determined.

Thought Question

7.11 Given that E. coli possesses restriction endonucleases
that cleave DNA from other species, how is it possible to clone
a gene from one organism to another without the cloned gene
sequence being degraded?

FIGURE 7.28

Imagine having the ability to amplify one copy of a gene
into millions more within one or two hours. The technique,
called the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has revolutionized biological research, medicine, and forensic analysis.
The PCR technique, outlined in Figure 7.28, requires the
design of specific oligonucleotide primers (usually between
20 and 30 bp) that anneal to known DNA sequences flanking the DNA you want to amplify. A thermostable DNA
polymerase uses these primers to replicate the target DNA.
Heat-stable DNA polymerases are used because the PCR
reaction mixture must undergo repeated cycles of heating to
95°C (to separate DNA strands so that they are available for
primer annealing), cooling to 55°C (to allow primer annealing), and heating to 72°C (the optimum reaction temperature for the polymerase). The polymerase Taq, from the
thermophile Thermus aquaticus, was originally used for this
purpose, but polymerases from other thermophiles are also
used. Because PCR reactions require 25–30 heating and
cooling cycles, a machine called a thermocycler is used to
reproducibly and rapidly deliver these cycles. It is important
to realize that PCR technology emerged from studies of a
seemingly obscure class of microorganisms: extremophiles.
This basic PCR technique has been modified to serve
many purposes. Primers can be engineered to contain specific restriction sites that simplify subsequent cloning, as
described already. If the primers used for PCR are highly
specific for a gene that is present in only one microorganism, PCR can be used to detect the presence of that organism in a complex environment, such as the presence of the
pathogen E. coli O157:H7 in hamburger. Multiplex PCR,
involving several primer sets, can be used to detect multiple
pathogens in a single reaction (see eAppendix 3).
PCR has also profoundly changed our judicial system by
making it possible to amplify the tiniest amounts of DNA

base for the natural one, at which point the chain stops
growing. The result is a population of DNA strands of
varying length, each one truncated at a different adenine
position. How the tagged fragments are used to determine sequence is described in eAppendix 3. The Sanger
method has been replaced by even more rapid techniques,
all of which include an element of the Sanger chain
termination approach.

Next-Generation Sequencing

The old way of sequencing genomes was to randomly clone
DNA fragments into plasmid or phage vectors and then
separately sequence each fragment. It took months, if not
years, to sequence an entire genome. Today, new sequencing technologies, called “next-generation sequencing,”
have combined the power of robotics, computers, and fluidics such that an entire bacterial genome can be sequenced
within days.
One of these techniques, pyrosequencing, is described
in eTopic 7.5. The most used technique today is called
sequencing by synthesis (a technology developed by Solexa,
a company now part of Illumina, Inc.); the Illumina process is outlined in Figure 7.30. Basically, the genome to
be sequenced is sonically fragmented into 100- to 300-bp
segments, and different linker oligonucleotides are ligated
to each end (Fig. 7.30, steps 1 and 2). Small fragments
are used because the technique can sequence only 100–
300 bp from any one fragment. Strands of each fragment
are then separated and the mixture added to an optical
flow cell. The fragments, millions of them, are randomly
fixed to the solid surface (step 3). Each individual fragment sticks to a different area of the cell. The glass surface
also has a dense lawn of oligonucleotides fixed at their 5′
ends to the glass surface. These oligonucleotides are complementary to the fragment linker ends but do not hybridize to them at this point.



GENOMES AND CHROMOSOMES



267

Next, each single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) fragment is
converted into a tight cluster of identical fragments through
a series of so-called bridge amplifications (Fig. 7.30, steps
4 and 5). Ends of each fragment anneal to nearby matched
oligos (fixed to the glass surface), which then serve as primers to amplify the fragments further. Multiple amplifications result in millions of different ssDNA fragment clusters
dotting each lane of each slide (step 6).
All clusters are simultaneously sequenced in a repetitive series of single-step, reversible chain termination reactions that attach fluorescently labeled nucleotides one at a
time to the clusters (Fig. 7.30, steps 7 and 8). Because each
individual cluster is a tuft of identical DNA molecules, all
of the molecules in that cluster will have the same tagged
base added and will fluoresce the same color. Note that the
sequence of either strand can be determined by adding one
or the other primer. After a base is added, a snapshot captures the colors, which reveal the bases added to each cluster (step 9). Next, the fluorescent marker (fluor) is removed
from the growing chain, which also reverses chain termination, and the slide is again flooded with tagged bases (step
10). Snapshots taken after each sequencing round sequentially capture the fluorescent colors of each cluster as each
base is added.
The old Sanger dideoxy method could sequence 1,000
bp per template but required considerable time, effort,
and space to do so. In contrast, each flow-cell lane in the
sequencing-by-synthesis technique produces 10–120 million DNA fragments, thus generating up to 600 gigabases (Gb) of DNA sequence per run (1 Gb = 1 billion
bases). Each read is short (about 100 bases per template),
but because millions of templates are read, the massively
parallel sequencing yields hundreds of millions of bases.
Computer programs then find the overlaps among the
millions of sequence results and assemble them into the
sequence of the entire chromosome. With this technology, you can have your own genome sequenced for less
than $1,000.

GENES AND GENOMES

How the information from sequences is mined is discussed further in Chapter 8. Many important discoveries
have resulted from this technology. A particularly intriguing discovery was finding that the entire genome of the bacterium Wolbachia (which infects 20% of the world’s insect
population) is embedded within the genome of Drosophila,
the common fruit fly. The evolutionary implications of this
discovery are under intense investigation.

Microbiomes and Metagenomics

Microorganisms in nature do not generally exist as pure
cultures. They grow instead as complex consortia containing numerous species (microbiomes), most of which have
never been grown in a laboratory. With newer and everfaster DNA sequencing methodologies and PCR techniques, we can now “peer” deeper into the natural world.
Like the explorers of old, scientists are finding new species never before seen and are beginning to understand the
intricate ways bacterial species interact to form what could
be called biological support groups.
Metagenomics, a term coined in 1998 by microbiologist Jo Handelsman (Yale University), is the use of modern genomic techniques to study microbial communities
directly in their natural environments, bypassing the need
for isolating and cultivating individual species in the laboratory. The field began with the culture-independent retrieval
of 16S rRNA genes from the environment by amplifying
DNA directly from environmental samples using PCR protocols. Since genes encoding 16S rRNA from small ribosomal subunits (also called small-subunit rRNA) are highly
conserved, it is possible to determine whether a given
sequence of 16S rRNA represented a new species and to
which known species it was most closely related. Since then,
metagenomics has revolutionized microbiology by shifting
the focus even further away from cultivatable organisms
toward the estimated 99% of microbial species that cannot be cultivated. Since 2003, hundreds of metagenomic
projects have been carried out or are ongoing. Examples
of the metagenomic analysis of ecosystems are presented in
Chapter 21.
Identifying membership of a microbiome can be very
informative but says little about the genetic and metabolic potential of the community. Randomly sequencing
DNA from a microbiome, however, will identify most, if
not all, of the genes present in all the organisms that the
consortium comprises. All of these genes make up what
is known as the metagenome—that is, the combined
yet unsorted genomic potential of all the organisms in
the sample. Thus, metagenomics not only identifies the
principal partners of a microbial consortium, but also
reveals many of their metabolic capabilities. Communities of microorganisms can actually form new metabolic

pathways in which a useless by-product of one member can be used by another member in a reaction whose
product can benefit a third member.
Metagenomic analysis has also been used to explore
how a microbiome might expand the ecological niche
of some eukaryotic microbes. One intriguing study
recently identified the bacterial microbiome of the Antarctic marine protozoan Euplotes focardii, a strictly psychrophilic ciliate isolated from Terra Nova Bay. This
organism will not survive above 10°C. Sandra Pucciarelli and colleagues from the University of Camerino,
Italy, discovered that E. focardii “cured” of their bacterial microbiota by antibiotics had difficulty growing at
4°C (Fig. 7.31). Using Illumina DNA sequencing, the
scientists analyzed the 16S rR NA sequences present in
E. focardii DNA extracts. The data revealed that most
bacterial species were either from Gammaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, or Bacteroidetes. When
protein-encoding sequences were examined, many were
homologous to ice-binding or antifreeze proteins found
in other cold-adapted bacterial species (Section 5.2).
The researchers conclude that one or more members
of the bacterial consortium have an important role in
facilitating growth of this Antarctic protozoan at low
temperatures.
The science of metagenomics has even progressed to a
point where the genome of a single cell can be sequenced—a
process called single-cell genomics (SCG). SCG requires special protocols, equipment, and reagents to isolate a single cell
from an environment and, without ever growing it, extract

genome using tiny molecular machines. One
machine (RNA polymerase) reads the DNA template to make RNA (transcription). Another machine
(the ribosome) decodes the RNA to assemble a protein (translation). Once made, each polypeptide must
fold properly and somehow find its correct cellular or
extracellular location. Proteins that have outlived their
usefulness must be destroyed and their amino acids
recycled. In Chapter 8 we explain how the cell makes
proteins and guides their fate. What emerges is a picture of remarkable biomolecular integration, controlled

Molecular coupling. Transcription by RNA polymerase
(RNAP), and translation by ribosomes make protein. Bacteria couple these processes so that ribosomes can make
protein even while RNAP is transcribing the RNA. For some
genes coupling requires a protein to link the ribosome to a
transcribing RNAP. RfaH, for instance, simultaneously binds
RNAP and ribosomal protein S10. Irina Artsimovitch and Paul
RÖsch found that once RfaH binds to RNA polymerase, a
major domain of RfaH dramatically refolds to expose an S10
binding site. RfaH then couples the ribosome to RNAP and
prevents premature termination of transcription.

GENES AND GENOMES

Today we know a great deal about transcription and translation. The Current Research Highlight, for instance,
illustrates how Irina Artsimovitch, Paul Rösch, and Monali NandyMazumdar (Fig. 8.1) exposed a mechanism by
which these processes are coupled in bacteria. But how
did the journey begin? By 1960 we knew that the DNA
in a cell holds the genetic code, but the code itself and
how the code produces protein remained mysterious.
RNA was a suspected, but unproven, intermediate until
Marshall Nirenberg and his postdoctoral student Heinrich Matthaei at the National Institutes of Health (Fig.
8.2A) designed a cell-free system (a cell lysate of E. coli)
to test the RNA hypothesis. They used RNA molecules,
synthesized by Maxine Singer (Fig. 8.2B), that contained
simple, known, repeated sequences, such as poly-A (consisting only of adenylic acid), poly-U (polyuridylic acid),
poly-AAU, and poly-ACAC. These RNA molecules were
tested to see whether the repetitive sequence might direct
incorporation of a specific amino acid into a protein. Each
synthetic polynucleotide was tested in the presence of a
radiolabeled amino acid. If the radioactive amino acid was
incorporated into a polypeptide, the polypeptide would
also be radioactive. On the morning of May 27, 1960, the
results of experiment 27Q showed that the poly-U RNA
specified the assembly of radioactive polyphenylalanine.
It was the first break in the genetic code. For his work,
Nirenberg, along with Har Gobind Khorana (who developed methods for making synthetic nucleic acids) and
Robert Holley (who solved the structure of yeast transfer RNA), won the 1968 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine.
In Chapter 8 we explore the way microbes, primarily
bacteria, interpret the information held within a nucleotide sequence of DNA and convert that information into a
string of amino acids—a protein. From there we look
at what the cell does
with those proteins
once they are made.
For instance, specific
proteins are moved
into the periplasm,
while other proteins
must be inserted into

8.1

RNA Polymerases
and Sigma Factors

To survive and reproduce, every cell needs to access information encoded within DNA. How does this happen?
Chromosomal DNA is large and cumbersome, so the first
step in the process is to make multiple copies of the information in snippets of RNA that can move around the cell
and, like disposable photocopies, can be destroyed once the
encoded protein is no longer needed. This copying of DNA
to RNA is called transcription.

CHAPTER 8



TRANSCRIPTION, TRANSLATION, AND BIOINFORMATICS

RNA Polymerase Transcribes
DNA to RNA

An enzyme complex called RNA polymerase, also known
as DNA-dependent RNA polymerase, carries out transcription, making RNA copies (called transcripts) of a
DNA template. The DNA template strand specifies the
base sequence of the new complementary strand of RNA.
RNA polymerase in bacteria consists of a core polymerase and a sigma factor. Core polymerase contains the
proteins required to elongate an RNA chain. Sigma factor
is a protein needed only for initiation of RNA synthesis,
not for its elongation. Together, core polymerase plus sigma
factor are called the holoenzyme.
A single core RNA polymerase is a complex of four different subunits: two alpha (α) subunits, one beta (β) subunit,
and one beta-prime (β′) subunit (Fig. 8.3). A fifth subunit,
omega (ω), is shown in the figure but is not required for
transcription. The beta-prime subunit houses the Mg2+-containing catalytic site for RNA synthesis, as well as sites for
the rNTP (ribonucleoside triphosphate, or ribonucleotide)
substrates, the DNA substrates, and the RNA products. The
3D structure of RNA polymerase shows that DNA fits into a
cleft formed by the beta and beta-prime subunits (Fig. 8.3).
The alpha subunit assembles the other two subunits (β and
β′) into a functional complex. It also communicates through
physical “touch” with various regulatory proteins that can
bind DNA. These protein-protein interactions inform RNA
polymerase what to do after binding DNA.

The composition of RNA polymerase and the sequences
of its subunits are well conserved among the Bacteria. However, differences in function are notable when examining this
enzyme from organisms living in extreme environments.
Pseudomonas syringae strain Lz4W, for example, is a Gram
negative, Antarctic soil species that grows at 0°C. RNA polymerase from E. coli does not function at that temperature.
M. K. Ray and colleagues from the Centre for Cellular and
Molecular Biology in India extracted RNA polymerase from
P. syringae and found that it did function in vitro at 0°C. The
optimum temperature was 37°C but the enzyme retained
10%–15% activity at 0°C, enough so it could live and grow.
Sigma factors. Where does a gene begin and end? The helical structure of a DNA sequence appears largely homogeneous, making it hard to distinguish one area from another.
In fact, core RNA polymerase randomly binds and transcribes DNA, “blind” to where a gene starts. Some random
transcript generation may be useful (see Chapter 17), but
totally random transcription initiation would be extremely
wasteful. Consequently, there must be a mechanism to tell
RNA polymerase where a real gene starts.
Sigma (σ) factors are the proteins that guide RNA polymerase to the beginnings of genes (Fig. 8.3). Similar to how a
visually impaired person uses touch to identify the beginning
of a sentence written in braille, sigma factors use “touch” to
identify the beginning of a gene. A sigma factor first binds to
RNA polymerase through the beta and beta-prime subunits

(see the dotted black outline in Fig. 8.3). The bound sigma
factor helps the core enzyme detect a specific DNA sequence,
called the promoter, marking the beginning of a gene. A single bacterial species can make several different sigma factors.
Each sigma factor helps core RNA polymerase find the start
of a different subset of genes. However, a single core polymerase complex can bind only one sigma factor at a time.
Hundreds of sigma factor genes have been sequenced from
numerous species of bacteria and archaea. Although they all
encode somewhat different amino acid sequences, there are
enough sequence and structural similarities to make them
recognizable as sigma factors.

the case of E. coli and other rod-shaped, Gram-negative

70-kilodalton (kDa) protein (its gene designation is rpoD).
Genes recognized by sigma-70 all contain similar promoter sequences that consist of two parts. The DNA base

corresponding to the start of the RNA transcript is called
nucleotide +1 (+1 nt). Relative to this landmark, promoter
sequences are characteristically centered at –10 and –35 nt
before the start of transcription (see Fig. 8.4). Other sigma
factors typically recognize different consensus sequences at
one or both of these positions (or at nearby locations in
some cases), or they shape the overall polymerase complex
to bind the promoter.
The DNA promoter sequence recognized by a given
sigma factor can be determined by comparing known
promoter sequences of different genes whose expression
requires the same sigma. Similarities among these different promoter DNA sequences define a consensus sequence
likely recognized by the sigma factor (Fig. 8.4A and B).
A consensus sequence consists of the most likely base (or
bases) at each position of the predicted promoter. Although
promoters are double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sequences,
convention is to present the promoter as the single-stranded
DNA (ssDNA) sequence of the sense strand (nontemplate
strand), which has the same sequence as the RNA product.

Sigma factor recognition of promoters. How do sigma fac-

tors, or any other DNA-binding proteins for that matter, recognize specific DNA sequences when the DNA is a double
helix? The phosphodiester backbone is quite uniform, and
the interior of paired bases appears inaccessible. However,
proteins can still recognize DNA sequences because the
alpha-helical parts of proteins that bind DNA recognize (via
noncovalent bonding) side groups that protrude from the
bases into the major and minor grooves of DNA (see Fig.
7.6). Portions of sigma-70 from E. coli wrap around DNA,
allowing certain parts of the protein to fit into DNA grooves.
Figure 8.5A shows the holoenzyme RNA polymerase
complex positioned at a promoter and the points (–10
and –35 nt) where sigma factor contacts DNA. Sigma factors generally contain four highly conserved amino acid
sequences, called regions (see Fig. 8.3, σ1–σ4). Part of
region 2 of the sigma-70 family recognizes –10 sequences,
whereas region 4 recognizes the –35 sites. Part of region
1 helps separate the DNA strands to make a transcription
“bubble” in preparation for RNA synthesis (Fig. 8.5B).

To Summarize






RNA polymerase holoenzyme, consisting of core RNA
polymerase and a sigma factor, initiates transcription of a
DNA template strand.
Sigma factors help core RNA polymerase locate consensus promoter sequences near the beginning of a gene.
The sequences identified and bound by E. coli sigma-70
are located at –10 and –35 bp upstream of the transcription start site.
Dynamic changes in gene expression follow changes
in the relative levels of different sigma factors.

GENES AND GENOMES



Transcription of
DNA to RNA

1. RNA polymerase holoenzyme
scans DNA for promoter sequences.
RNA polymerase
holoenzyme

Like DNA replication, transcription of DNA to RNA
occurs in three stages:
1. Initiation, in which RNA polymerase binds to the
beginning of the gene, melts open the DNA helix, and
catalyzes placement of the first RNA nucleotide.
2. Elongation, the sequential addition of ribonucleotides
to the 3′ OH end of a growing RNA chain.
3. Termination, whereby sequences at the end of the
gene trigger release of the polymerase and the completed RNA molecule.
The newly released RNA polymerase can then engage
another sigma factor to seek a new promoter.

Transcription Initiation

RNA polymerase constantly scans DNA for promoter
sequences (Fig. 8.6, step 1). It binds DNA loosely and
comes off repeatedly. Once bound to the promoter, RNA
polymerase holoenzyme forms a loosely bound, closed
complex with DNA, which remains annealed and double-stranded—that is, unmelted (step 2). To successfully
transcribe a gene, this closed complex must become an
open complex through the unwinding of one helical turn,
which causes DNA to become unpaired in this area (step 3)
(see also Fig. 8.5B). After promoter unwinding, RNA
polymerase in the open complex becomes tightly bound to
DNA. Region 1 of the sigma factor is important for DNA
unwinding, as is a rudder complex in the beta-prime subunit that separates the two strands.
The open-complex form of RNA polymerase begins transcription. The first ribonucleoside triphosphate (rNTP) of the
new RNA chain is usually a purine (A or G). The purine basepairs to the position designated +1 on the DNA template,
which marks the start of the gene. As the enzyme complex
moves along the template, subsequent rNTPs diffuse through
a channel in the polymerase and into position at the DNA
template. After the first base is in place, each subsequent
rNTP transfers a ribonucleoside monophosphate (rNMP) to
the growing chain while releasing a pyrophosphate (PPi):

The “energy released” (actually the free energy change)
following cleavage of the rNTP triphosphate groups is used
to form the phosphodiester link to the growing polynucleotide chain. (Free energy change, ΔG, is presented in
Chapter 13.)
As seen in Figure 8.5B, the beta-prime subunit forms
part of the pocket, or cleft, in which the DNA template
is read. Another part of the beta-prime cleft is involved
in hydrolyzing rNTPs. Deep at the base of the cleft is the
active site of polymerization, defined by three evolutionarily conserved aspartate residues that chelate (bond with)
two magnesium ions (Mg 2+). As we saw for DNA polymerases, these metal ions play a key role in catalyzing the
polymerization reaction.

TRANSCRIPTION, TRANSLATION, AND BIOINFORMATICS

(Fig. 8.6, step 4). The newly liberated sigma factor can
then recycle onto an unbound core RNA polymerase to
direct another round of promoter binding. Meanwhile,
the original RNA polymerase continues to move along the
template, synthesizing RNA at approximately 45 bases per
second. As the DNA helix unwinds, a 17-bp transcription
bubble forms and moves with the polymerase complex.
DNA unwinding produces positive DNA supercoils ahead
of the advancing bubble. The supercoils are removed by
DNA topoisomerase enzymes (see Section 7.2).

Transcription Termination

How does RNA polymerase know when to stop? Again,
the secret is in the sequence. All bacterial genes use one of
two known transcription termination signals, called either
Rho-dependent or Rho-independent. Rho-dependent termination relies on a protein called Rho and an ill-defined
sequence at the 3′ end of the gene that appears to be a
strong pause site. Pause sites are areas of DNA that slow or
stall the movement of RNA polymerase. Some pause sites
occur within the gene’s open reading frame (ORF), the
part of a gene that actually encodes a protein, to allow time
for the ribosome to catch up to a transcribing RNA polymerase (discussed in Section 8.3). A protein called NusG
binds to RNA polymerase to prevent premature termination at internal pause sites. The transcription termination
pause site, however, is located after the ORF, beyond the
translation stop codon. A stop codon (described later) is a

three-base sequence in mRNA that stops ribosome movement. If transcription stopped before the ribosome reached
the translation stop codon, an incomplete protein would
be made.
Rho factor binds to an exposed region of RNA after
the ORF at C-rich sequences that lack obvious secondary
structure. This is the transcription terminator pause site.
Rho monomers assemble as a hexamer around the RNA
(Fig. 8.7A). Then, like a person pulling a raft to shore by a
rope tied to a tree, Rho pulls itself to the paused RNA polymerase by threading downstream RNA through the ring
via an intrinsic ATPase activity. Once Rho touches the polymerase, an RNA-DNA helicase activity built into Rho appears
to unwind the RNA-DNA heteroduplex, which releases the
completed RNA molecule and frees the RNA polymerase.
The second type of termination event, called Rhoindependent termination, or intrinsic termination, occurs in
the absence of Rho. Rho-independent termination requires
a GC-rich region of RNA roughly 20 bp upstream from
the 3′ terminus, as well as four to eight consecutive uridine
residues at the terminus (Fig. 8.7B). The GC-rich sequence

stem loop, a structure that contacts RNA polymerase. Contact halts nucleotide addition, causing RNA polymerase to
pause. A protein called NusA stimulates transcription pause
at these sites. While the polymerase is paused, the DNARNA duplex is weakened because the poly-U/poly-A base
pairs at the 3′ terminus contain only two hydrogen bonds
per pair, so they are easier to melt. Melting the hybrid molecule releases the transcript and halts transcription. The
pause in polymerase movement, and thus transcription, is
important to prevent the formation of tighter base-pairing
downstream of the UA region.

To be useful in medicine, all antibiotics must meet two
fundamental criteria: They must kill or retard the growth
of a pathogen, and they must not harm the host. Antibiotics used against bacteria, for instance, must selectively
attack features of bacterial targets not shared with eukaryotes. Many antibiotics possess highly specific modes of
action, binding to and altering the activity of one specific
“machine” of one type of cell.

One example is the antibiotic rifamycin B (Fig. 8.8A),
produced by the actinomycete Amycolatopsis mediterranei
(Fig. 8.8B). Rifamycin B selectively targets bacterial RNA
polymerase and binds to the polymerase’s beta subunit near
the Mg 2+ active site, thus blocking the RNA exit channel
(Fig. 8.8C). RNA polymerase can carry out two or three
polymerization steps, but then it stops because the nascent
RNA cannot exit. Rifamycin does not prevent RNA polymerase from binding to promoters, and because an mRNA
molecule already passing through the exit channel masks
the rifamycin-binding site, the drug cannot bind to RNA
polymerases already transcribing DNA. The semisynthetic
derivative of this drug, rifampin, is used for treating tuberculosis and leprosy and is given to contacts (family members or roommates) of individuals with bacterial meningitis
caused by Neisseria meningitidis.
Actinomycin D (Fig. 8.9A) is another antibiotic produced by an actinomycete. Its phenoxazone ring is a planar structure that “squeezes,” or intercalates, between GC
base pairs within DNA. The side chains then extend in
opposite directions along the minor groove (Fig. 8.9B).
Because it mimics a DNA base, actinomycin D blocks the
elongation phase of transcription; but because it binds any
DNA, it is not selective for bacteria. It can be used to treat

human cancers because cancer cells replicate rapidly, but
it has severe side effects because it inhibits DNA synthesis
in normal cells too. (Antibiotics are discussed further in
Chapter 27.)
How did scientists determine the details of RNA and
protein synthesis? First, purified RNA polymerase and ribosomes were used to demonstrate transcription and translation in cell-free systems (in test tubes). Then, protein
subunits of RNA polymerase extracted from antibioticresistant and sensitive strains of E. coli were mixed together
to reconstruct chimeric molecules. To determine which
RNA polymerase subunit was targeted by the antibiotic
rifamycin, for instance, RNA polymerases from rifamycinsensitive and rifamycin-resistant strains were purified from
cell extracts. The component parts of the polymerases were
separated and a chimeric RNA polymerase was reassembled
(like a 3D jigsaw puzzle) by mixing subunits from antibioticsensitive and antibiotic-resistant polymerases. The reconstituted polymerase preparation was tested to see whether it

could make RNA in the presence of rifamycin. Resistance
will happen only when the subunit conveying resistance has
been added—in this case, the beta subunit. Investigators
used this information in subsequent in vitro assays and X-ray
crystallography to learn more about the enzymatic mechanism of the beta subunit.

Different Classes of RNA
Have Different Functions

It is important to note that not all RNA molecules are
translated to protein. There are several classes of RNA,
each designed for a different purpose (Table 8.1). The class
of RNA molecules that encode proteins is called messenger RNA (mRNA). Molecules of mRNA average 1,000–
1,500 bases in length but can be much longer or shorter,
depending on the size of the protein they encode. Another
class of RNA, called ribosomal RNA (rRNA), forms
the scaffolding on which ribosomes are built. As will be

discussed later, rRNA also forms the catalytic center of the
ribosome. Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules ferry amino
acids to the ribosome. A unique property of rRNA and
tRNA is the presence of unusual modified bases not found
in other types of RNA.
The fourth important class of RNA is called small RNA
(sRNA). Molecules of sRNA do not encode proteins but
are used to regulate the stability or translation of specific
mRNAs into proteins (for example, RNA thermometers are
discussed in Chapter 10). As will be discussed later in more
detail, all mRNA molecules contain untranslated leader
sequences that precede the actual coding region. Complementary sequences within some of these RNA leader
regions snap back on themselves to form double-stranded
stems and stem loop structures that can obstruct ribosome
access and limit translation. Regulatory sRNAs can basepair with these regions in mRNA and either disrupt or stabilize intrastrand stem structures.
The final two classes of RNA are tmRNA, which has
properties of both tRNA and mRNA (discussed later), and
catalytic RNA. Catalytic RNA molecules, also referred to
as ribozymes, are usually found associated with proteins
in which the enzymatic (catalytic) activity actually resides
in the RNA portion of the complex rather than in the protein. All of these functional RNAs may represent remnants
of the ancient “RNA world,” where the earliest ancestral
cells were built of RNA parts whose functions were later
assumed by proteins. The RNA-world model is discussed
in Chapter 17.

RNA Stability

Once released from RNA polymerase, most prokaryotic
mRNA transcripts are doomed to a short existence owing
to their degradation by intracellular RNases. Why would a
cell tolerate this seemingly wasteful practice? Remember,
bacteria face extremely rapid changes in their environment,
including changes in temperature, salinity, or nutrients,
to name a few. To survive, cells must be prepared to react
quickly and halt synthesis of superfluous or even detrimental proteins. An effective way to do this is to rapidly destroy
the mRNAs that encode those proteins. Unfortunately,
rapid mRNA degradation makes it necessary to continually
transcribe those genes as long as their products are needed.
RNA stability is measured in terms of half-life, which is the
length of time the cell needs to degrade half the molecules of
a given mRNA species. The average half-life for mRNA is
1–3 minutes but can be as little as 15 seconds. Other RNAs
can be fairly stable, with half-lives of 10–20 minutes or longer. However, the stabilities of the different kinds of RNAs
differ drastically. The mRNAs are usually unstable compared
to rRNAs and tRNAs, which contain modified bases less
susceptible to RNase digestion. These more stable RNA molecules have half-lives on the order of hours.
The major RNA-degrading machine of E. coli, the degradosome, is a four-protein complex including an RNase, an
RNA helicase, and two metabolic enzymes. The degradosome
complex is organized in a helical cytoskeletal structure associated with the cell membrane. These findings suggest that
the RNA degradosome is compartmentalized within the cell.

catalytic activity (catalytic RNA), or function as a combination of tRNA and mRNA (tmRNA).


To Summarize




Half-lives of RNA species vary within the cell.

8.3

Initial binding of RNA polymerase to promoter DNA
forms the closed complex.
The DNA strands separate (melt) and form a “bubble” of DNA around the polymerase called the open
complex.

Translation of RNA
to Protein

Once a gene has been copied into mRNA, the next stage
is translation, the decoding of the RNA message to synthesize protein. An mRNA molecule can be thought of as
a sentence in which triplets of nucleotides, called codons,
represent individual words, or amino acids (Fig. 8.10).
Ribosomes are the machines that read the language of
mRNA and convert, or translate, it into protein. Translation
involves numerous steps, the first of which is the search by
ribosomes for the beginning of an mRNA protein-coding
region. Because the code consists of triplet codons, a ribosome must start translating at precisely the right base (in the
right frame), or the product will be gibberish. Before we discuss how the ribosome finds the right reading frame, let’s
review the code itself and the major players in translation.

Antibiotics that inhibit bacterial transcription
include rifamycin B (which binds to RNA polymerase
to inhibit transcription initiation) and actinomycin D
(which binds DNA to nonselectively inhibit transcription elongation).
Rho-dependent and Rho-independent mechanisms
mediate transcription termination.
Messenger RNA (mRNA) molecules encode proteins.
Noncoding RNAs include ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs),
transfer RNAs (tRNAs), and small RNAs. Small
RNAs can regulate gene expression (sRNA), have

PART 2



GENES AND GENOMES

The Genetic Code and tRNA Molecules

When learning a new language, we need a dictionary
that converts words from one language into the other.
In the case of gene expression, how do we convert from
the 4-base language of RNA to the protein language of
20 amino acids? Through painstaking effort, Marshall
Nirenberg, Har Gobind Khorana, and colleagues cracked
the molecular code and found that each codon (a triplet of
nucleotides) represents an individual amino acid. Remarkably, and with few exceptions, the code operates universally across species. (Exceptions include UGA, which is
normally read as a stop codon but encodes tryptophan in
vertebrate mitochondria, Saccharomyces, and mycoplasmas; and CUG, which encodes serine instead of leucine in
Candida albicans.) In the code presented in Figure 8.10,
we can see that most amino acids have multiple codon
synonyms. Glycine (Gly), for example, is translated from
four different codons, and leucine (Leu) from six, but
methionine (Met) and tryptophan (Trp) each have only
one codon. Because more than one codon can encode
the same amino acid, the code is said to be degenerate
or redundant. Notice that in almost every case, synonymous codons differ only in the last base. How the cell
handles this degeneracy (redundancy) in the code will be
explained later.

Only 61 out of a possible 64 codons specify amino acids.
Four of these act as codons that can mark the beginning
of the protein “sentence.” In order of preference, they are
AUG (90%), GUG (8.9%), UUG (1%), and CUG (0.1%).
Because of its inefficiency in starting translation, the use of
a rare start codon, such as CUG, limits the translation of
any ORF in which it is found. Although these start codons
are used to begin all proteins, they are not restricted to that
role; they also encode amino acids found in the middle of
coding sequences. Consequently, there must be something
else about mRNA that signifies whether an AUG codon, for
example, marks the start of a protein or resides internally,
where it codes for an amino acid (as will be discussed shortly).
The remaining three triplets (UAA, UAG, and UGA)
are equally important, for they tell the ribosome when to
stop reading a gene sentence. Called stop codons, they
trigger a series of events (to be described later) that dismantle ribosomes from mRNA and release a completed protein.

Note:

There are actually 21 or 22 amino acids found in the
proteins of some microbes. The extra amino acids, however, are
modifications of one of the basic 20. Selenocysteine, for instance,
is synthesized by modifying a serine bound to a tRNA molecule.
The selenocysteinyl tRNA recognizes UGA, normally a stop codon.
There is no pool of free selenocysteine in the cell.

Thought Question

8.4 How might the redundancy of the genetic code be used

to establish evolutionary relationships between different
species? Hints: 1. Genomes of different species have different
overall GC content. 2. Within a given genome one can find segments of DNA sequence with a GC content distinctly different
from that found in the rest of the genome.

The decoder (or adapter) molecules that convert the language of RNA (codons) to the language of proteins (amino
acids) are the tRNAs. Their job is to travel through the
cell and return to the ribosome with amino acids in tow.
Approximately 80 bases in length, a tRNA laid flat looks
like a clover leaf with three loops (Fig. 8.11A and B). In
nature, however, the molecule folds into the “boomeranglike” 3D structure shown in Figure 8.11C. The very bottom, or middle, loop of all tRNA molecules (as depicted in
Fig. 8.11B and C) harbors an anticodon triplet that basepairs with codons in mRNA (Fig. 8.12). As a result, this
loop is called the anticodon loop. Notice that codon and
anticodon pairings are aligned in an antiparallel manner.
Most tRNA molecules begin with a 5′ G, and all end with
a 3′ CCA, to which an amino acid attaches (see Figs. 8.11
and 8.12). Because the 3′ end of the tRNA accepts the
amino acid, it is called the acceptor end.
Transfer RNA molecules contain a large number of
unusual, modified bases, which accounts for the strange
letter codes seen in Figure 8.11A (D, M, Y, T, and Ψ).
Structures of some of the odd bases are shown in Figure 8.13. Wybutosine (yW), for example, has three rings
instead of the two found in a normal purine. How do these
unusual bases end up in tRNA? During transcription of
the tRNA genes, normal, unmodified bases are incorporated into the transcript. Some of these are modified later
by specific enzymes to make inosine and other odd bases.
The remarkable stability of tRNA molecules is explained,
in part, by these unusual bases, because they are poor substrates for RNases.
In the cloverleaf structure of tRNA, two of the loops
are named after modifications that are invariantly present
in those loops. One is called the TΨC loop because this
loop in every tRNA has the nucleotide triplet consisting
of thymidine, pseudouridine (Ψ), and cytidine. The other

GENES AND GENOMES

loop always contains dihydrouridine and is called the
DHU loop (see Figs. 8.11 and 8.12). These loops are recognized by the enzymes that match tRNA to the proper
amino acid.
As noted previously, the genetic code is redundant in
that many amino acids have codon synonyms. Redundancy is found primarily in the third position of the
codon (for example, UUU and UUC both encode phenylalanine). A single tR NA can recognize both codons
because of “wobble” in the first position of the anticodon, which corresponds to the third position of the
codon (remember, as with DNA, base-pairing between
R NA strands is antiparallel). The wobble is due in part
to the curvature of the anticodon loop and to the use of
an unusual base (inosine) at this position in some tR NA

molecules. The wobble structure allows one anticodon
to pair with several codons differing only in the third
position.

Aminoacyl-tRNA Synthetases
Attach Amino Acids to tRNA

When a tRNA anticodon (for instance, GCG) pairs with
its complementary codon (CGC in this case), the ribosome has no way of checking that the tRNA is attached
(that is, charged) to the “correct” amino acid (here, arginine). Consequently, each tRNA must be charged with
the proper amino acid before it encounters the ribosome. How are amino acids correctly matched to tRNA
molecules and affixed to their 3′ ends? The charging of
tRNAs is carried out by a set of enzymes called aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Each cell has generally 20 of
these “match and attach” proteins—one for each amino

The Ribosome, a Translation Machine

The decoding process of the ribosome may be compared
to a language translation machine that converts one language into another. The ribosome can be viewed as translating the language of the mRNA code into the amino acid
sequences of proteins that conduct the activities of the cell.
Ribosomes are composed of two complex subunits, each of
which includes rRNA and protein components. In prokaryotes, the subunits are named 30S and 50S for their “size”
in Svedberg units. A Svedberg unit reflects the rate at
which a molecule sediments under the centrifugal force of
a centrifuge (discussed in eAppendix 3). Within the living
cell, the two subunits exist separately but come together on
mRNA to form the translating 70S ribosome (Fig. 8.15).
(Note that Svedberg units are not directly additive, because
they represent a rate of sedimentation, not a mass.)



The smaller, 30S subunit (900,000 Da) contains 21 ribosomal proteins (named S1–S21; S = “small”) assembled
around one 16S rRNA molecule. The 50S subunit (1.6 million Da) consists of 31 proteins [designated L1–L34 (three
numbers were not used); L = “large”] formed around two
rRNA molecules (5S and 23S). Figure 8.16 presents the
3D spatial arrangement of rRNA and protein in the 50S
subunit. Note that the majority of the ribosome is RNA.
How does such a complex molecular machine get
built? As discussed in greater detail in eTopic 8.1, assembly begins with the transcription of ribosomal RNA genes
(DNA), sometimes referred to as rDNA. The 16S, 23S,
and 5S rRNAs are initially transcribed as one RNA molecule and posttranscriptionally processed into separate
rRNA molecules. During rRNA transcription, ribosomal
proteins begin to assemble within the secondary rRNA
structures. Thus, the ribosome is built by precise, timed
molecular RNA-RNA, RNA-protein, and protein-protein
interactions.

Thought Question

8.5 The synthesis of ribosomal RNAs and ribosomal proteins
represents a major energy drain on the cell. How might the cell
regulate the synthesis of these molecules when the growth
rate slows because amino acids are limiting? Hint: Predict
what happens to any translating ribosome when an amino acid
is limiting. Look up RelA protein on the Internet.

in the A site. The mRNA (light blue) travels along the 30S subunit,
and the growing peptide (yellow) exits from a channel formed in the
50S subunit. (PDB codes: 1GIX and 1GIY)

The 70S ribosome harbors three binding sites for tRNA
(Fig. 8.17
). During translation, each tRNA molecule moves through the sites in an assembly-line fashion,
first entering at one site, and then moving progressively
through the others before being jettisoned from the ribosome. The first position is the aminoacyl-tRNA acceptor
site (A site), which binds an incoming aminoacyl-tRNA.
The growing peptide is attached to tRNA berthed in the
peptidyl-tRNA site (P site). Finally, a tRNA recently
stripped of the polypeptide is located in the exit site
(E site). Figure 8.17 also illustrates the path mRNA takes
into the ribosome and the nascent (that is, growing) peptide emerging from it.

The Ribosome Is a “Ribozyme”

The ribosome makes the peptide bonds that stitch amino
acids together, and it does so by using a remarkable enzymatic activity called peptidyltransferase, present in the 50S
subunit. Contrary to expectation, the peptidyltransferase

activity resides not in ribosomal proteins, but in the rRNA.
Peptidyltransferase is actually a ribozyme (an RNA molecule that carries out catalytic activity), and it is a part of 23S
rRNA that is highly conserved across all species (Fig. 8.16
inset, loop V). Proteins surrounding this active center offer
structural assistance to ensure that the RNA is folded properly and to interact with tRNA substrates.
The sequences of ribosomal RNAs from all microbes are
very similar, in large part because rRNA plays an important catalytic role in the activities of ribosomes. But there
are differences in rRNA sequences that increase in relation to the evolutionary distance between species. As a
result, rRNA serves as a molecular clock that measures the

How Do Ribosomes Find the
Right Reading Frame?

Every mRNA has three potential reading frames, depending on which base the ribosome happens to start with. A
ribosome that chooses the wrong frame will produce proteins with totally different amino acid sequences. In addition, a shifted reading frame often generates an inadvertent
stop codon that prematurely terminates the peptide. So
how does the ribosome find the right frame? The key is a
section of untranslated RNA sequence positioned upstream
of the protein-coding segment of mRNA. The upstream
leader RNA contains a purine-rich consensus sequence
(5′-AGGAGGU-3′) located four to eight bases upstream of
the start codon. This upstream sequence is called the ribosome-binding site or Shine-Dalgarno sequence, after
Lynn Dalgarno and her student John Shine at Australian
National University, who discovered it in 1974.
The Shine-Dalgarno site is complementary to a sequence
at the 3′ end of 16S rRNA (5′-ACCUCCU-3′), found in
the 30S ribosome subunit. Binding of mRNA to this site
positions the start codon (such as AUG or GUG) precisely
in the ribosome P site, ready to pair with an N-formylmethionyl-tRNA. Elegant proof that the Shine-Dalgarno
sequence actually binds to the 3′ end of 16S rRNA is
described in eTopic 8.2.
Recall from Section 7.2 that many genes in the bacterial
chromosome are arranged in tandem (an operon) and are
transcribed together to produce a polygenic (formerly polycistronic) mRNA. Because the beginning of each gene in
a polygenic mRNA carries its own ribosome-binding site,
different ribosomes can bind simultaneously to the start of
each gene. Mutating the first gene in a three-gene operon
can halt translation of the first protein, but the second
and third proteins can still be translated because the RNA
sequence for each has its own ribosome-binding site.

CHAPTER 8



TRANSCRIPTION, TRANSLATION, AND BIOINFORMATICS

Note:

Eukaryotic ribosomes have a different mechanism for
finding the start codon. They generally start translating at the first
AUG after the 5′ cap. The 5′ cap is a 7-methylguanosine added posttranscriptionally to the 5′ end of eukaryotic mRNA molecules. The
normal role of the cap is thought to be as a signal to transport RNA
out of the nucleus and/or to stabilize mRNA.

Polysomes, Coupled Transcription/
Translation, and Transertion
Polysomes. Once a ribosome begins translating mRNA

and moves off of the ribosome-binding site, another ribosome can immediately jump onto that site. The result is
an RNA molecule with multiple ribosomes moving along
its length at the same time. The multiribosome structure
is known as a polysome (Fig. 8.18A). Ribosomes in a

polysome are closely packed and arranged helically along
the mRNA (Fig. 8.18B). Polysomes help protect the message from degrading RNases and enable the speedy production of protein from just a single mRNA molecule.
Coupled transcription and translation. Because bacte-

ria and archaea lack nuclear membranes, ribosome subunits floating through the cytoplasm have an opportunity
to bind to the 5′ end of mRNA and begin making protein even before RNA polymerase has fi nished making
the mRNA molecule. The simultaneous building of both
mRNA and proteins is called coupled transcription and
translation (Fig. 8.18A). For certain genes, transcriptiontranslation coupling requires a protein to physically link the
ribosome to RNA polymerase. One such protein is RfaH,
described in the Current Research Highlight.
The coupling of transcription and translation in bacteria
makes it possible for the cell to use translation as a means
of regulating transcription. One process, attenuation, is
explained further in Chapter 10. Note, however, that much,
if not most, translation—at least in E. coli and Bacillus subtilis—seems to occur at the polar ends of cells, which are
polyribosome-rich and have little to no DNA (Fig. 8.19).
Thus, although transcription-translation coupling happens
when transcripts are first made, most translation occurs on
free mRNA transcripts that have diffused away from the
nucleoid and into polyribosome-rich areas.
The coupling of transcription and translation presents a
potential problem. Ribosomes generally travel along mRNA
more slowly than mRNA is generated by RNA polymerase,
so RNA polymerase can potentially scoot ahead of the
ribosome and leave large tracts of RNA unprotected and
susceptible to nucleases. The cell handles this problem by
modulating transcription speed. The rate of RNA synthesis
averages about 45 nt per second, which roughly equals the
average rate of translation (16 amino acids per second, or

48 nt/s). However, these speeds vary. For example, RNA
polymerase pauses momentarily at sites rich in GC content
(GC base pairs, with three hydrogen bonds, are harder to
melt than AT pairs, which have only two hydrogen bonds).
Once sigma factor exits the transcription complex, proteins
called NusA and NusG enter the complex and can actually
lengthen the pause in RNA polymerase activity to allow
time for the trailing protein-synthesizing ribosome to catch
up to the polymerase. Pausing allows the ribosome to follow RNA polymerase closely and protect the RNA.
Transertion. Transcription-translation
coupling has
another benefit for the bacterial cell: expanding, or decompacting, the nucleoid. Many membrane proteins are inserted
into membranes while they are still being translated (Section 8.5 discusses protein secretion mechanisms). The
cotranslational insertion of membrane proteins sets up a
situation whereby transcription, translation, and membrane
insertion can all be coupled—a process called transertion.
Transertion links the nucleoid to the cell membrane along
the cylindrical portion of the cell and expands the width
of the nucleoid. This expansion may help, among other
things, to counteract nucleoid contraction produced by
transcription-generated DNA supercoils. Decompaction
will facilitate diffusion of ribosome subunits, RNA polymerase, and regulatory proteins into the nucleoid.
Transcription in eukaryotic microbes is not coupled to
translation. In contrast to bacteria and archaea, eukaryotic

microbes use separate cellular compartments to carry out
most of their transcription and translation. They transcribe

genes in the nucleus where internal, noncoding parts of the
mRNA (introns) are removed by a process known as RNA
splicing. The processed transcripts are then transported
to the cytoplasm and translated. Most eukaryotic DNA
viruses do the same. However, a small amount of translation is performed in the eukaryotic nucleus, where it can
also be coupled to transcription.

Defining a Gene

Before we describe the mechanics of translation, it will help
to illustrate the alignments between the DNA sequence
of a structural gene (a gene encoding a protein), and the
mRNA transcript containing translation signals and the
protein-coding sequences. Figure 8.20 shows the “sense”
and “template” DNA strands of a two-gene operon. The
sequence of the sense strand matches that of the mRNA
transcript, but with T’s substituting for U’s. The template
strand is the strand actually “read” by RNA polymerase.
Note that +1 marks the DNA base where the mRNA transcript starts and that a single transcript includes both operon
genes (polygenic). In the mRNA transcript, an untranslated “leader” sequence precedes the gene A protein-coding
region, located between translation start and stop signals
(discussed later). Downstream of the translation stop signal
for gene B lies an untranslated “trailer.” The leader and
trailer sequences help regulate gene expression. As you proceed in this chapter, refer back to Figure 8.20 to clarify
important relationships connecting a DNA operon, its
composite genes, the polygenic transcript, and the resulting proteins.

The Three Stages of Protein Synthesis

Once the ribosome has been properly positioned on the
message, peptide synthesis can begin. Like transcription, peptide synthesis has three stages: initiation, which
brings the two ribosomal subunits together, placing the
first amino acid in position; elongation, which sequentially adds amino acids as directed by the mRNA transcript; and termination. Several steps in this process can
be inhibited by certain antibiotics (described later in this
section).

Initiation of translation. In bacteria such as E. coli, initia-

Initially, IF3 binds to the 30S subunit to separate the
30S and 50S subunits. Separating the subunits allows other
initiation factors and mRNA access to the 30S subunit
(Fig. 8.21
, step 1). IF1 and mRNA join the 30S subunit. IF1 blocks the tRNA A site, and the mRNA sequence
for the ribosome-binding site aligns with its complementary sequence on 16S rRNA (step 2 ). Next, IF2 complexed
to GTP escorts the initiator N-formylmethionyl-tRNA
(fMet-tRNA) to the start codon located at what will be the

all start codons and is the only aminoacyl-tRNA to bind
directly to the P site. Once the initiator tRNA is in place,
GTP is hydrolyzed, and IF1 and IF3 are released (step 5).
The 50S subunit then docks to the 30S subunit (step 6).
The ribosome is now “locked and loaded,” ready for elongation. Note that initiation is much more complex in the
Archaea, involving as many as six different IF proteins.

Elongation of the peptide. In elongation, three basic

steps are repeated: (1) An aminoacyl-tRNA binds to the
A (acceptor) site; (2) a peptide bond forms between the
new amino acid and the growing peptide pre-positioned
in the P site; (3) the message must move by one codon
(Fig. 8.22 ). First an elongation factor (EF-Tu) associates with GTP to form a complex (EF-Tu-GTP) that binds
to most charged aminoacyl-tRNAs (except for the initiator tRNA). Sequences within the 50S rRNA recognize
features of the EF-Tu-GTP–aminoacyl-tRNA complex,
guiding it into the A site (Fig. 8.22, step 1). Correct selection of a tRNA is guided in large part by codon-anticodon pairing, but conformational changes sensed by various
ribosomal proteins customize the fit. If the fit is not perfect, the tRNA is rejected.
Once an aminoacyl-tRNA is in the A site, a peptide
bond is formed between the amino acid moored there
and the terminal amino acid linked to tRNA in the P site.
Simultaneously, a GTP is hydrolyzed and the resulting EFTu-GDP is expelled. Peptide bond formation effectively
transfers the peptide from the tRNA in the P site to tRNA
in the A site (Fig. 8.22, steps 2 and 3).
For protein synthesis to continue, the ribosome must
advance by one codon, which moves the peptidyl-tRNA
from the A site into the P site, leaving the A site vacant.
The process, called translocation, involves another elongation factor, EF-G, associated with GTP. EF-G-GTP binds
to the ribosome, GTP is hydrolyzed, and the 30S subunit rotates clockwise to ratchet the 50S subunit ahead on
the message by one codon (step 4). The 30S subunit then
rotates back (step 5). How EF-G uses a fingerlike motion to
complete translocation is explained in Special Topic 8.1.
The translocation maneuver opens up the A site, moves the
peptidyl-tRNA into the P site, and slides uncharged tRNA
into the E (exit) site. The next aminoacyl-tRNA that enters
the A site stimulates a conformational change in the ribosome that telegraphs through to the E site and ejects the
uncharged tRNA.
Notice that EF-Tu and EF-G recycle sequentially on and
off the ribosome by binding to the same area of the ribosome. Because EF-G-GTP and the EF-Tu-GTP–aminoacyl-tRNA complex are structurally similar (an example of
molecular mimicry) and because both bind to the same site,
the two factors must cycle on and off the ribosome sequentially. Although this process seems incredibly complex, the
ribosomes of E. coli manage to link together 16 amino acids
per second. Scientists have now visualized the staggered
movements of a single ribosome as it translates an mRNA
molecule (eTopic 8.3).

SPECIAL TOPIC 8.1, , Translocation: EF-G Gets Physical

THE BLAVATNIK FAMILY FOUNDATION/©THE NEW YORK ACADEMY OF SCIENCE.
ALL RIGHT RESERVED.

Translocation of the ribosome down an mRNA molecule is a
critical part of translation. Ribosomes must move one codon
along an mRNA molecule while tRNAs in the ribosome A
(acceptor) site and P (peptidyl-tRNA) site shift to the P site
and E (exit) site, respectively. Elongation factor G (EF-G) plays
a major role in this process. When EF-G-GTP binds to a pretranslocation ribosome (see Fig. 8.22), it triggers the ratchetlike movement of the 30S subunit relative to the 50S subunit.
During subunit ratcheting, the CCA acceptor ends of tRNAs
move from the A and P sites to the P and E sites, leaving the
anticodon ends in the original sites. Hydrolysis of GTP bound
to EF-G then moves the anticodon ends of these tRNAs, along
with mRNA, to the new sites. The result is the posttranslocation ribosome in which mRNA has moved one codon and
tRNAs in the A and P sites have moved to the P and E sites,
respectively (see Fig. 8.22).
One question, however, has troubled structural biologists

region is marked by one of three stop codons. Translocation after forming the last peptide bond brings
the mRNA stop codon into the A site (Fig. 8.23 ,
step 1). No tRNA binds, but one of two release
factors (RF1 or RF2) will enter (also step 1). RF
binding leads to ejection of tRNA in the E site and
activates the peptidyltransferase, thereby cutting the
bond that tethers the completed peptide to tRNA in
the P site (step 2).
With the protein released, the ribosome must
disassemble. RF3 causes RF1 or RF2 to depart
the ribosome (Fig. 8.23, step 3). Then, ribosome
recycling factor (RRF), along with EF-G, binds at
the A site, and an accompanying GTP hydrolysis
undocks the two ribosomal subunits (step 4). IF3
then reenters the 30S subunit to eject the remaining uncharged tRNA and mRNA (step 5), thereby
preventing the 30S and 50S subunits from redocking. The liberated ribosomal subunits are now
free to diffuse through the cell, ready to bind yet
another mRNA and begin the translation sequence
anew.

the end of the mRNA with a peptidyl-tRNA in the ribosome
P site. How can the cell fix this potentially toxic situation?
The answer is a translation rescue molecule, tmRNA,
with properties of tRNA and mRNA. The tRNA end has
an attached amino acid (alanine). The mRNA end encodes
a peptide tag (Fig. 8.25A). When tmRNA finds a stalled
ribosome, the aminoacyl-tRNA end enters the unoccupied
ribosome A site (Fig. 8.25B, steps 1 and 2). A peptide bond
forms between the stalled polypeptide and the alanine on the
A.

tmRNA (step 3). The tmRNA is now attached to the nascent
peptide and translocates to the P site (step 4). The mRNA
section of tmRNA then displaces the old mRNA and is
translated (step 5). Translation adds a 10-amino-acid peptide
tag to the carboxyl end of the incomplete protein, marking
the protein for destruction. A stop codon in tmRNA triggers
protein release and ribosome disassembly (step 6). Finally,
a helper protein (SspB) recognizes the proteolysis tag and
brings the useless aberrant polypeptide to the ClpXP protease
(discussed in Section 8.4) for degradation. Mutant cells lacking this rescue system often struggle to grow.

Translation terminates upon reaching a stop codon. A

tRNA in the P site.
Ribosome release factor and EF-G bind to the A site to
dissociate the two ribosomal subunits from the mRNA.
Antibiotics that affect translation can cause ribosomes to misread mRNA (streptomycin; binds 30S
subunit), inhibit aminoacyl-tRNA binding to the A site
(tetracycline; binds 30S subunit), interfere with peptidyltransferase (chloramphenicol; binds 50S subunit), trigger peptidyltransferase prematurely (puromycin; binds A
site, 50S subunit), cause translocation to abort (erythromycin; binds 50S subunit), or prevent translocation
(fusidic acid; binds EFG).
tmRNA rescues ribosomes stuck on damaged mRNA
that lacks a stop codon.

8.4

Protein Modification,
Folding, and Degradation

Once a protein is made, is it functional? For many proteins,
translation is not the last step in producing a functional
molecule. Often a protein must be modified after translation either to achieve an appropriate 3D structure or to
regulate its activity. Primary, secondary, and tertiary structures of proteins can be modified after the primary protein sequence has been assembled by the ribosomes. And
what happens when a protein is damaged or is no longer
needed? A healthy cell “cleans house” by degrading damaged or unneeded proteins. The precious amino acids are
then recycled into making new proteins.

Protein Processing after Translation

Completed proteins released from the ribosome contain
N-formylmethionine (fMet) at the N terminus (as previously

Protein Folding: Assume the Position

As a new protein emerges from the ribosome, how does
it fold into exactly the correct shape to do its job? Christian Anfinsen (1916–1995) won the 1972 Nobel Prize in
Chemistry for demonstrating that, for some proteins, folding is governed solely by the protein itself. In other words,
the optimal 3D structure of a protein is determined solely
by the linear sequence of amino acid residues. But three
decades later, other scientists discovered that the folding
of many proteins requires assistance from other proteins.
These helper proteins are called chaperones (or chaperonins). Chaperones associate with target proteins during
some phase of the folding process and then dissociate,
usually after folding of the target protein is completed.
Although chaperones exhibit some specificity, a given
chaperone can help fold many different types of proteins.
The major chaperone family in most species includes
GroEL (60 kDa), GroES (10 kDa), DnaK (70 kDa), DnaJ
(40 kDa), and trigger factor (48 kDa). Because their levels

described). With some proteins, the N-formyl group is “sliced”
off the N terminus by methionine deformylase, leaving methionine. For other amino acids, methionine aminopeptidase
removes the entire amino acid. N-formylmethionine (fMet)
is important during the course of an infection because fMet
peptides are produced only by bacteria and mitochondria, not
by archaea or by the cytoplasmic ribosomes of eukaryotes.
Our white blood cells can detect low concentrations of fMet
peptides (around 10 –12 M) as a sign of invading bacteria or of
necrotic (dying) host cells releasing mitochondria.
Other types of protein processing, such as the addition of acetyl groups or AMP, can change protein function. Proteolytic cleavages can either activate or inactivate
a protein. Examples of modified bacterial enzymes include
glutamine synthetase (adenylylation), isocitrate dehydrogenase (phosphorylation), and a variety of ribosomal proteins
(acetylation). These modifications directly regulate enzyme
activity (glutamine synthetase and isocitrate dehydrogenase) or alter tertiary structure (ribosomal proteins).

nature are called HSP70s, while
homologs of GroEL and DnaJ are
called, respectively, HSP60s and
HSP40s. Chaperones increase in
response to heat stress because
they are needed to help refold

protein fits inside. The small capping protein GroES controls entrance to the chamber, as shown in Figure 8.26A
and eTopic 8.4. Cycles of ATP binding and hydrolysis
cause conformational changes within the chamber that
can reconfigure target proteins. DnaK (HSP70) chaperones have a very different structure (Fig. 8.26B). They
do not form rings like the GroEL and GroES chaperones,
but can clamp down on a peptide to assist folding. Proteins emerging from a bacterial ribosome enter a folding
pathway that involves a hierarchy of these chaperones.

Protein Degradation: Cleaning House

What happens when a cell no longer needs a specific protein or when a cell synthesizes a protein with incorrect
amino acids? Because the cell’s needs constantly change,
the presence of useless proteins can adversely affect the cell
and must be destroyed. This is particularly true of regulatory proteins, whose concentrations must change with time
or in response to alterations in the cellular condition.
Many normal proteins contain degradation signals
called degrons that dictate the stability of a protein. The
N-terminal rule describes one type of degron. The rule
states that the N-terminal amino acid of a protein correlates
with its stability. For example, proteins beginning with leucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, or tyrosine experience a
short half-life (2 minutes or less), whereas proteins with
aspartic acid, glutamic acid, or cysteine in the lead position
have a longer half-life. A protein called ClpS facilitates degradation of these short-lived proteins. ClpS recognizes the

destabilizing N-terminal amino acids and then presents the
protein to the bacterial ClpAP protease (described below).
Abnormally folded proteins are recognized by proteases in part because hydrophobic regions that are normally buried within the protein’s 3D structure become
exposed. The protein is progressively degraded into
smaller and smaller pieces by a series of these proteases.
Initial cuts, usually involving ATP-dependent endoproteases like Lon protein or ClpP, are followed by digestion with tripeptidases and dipeptidases. Endopeptidases
cleave proteins somewhere within the sequence but not
from the ends of the sequence. Many peptidases use ATP
hydrolysis to help unfold the target protein prior to digestion. Unfolding is necessary for the protein to slide into a
barrel-shaped protease such as ClpAP, ClpXP, or ClpYQ in
bacteria (Fig. 8.27).
Bacterial Clp proteases have a proteolytic core made of
two homoheptameric protein rings of either ClpP or ClpY.
The ClpP protease has interchangeable homohexameric
ATPase caps made of ClpX, ClpA, ClpB, or ClpC, each of
which recognizes different substrates. ClpY plays a similar
capping role for ClpQ. The accessory proteins recognize

and present different substrate proteins to the ClpP protease, thereby regulating which proteins are degraded. Protein-degrading enzymes are classified as serine, cysteine, or
threonine proteases, depending on the key residue in their
active sites.
Bacterial Clp proteases are structurally similar to eukaryotic proteasomes, which are even more complex proteindegrading machines. Proteasomes are found primarily in
eukaryotes and archaea, although a few bacteria, such as
the lung pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, have them.
Proteasomes are described in eTopic 8.5. Eukaryotic proteasomes recognize and then degrade proteins tagged by
ubiquitin, a 76-amino-acid peptide. Some bacterial and
viral pathogens exploit ubiquitination to reroute host
metabolism.
What happens to proteins damaged by stress? Are they
always degraded? Microbes are constantly exposed to environmental insults such as high temperature or pH extremes,
which damage proteins and cause them to misfold. As an
energy-saving device and to prevent interruption of protein function, injured proteins go through a kind of triage
process that evaluates whether they are salvageable or must
be destroyed before they can endanger the cell. Chaperones constantly hunt for misfolded (or otherwise damaged)
proteins and attempt to refold them. But if the protein is
released from a chaperone and remains misfolded, it can, by
chance, either reengage the chaperone or bind a protease that
destroys it (Fig. 8.28). This fold-or-destroy triage system is
essential if a microbe is to survive environmental stress.

the protein (for example, phosphate or AMP).
Chaperone proteins help translated proteins fold properly.
All proteins in all cells are eventually degraded by

Secretion: Protein
Traffic Control

Microorganisms, especially Gram-negative bacteria, face a
challenge in delivering proteins to different target locations
in the cell. Recall that Gram-negative microbes are surrounded by two layers of membrane (the inner membrane,
or cell membrane, and an outer membrane), between which
lies a periplasmic space (see Section 3.3). Many proteins are
specifically destined for one or another of these cell compartments. Other proteins are secreted completely out of
the cell into the surrounding environment (for example,
hemolysins that lyse red blood cells). But how do these
diverse proteins know where to go? Protein traffic out of
the cell is directed by an elaborate set of protein secretion
systems. Each system selectively delivers a set of proteins
originally made in the cytoplasm to various extracytoplasmic locations.
The term “secretion” is used to describe movement of a
protein out of the cytoplasm. There are protein secretion
systems that move proteins out of the cytoplasm into the
cytoplasmic membrane and across the membrane to the
periplasm, others that move proteins to the outer membrane, and still others that deliver proteins across both of
the membranes and into the surrounding environment.
An added complication of protein export is
that periplasmic proteins are usually delivered unfolded into the periplasm and require

Translation can then recommence. Some proteins designated for integral membrane location are inserted directly (top). Other integral membrane proteins and proteins destined
for the periplasm are inserted or secreted via the Sec system (bottom).


Protein Export Out
of the Cytoplasm

Proteins destined for the bacterial cell membrane (such as membrane transport proteins)
or envelope regions—including periplasm
(binding proteins), outer membrane (porins),
or extracellular spaces (proteases)—require
special export systems. These systems manage to move hydrophilic proteins through
one or more hydrophobic membrane barriers.
Proteins meant for the inner membrane (for
example, cytochromes) contain very hydrophobic N-terminal signal sequences of 15–30
amino acids. Signal sequences tether nascent
proteins to the membrane and confer conformations that allow the proteins to melt into
the fabric of the membrane. Inner membrane
proteins also contain hydrophobic transmembrane-spanning regions (20–25 amino acids)

CHAPTER 8

that aid in this insertion process. These
hydrophobic regions are important
because they are compatible with the
hydrophobicity of the membrane itself.
A nutrient transport protein often has
12 such membrane-spanning regions,
which weave back and forth across the
membrane.
One special export system begins
with a complex called the signal recognition particle (SRP), which targets
proteins for inner membrane insertion.
A second export mechanism uses a protein called trigger factor that assists proteins destined for the periplasm. (Trigger
factor was mentioned earlier as a chaperone.) These two protein traffic pathways
converge on a general secretion complex composed of three proteins, collectively called the SecYEG translocon,
embedded in the cell (inner) membrane.
Depending on the exported protein,
SecYEG will assist export to the periplasm or insertion into the membrane.

a pre-secretion protein unfolded in the cytoplasm assists
the secretion process because sliding an unfolded protein
through a membrane is far easier than trying to deliver a
folded one.
One model has the SecA ATPase acting like a plunger
(Fig. 8.30, step 4). It inserts deep into the SecYEG channel, shoving about 20 amino acids of the target export protein into the channel. ATP hydrolysis causes SecA to release
the protein and withdraw (step 5). At this point, SecA can
bind fresh ATP, rebind the target protein, and reinsert, pushing another 20 amino acids through. Another protein complex (not shown) may pull the translocating protein out of the
channel. Proteins needed in the periplasm have cleavable signal sequences at their amino-terminal ends. Immediately following translocation of the amino-terminal sequence into the
periplasm, the sequence is snipped off by periplasmic signal
peptidases (LepB is one of several examples in E. coli). This
cleaving completes translocation and releases the mature protein into the periplasm (step 6). Signal peptidases, however,
will not cleave signals from proteins destined to stay embedded within the membrane (integral membrane proteins).

Note:

“Translocation” can refer to the movement of a ribosome along mRNA, or it can describe the movement of a protein
from one cell compartment (cytoplasm) to another (periplasm).

in the ExPortal include HtrA (assists in pili formation and
covalent attachment of proteins to the cell wall) and sortase
(aids maturation of secreted proteins), as well as Sec system components and chaperones. Some proteins that pass
through the ExPortal are truly secreted; others are not.
The latter proteins have a transmembrane domain (missing
in Gram-negative homologs) that anchors the proteins to
the Gram-positive cytoplasmic membrane. The anchored
protein is extracellular but will not float away. Eukaryotic
microbes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae also possess secretion systems that move proteins to the membrane
and beyond. However, the eukaryotic Sec systems are more
complex and are evolutionarily distinct from bacterial Sec
systems. Archaeal secretion systems are actually more similar to those of eukaryotes than to those of bacteria.

Periplasmic proteins delivered by the Sec system arrive
unfolded and inactive. Because the folding chaperones
mentioned earlier are cytoplasmic, periplasmic proteins
need another set of dedicated periplasmic chaperones to
guide their tertiary folding. Another problem with

TRANSCRIPTION, TRANSLATION, AND BIOINFORMATICS

Export of Prefolded Proteins
to the Periplasm

In a dramatic departure from Sec-dependent transport systems, some proteins, like TorA, a component of an anaerobic respiratory chain, can be transported fully folded across
the membrane to their periplasmic destination. These proteins contain the amino acid motif RRXFXK within their
N-terminal signal sequence (where R = arginine, F = phenylalanine, K = lysine, and X = any amino acid). This sequence,
called the “twin arginine motif” targets the protein to the
membrane-embedded twin arginine translocase (TAT),
a transport complex that ships fully folded proteins across
the cell membrane to the periplasm (Fig. 8.32). Whereas

A.



303

Sec-dependent transport is ATP driven, the TAT system is
powered by the proton motive force (see Chapters 4 and 14).
TatA oligomers transiently rupture the membrane bilayer to
form temporary pores that allow protein substrates to pass.

Journeys to the Outer Membrane

Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are made in the cytoplasm and exported to the periplasm by the SecA-dependent
secretion system. Some OMPs have hydrophobic C-terminal
signal sequences that facilitate insertion into the outer membrane, but all have a beta barrel structure that ultimately suits
them for outer membrane placement (for instance, see TolC,
Fig. 8.33 ). Periplasmic chaperones prevent aggregation

of OMPs as they traverse the periplasm and deliver the proteins to a multisubunit, outer membrane machine called the
BAM (beta barrel assembly machine) complex that facilitates
OMP assembly in the outer membrane. Although the players seem to be known, the mechanism by which beta barrels are folded and inserted into the outer membrane bilayer
remains unclear. BAM has also been implicated recently
in the transport of so-called autotransporter proteins such
as the attachment protein pertactin of Bordetella pertussis.
Autotransporters, which also possess a beta barrel domain,
were previously thought to mediate their own transport
across the outer membrane unassisted by other transporters.

membrane systems take over and complete export. Other
systems provide nonstop service, delivering the protein
directly from the cytoplasm to the extracellular space.
The diversity of system design is impressive. It is the
result, in some instances, of selective evolutionary pressures appropriating established cell processes (for example,
pilus assembly). New systems evolve through the accidental duplication of one set of genes followed by random
mutations that innovatively redesign the duplicated set
for a new purpose. We know this because the footprints
of genetic divergence have been left behind in the DNA
sequence. Type I secretion is described here. Other systems
will be covered during the discussion of pathogenesis in
Chapter 25.

Journeys through the Outer Membrane

For many reasons, Gram-negative bacteria need to export
proteins completely out of the cell and into their surrounding environment. Some exported proteins digest extracellular peptides for carbon and nitrogen sources; others act
as free-floating toxins that bind and kill host cells. Still
others are injected directly into eukaryotic cells by pathogenic or symbiotic microbes to commandeer host metabolic processes. Seven secretion systems, identified as type
I–type VII, have evolved to ship these proteins out of the
cell (Table 8.2). A few start with the Sec system just to
get the protein into the periplasm, where dedicated outer

Type I Protein Secretion

Chapter 4 describes the family of ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) influx transporters, whose signature is an amino
acid motif that binds ATP. (The term “cassette” refers to
a sequence of amino acids that is conserved in many proteins with similar functions.) In addition to ABC influx
transporters, similar ABC transporters function in the
opposite direction to export various toxins, proteases, and
lipases, as well as antimicrobial drugs (multidrug efflux
transporters). These ABC transporters are the simplest of

the protein secretion systems and make up what is called
type I protein secretion (for example, the Hly system that
secretes hemolysin; Fig. 8.33). Type I systems all have
three protein components, one of which contains an ATPbinding cassette. One component is an outer membrane
channel, the second is an ABC protein at the inner membrane, and the third is a periplasmic protein lashed to the
inner membrane.
Proteins secreted through type I systems never contact the periplasm, because they pass through a continuous channel that extends from the cytoplasm to the outer
membrane. The inner membrane and periplasmic subunits are generally substrate specific, but numerous ABC
export systems share the channel protein TolC. TolC is
an intriguing protein composed of a beta barrel channel embedded in the outer membrane and an alpha helix
tunnel spanning the periplasm (Fig. 8.33B). The type I
transport shown in Figure 8.33A exports a hemolysin
(HlyA) from E. coli that lyses red blood cell membranes.
HlyB and HlyD are the ABC and periplasmic components, respectively.
Six other protein secretion systems are briefly summarized in Table 8.2. Some move proteins directly from
the cytoplasm to the outside, similar to the type I system, whereas others pick up proteins deposited in the
periplasm by the Sec system. They all play important roles
in microbial pathogenesis and are more fully discussed in
Chapter 25.

To Summarize












Special protein export mechanisms are used to move
proteins to the inner membrane, the periplasm, the outer
membrane, and the extracellular surroundings.
N-terminal amino acid signal sequences help target
membrane proteins to the membrane.
The general secretory system involving the SecYEG
translocon can move unfolded proteins to the inner
membrane or periplasm.
The signal recognition particle (SRP) pauses the
translation of a subset of proteins that will be placed into
the membrane.
SecB protein binds to certain unfolded proteins that
will eventually end up in the periplasm, and pilots them
to the SecYEG translocon.
The twin arginine translocase (TAT) can move a subset of already folded proteins across the inner membrane
and into the periplasm.

Type I secretion systems are ATP-binding cassette
(ABC) mechanisms that move certain secreted proteins directly from the cytoplasm to the extracellular

Bioinformatics: Mining
the Genomes

Discovering how biological information flows from DNA
to RNA to protein was a major accomplishment of the
twentieth century. So, too, was the ability to sequence
DNA and analyze protein structure and function. We can
now call on the vast store of information gathered over the
last half century to make predictions about the genetics and
physiology of microbes even when we cannot grow them in
the laboratory. These predictions are made using bioinformatics, an interdisciplinary field that combines computer
science, mathematics, and statistics. The following sections
reveal basic principles of this field.

Annotating a Genome Sequence

Bioinformatics has forever changed how the science of
microbiology is conducted. Since 1998, the complete
genomes of almost 3,500 microbial species have been published, and many others have been partially sequenced.
Bioinformatic scientists compare genes from different species to deduce an organism’s physiology and evolutionary
development, even if the organism cannot be grown in
the laboratory. Recall that less than 1% of microorganisms can be cultured. Bioinformatics, then, is critical to
understanding the complexity of the uncultured microbial world.
Chapter 7 explained how we sequence a genome and
introduced you to metagenomics. But how do we learn
what genes are encoded in a newly sequenced genome?
The first step is annotation. Annotation is analogous to
identifying separate sentences and words in an unknown
language. Annotating a DNA sequence is done with computers using the known rules of transcription and translation to identify the start and stop sites of potential genes.
DNA sequences are then translated in silico to determine
amino acid sequences. When a sequence appears to encode
a protein, the DNA sequence is called an open reading
frame (ORF).
Seeking ORFs. Computer programs such as ORF fi nders

use the universal genetic code to deduce protein sequences
potentially formed in all reading frames on RNA molecules transcribed from either direction on the chromosome

(Fig. 8.34A). An ORF, the equivalent of a sentence in our
analogy, is defi ned as a DNA sequence that can potentially
encode a string of amino acids of minimum length—say,
50 residues. The 50 residues of the ORF could encode a
5,500-Da (5.5-kDa) protein, since the average weight of an
amino acid is 110 Da. Each ORF begins with a translation
start codon (usually ATG, or more rarely, GTG or TTG). A
translation start codon marks where ribosomes start to read
a messenger RNA molecule. An ORF ends with a translation termination codon (in the DNA, these are TAA, TAG,
or TGA). In addition, the computer can identify an ORF
by looking for potential ribosome-binding sites upstream
of the start codon, but these ribosome-binding sites may
differ between species, so fi nding one is not essential to
declaring the presence of an ORF.
While the preceding methods work for prokaryotes,
identifying ORFs in eukaryotes is more difficult. In
eukaryotes, most genes contain introns (long, noncoding
sequences that occur in the middle of genes), as do the initial mRNA products made from those genes (Fig. 8.34B).
The vast majority of known bacterial and archaeal genes
do not contain introns. Introns serve several regulatory

functions in eukaryotes that determine whether a protein
product is made. However, the eukaryotic cell must use
special splicing mechanisms to remove the intron sequences
and re-join the protein-encoding sequences, called exons,
of the mRNA prior to translation. (In eukaryotic organisms, the RNA transcribed directly from DNA is called
the preliminary mRNA transcript or pre-mRNA; the
“final” mRNA transcript is produced when the introns
have been spliced out.) Because there are few identifying
sequence characteristics that mark an intron, extremely
sophisticated computer analysis is needed to determine
where to remove introns in order to derive the ORF coding sequence of a eukaryotic gene.
Assigning function. We know from considerable experimental precedent that proteins with the same function, regardless of species, usually have critical amino acid sequences
in common because they evolved from the same ancestral
sequence. Sequences common to two different protein or
DNA molecules are called homologous sequences. During the annotation process, ORFs are compared to hundreds of thousands of known proteins to look for sequence

CHAPTER 8



TRANSCRIPTION, TRANSLATION, AND BIOINFORMATICS

homology. ORFs with sufficient homology to known proteins can then be assigned putative function. Powerful
computer programs are available to carry out these analyses quickly (for example, visit the Joint Genome Institute
website).
If a query protein sequence does not show high levels of
similarity with known proteins, “annotation by function”
can be assigned when a protein domain exhibits characteristics or motifs similar to proteins of known function.
For example, periodic hydrophobic regions may indicate a
membrane protein, or an amino acid sequence (or motif)
matching those of known ATPases may suggest a similar function for the query protein. Annotation by function provides an extremely valuable starting point toward
unraveling a protein’s function, but biological validation is
required for confirmation.
Genes encoding transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs do
not encode proteins but can be identified because of the
conservation of these sequences across vast phylogenetic
distances. The results of annotation can be represented in
many different forms. Figure 8.35 shows a commonly used

method of presenting the results—namely, a circular display map (in this case chromosome I of the Gram-negative pathogen Vibrio vulnificus). Genes are color-coded by
their predicted function. V. vulnificus causes lethal blood
or wound infections associated with eating, or catching,
raw shellfish. Knowing the sequence of V. vulnificus helps
identify which genes are associated with disease.

Homologs, Orthologs, and Paralogs

Homologies found between genes or proteins suggest an evolutionary relatedness. Genes or proteins that are homologous
(homologs) probably evolved from a common ancestral gene.
Homologous genes or proteins can be classified as either
orthologous or paralogous. Orthologous genes (orthologs)
have functions essentially the same but occur in two or more
different species. For example, the gene for glutamine synthase (gltB) in E. coli is orthologous to gltB in Vibrio cholerae
and to gltB in the Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis.
Paralogous genes (paralogs) arise by duplication within the
same species (or progenitor) but evolve to carry out different

functions (Fig. 8.36). For example, genes encoding type III
protein secretion systems, which export virulence proteins,
have evolved from paralogous genes encoding flagellar biogenesis. The two sets of genes share a common ancestor but
have since evolved completely different functions (in this case,
secretion and motility). Paralogous genes are maintained in a
microbial genome because their distinct functions contribute
to the organism’s adaptive potential. Duplicate genes of identical function usually result in loss of one copy or the other by
degenerative evolution (see Chapter 9).
Many computer programs and resources used to analyze
DNA and protein sequences are freely available on the Web.
Here are some useful programs. You can find the program
by simply querying for it in any search engine.






BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool), by the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI),
compares a sequence of interest with all other DNA or
protein sequences deposited in sequence databases.

1. Gene A in species w is
duplicated to produce two
copies of A.

2. With time, the two copies

These genes are paralogous
and likely have evolved
different functions.



ExPASy (Expert Protein Analysis System) contains
many molecular tools, including Swiss-Prot, the definitive index of known proteins.
Joint Genome Institute Genome Portal has compiled
known genome sequences of microbes and eukaryotes.

Some of these programs are designed to align DNA
sequences or deduced protein sequences from different species. The goal can be to identify genetic relatedness between
species or assign function of a gene or protein. The relatedness between species is best determined by aligning DNA
sequences (discussed in Section 17.3). To assign function to a
newly sequenced gene, it is best to compare protein products
rather than the DNA sequence. Recall that one amino acid
can be encoded by more than one DNA codon. For instance,
a DNA strand (nontemplate) encoding the peptide Ala-LeuSer could be 5′ GCT CCT TCC or 5′ GCA CCG TCA. It
is easier to see the homology using the deduced peptide. On
the other hand, not all genes encode proteins. Prime examples
are the genes encoding stable ribosomal RNA molecules. The
DNA sequences for these rRNAs are highly conserved across
species, and their similarities reveal homology even among the
three ancestral domains (Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya).

Note:

As first mentioned in Section 8.3, do not confuse template and nontemplate strands of DNA for a given gene. The template strand, read 3′ to 5′ by RNA polymerase, is transcribed to
make the 5′-to-3′ RNA transcript. The nontemplate DNA strand,
also called the sense strand, has the same sequence as the RNA
transcript, with the substitution of T’s for U’s.

A word of caution: It is enticing to make definitive proclamations about gene or protein function based on the computer analysis of a DNA sequence. As good as a prediction
may seem, it is only a prediction—a well-educated guess. Biochemical confirmation of function must be made, if possible. Nevertheless, the predictions we can make are powerful.
In one recent example, a metabolic model was constructed
for the Gram-positive anaerobe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a major member of the human intestinal microbiome
(Fig. 8.37). This organism has anti-inflammatory properties
and produces a major energy source, butyrate, used by epithelial cells lining the large intestine. The bioinformatically

310

generated model was used to design a defined minimal
medium that would grow the organism. The defined medium
had several amino acid and vitamin growth factors added
because genes encoding their synthetic pathways were missing from the bacterium. The organism can now be grown in
defined media. This is an example of what has been called
functional genomics. Functional genomics is an integrative
process in which bioinformatic approaches enable scientists
to make predictions about function for a set of genes and
then test those predictions experimentally.

specifically degrades a sulfonated polysaccharide, porphyran, present in edible marine red algae (seaweed). The team
performed a bioinformatic BLAST analysis looking for
this enzyme in other species and discovered that all orthologs of porphyranase, except one, were encoded by marine
microbes. This makes sense because the biological source
of the substrate is found in the sea.
The one exception was Bacteroides plebeius, a human
gut microbe found only in Japanese individuals. Metagenomic studies found no examples of a porphyranase gene
in gut microbiota from North American or French individuals, or from any terrestrial source. Why the Japanese?
Curiously, red seaweed, known as nori, is a common food
in Japan, and the only source of the porphyran substrate for
this CAZyme. Sequence analysis of the B. plebeius genome
showed that this human intestinal microbe received an
unusual set of genes from a marine bacterium, probably by
horizontal gene transfer. One of these was the porphyranase CAZyme gene. Horizontal gene transfer is discussed
in Sections 7.1 and 9.6. Figure 8.38 shows the presentday sequence homologies between genes transferred to the
ancestor of B. plebeius from ancestors of the marine bacteria
Z. galactanivorans and Microscilla species. These data support the idea of horizontal transfer.
How might Japanese gut bacteria have acquired the
marine microbe’s porphyranase gene? In the eighth century, the Japanese government accepted seaweed as a form
of payment, suggesting that seaweed was very important in
Japanese culture. The authors propose that consumption
of red seaweed with its attendant marine bacteria containing porphyranase is the likely route by which the gene was
transferred to the gut microbe. The gene, now part of the
Japanese intestinal microbiome, enables humans to digest
the porphyran polysaccharide in red seaweed.

Bioinformatics and the

Bioinformatic analysis has contributed much to our understanding of the human microbiome, including its formation. One interesting example comes from a study of
carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes)—enzymes that
humans need to digest complex polysaccharides. Oddly, the
genes encoding these enzymes are not found in the human
genome but are present in the Gram-negative anaerobe
Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, a prominent member of the
human intestinal microbiota. Recently, a new CAZyme

Antibiotics and evolution. Streptococcus pneumoniae produces invasive disease such as pneumonia but also causes
recurrent ear infections. The most recent ear infection strain
will contain genes incorporated from earlier strains. JanWillem Veening found that antibiotics may stimulate this
evolution. S. pneumoniae takes up DNA from dead cells via
transformation, a process initiated by competence genes located near the replication origin. Antimicrobials that stall replication forks but allow initiation can increase copy number
(gene dosage) and expression of origin-proximal genes. Veening showed that a sublethal dose of 6-(p-hydroxyphenylazo)uracil (HPUra), which reversibly binds DNA polymerase III, will
stall replication forks and trigger expression of competenceregulated gene ssbB-gfp (green cells). Thus, some antibiotics
may stimulate in vivo pneumococcal evolution by activating
transformation.

How might gene dosage–induced
competence enhance evolution during
Streptococcus pneumoniae infections?
Many types of stress, including some
antibiotics, cause gene dosage–induced
competence in S. pneumoniae. Because
humans are often co-colonized by multiple pneumococcal strains, competence
and DNA uptake can help one strain
acquire resistance and virulence factors from others. Circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that gene dosage–induced
competence plays a very important role for successful pneumococcal carriage. It will be interesting to see whether other
key regulators located close to the origin of replication in the
pneumococcus, or in other bacteria, are affected by gene dosage and how the cell’s physiology changes in response.

9.1 Mosaic Genomes and Gene Transfer

Are there potential applications for your findings?
Antibiotics that stall replication elongation include the
commonly used fluoroquinolones. Our work suggests that
physicians should, whenever possible, treat pneumococcal infections with alternative antibiotics that do not activate competence, like beta-lactam antibiotics. In addition,
we are trying to identify novel compounds that can inhibit
competence development. Such compounds might be used
together with existing antibiotics to reduce the spread of
antibiotic resistance.

PART 2



GENES AND GENOMES

We often think of meaningful evolution as having to take
place over thousands if not millions of years. But that is not
always so. One striking example involves the pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, which causes serious lung infections in
any age group, and also recurrent ear infections in infants.
A team of researchers headed by Fen Hu and Garth Erhlich
(Drexel University) found convincing evidence of evolution
in a strain of S. pneumoniae isolated from an 8-month-old
child stricken with recurrent ear infections over 7 months.
Genome sequences of strains isolated during separate bouts
revealed 16 distinct recombination events leading from
the earliest to the latest isolate. During her short life, the
child had been colonized by multiple strains of pneumococcus that readily exchanged DNA via transformation. As
the Current Research Highlight suggests, the high level of
horizontal gene transfer was likely influenced by antibiotic
treatments. The resultant gene transfers allowed the species
to quickly evolve and cause recurrent disease.
Two other scientists, John Sullivan and Clive Ronson from
New Zealand, witnessed microbial evolution taking place in
soil within a mere decade. These researchers were studying
the microbe Mesorhizobium loti, a symbiotic bacterial species
that forms nitrogen-fixing nodules on plant roots. Genes
encoding symbiosis are located as a group on the mesorhizobial chromosome. In addition to these symbiotic rhizobia,
there are many nonsymbiotic species that are incapable of
forming root nodules. In a remarkable experiment, Sullivan
and Ronson inoculated a single strain of M. loti into an area
of land devoid of natural nodulating rhizobia. Seven years
later, they discovered that the area contained many genetically diverse symbiotic mesorhizobia now able to nodulate
the flowering plant Lotus corniculatus. These microbes did
not exist before the experiment. The 500-kb genome segment encoding symbiosis had somehow made its way from
M. loti into these other bacteria—essentially generating new
species. How did this happen so quickly?
In Chapter 9 we address the mechanisms that mediate
transient, as well as heritable, DNA movements between species. Next we describe the competing processes of mutagenesis and mutation repair required for self-preservation and
evolutionary change. We close the chapter by explaining
how all these processes collaborate over millennia to remodel
genomes and build biological diversity. The consequences of
gene flow during evolution will be discussed in Chapter 17.

9.1

Mosaic Genomes and
Gene Transfer

Genomic analysis shows that over millennia, microbes undergo
extensive gene loss and gain. Archaea, for example, arose from
a common eukaryotic-archaeal phylogenetic branch and, as a
result, possess many traits in common with eukaryotes, such

as the structure and function of their DNA and RNA polymerases. However, many archaeal genes whose products are
involved with intermediary metabolism look purely bacterial.
In fact, 37% of the proteins found in the archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii are found in all three domains—Archaea,
Eukarya, and Bacteria. Another 26% are otherwise found only
among bacteria, while a mere 5% are confined to archaea and
eukaryotes. Archaea, then, enjoy a mixed heritage.
Another surprise arising from bioinformatic studies is
the mosaic nature of the E. coli genome and, indeed, of
all microbial genomes. Though we have intensively studied E. coli for over 100 years, we now find that the organism’s DNA is rife with pathogenicity islands, fitness islands,
inversions, deletions (when compared to similar species),
paralogous genes, and orthologous genes. How did all this
genomic blending happen? The answer appears to involve
heavy gene traffic between species (horizontal gene transfer), recombination events occurring within a species, and
a variety of mutagenic and DNA repair strategies. All of
these processes accelerated natural selection, where trial
and error shaped genome content.

The Discovery of Horizontal
Gene Transfer

In 1928, a perceptive English medical officer, Frederick
Griffith (1879–1941), found that he could kill mice by injecting them with dead cells of a virulent pneumococcus (Streptococcus pneumoniae, a cause of pneumonia), together with live
cells of a nonvirulent mutant. Even more extraordinary was
that he recovered live, virulent bacteria from the dead mice.
Were the dead bacteria brought back to life? Unfortunately,
Griffith was killed by a German bomb during an air raid on
London in 1941 and never learned the answer.
In a landmark series of experiments published in 1944,
Oswald Avery (1877–1955), Colin MacLeod (1909–1972),
and Maclyn McCarty (1911–2005) proved that Griffith’s
experiment was not a case of resurrecting dead cells.
Instead, DNA released from dead cells of the virulent strain
entered into the harmless living strain of S. pneumoniae—
an event that transformed the live strain into a killer. The
process of importing free DNA into bacterial cells is now
known as transformation.
Transformation provided the first clue that gene
exchange can occur in microorganisms. Why do bacteria
carry out this and other forms of gene transfer? Genome
comparisons show that the fundamental purpose of bacterial gene transfer is to acquire genes that might be useful as the environment changes. The natural movement of
genes between species or genera is called horizontal gene
transfer or lateral gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer
between cells differs from vertical gene transfer, which is
the generational passing of genes from parent to offspring

CHAPTER 9



GENE TRANSFER, MUTATIONS, AND GENOME EVOLUTION

(as in cell division). If horizontal acquisition of a gene system improves the competitiveness of the cell, the new genes
will be retained and the descendants will have evolved into
a new kind of organism.
Before we can discuss how bacterial genomes evolve,
we need to understand the various gene exchange mechanisms available to them. Following the explanations of gene
exchange, we will discuss the processes that incorporate newly
acquired DNA into genomes (for example, recombination).

Transformation of Naked DNA

How do live bacteria import DNA from dead bacteria? Many
bacteria can import DNA fragments and plasmids released
from nearby dead cells via the process of transformation.
Natural transformation requires specific protein complexes
called transformasomes. Organisms in which transformation is a natural part of the growth cycle include Grampositive bacteria like Streptococcus and Bacillus, as well as
Gram-negative species such as Haemophilus and Neisseria. At
least 82 species have been shown to be naturally competent.
Other bacteria, such as E. coli and Salmonella, do not
possess the equipment needed to import DNA naturally.
They require artificial manipulations to drive DNA into
their cells. These laboratory techniques include perturbing

the membrane by chemical (CaCl2) and electrical (electroporation) methods. CaCl2 alters the membrane, making
these cells chemically competent so that DNA can pass.
Electroporation, on the other hand, uses a brief electrical
pulse to “shoot” DNA across the membrane.
Why do species such as Neisseria undergo natural transformation? First, species that indiscriminately import
DNA may use the transformed DNA as food. Second, the
more finicky species that transform only compatible DNA
sequences may use DNA released from dead compatriots to repair their own damaged genomes. Note that the
transformation process is random. A cell does not choose
which genes to import or keep. Finally, transformation can
influence evolution, enabling species to adjust to new environments by acquiring new genes from other species via
horizontal gene transfer. Transformation may have enabled
pathogens such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the cause of gonorrhea, to acquire genes whose protein products now help
the organism evade the host immune system.

GENES AND GENOMES

protein that captures extracellular DNA floating in the environment, plus proteins that form a transmembrane pore. A
nuclease degrades one strand of a double-stranded DNA
molecule while pulling the other strand intact through the
pore and into the cell. Once inside, the strand can be incorporated into the chromosome by recombination, a process
we will discuss in Section 9.2.
Once the transformasome is assembled, the cell is competent, meaning that it can import free DNA fragments
and incorporate them into its genome by recombination.
What triggers growth phase–dependent competence?
For some Gram-positive bacteria, competence for transformation is generated by a chemical conversation
(quorum sensing; see Sections 4.5 and 10.5) that takes
place between members of the culture. Every individual
in a growing population produces and secretes a small,
15- to 20-amino-acid peptide, generically called competence factor (CF), that progressively accumulates in the
medium until it induces a genetic program that makes the
population competent (Fig. 9.1, step 1). The sequence
of the CF peptide is unique to each species, as are the
specifics of the induction process. For Streptococcus pneumoniae, the level of CF in the medium increases (step 2)
as the population increases—that is, as the cell density
increases.
Above a certain concentration threshold, competence
factor is able to bind to a sensory protein built into the
cell membrane (ComD for S. pneumoniae). This binding
begins what is called a phosphorylation cascade (the passing of a phosphate group from one protein to another;
eTopic 4.1). In the competence phosphorylation cascade,
the sensory protein phosphorylates itself using ATP and
then passes the phosphate to a cytoplasmic regulatory
protein, ComE, which stimulates expression of a novel
sigma factor, SigH (Fig. 9.1, step 3). Sigma H is specifically used to transcribe genes encoding the transformasome (step 4). The protein products of these genes are
assembled at the membrane, and the cell becomes competent (step 5).
Why would organisms regulate transformation competence by quorum sensing? One hypothesis holds that
cells are unlikely to encounter stray DNA when growing
in dilute natural environments such as ponds, where other
bacteria are scarce. So, in this situation, why waste energy
making the transformasome? When these same cells are
growing at high density, as in a biofilm, they are more
likely to encounter DNA released from dying neighbors.
This is DNA they could use to repair their own damaged
genomes, to consume as food, or to sample for a new survival mechanism, should the DNA come from a different species present in a biofilm consortium. Regulation by
quorum sensing would ensure that the transformasome

would not form until there was a good chance that free
foreign DNA was available.
Thought Question

9.1 Figure 9.1; illustrates the process of transformation in

Streptococcus pneumoniae. Will a mutant of Streptococcus
lacking ComD be able to transform DNA?

Gram-negative species transform DNA without competence factors. Gram-negative species capable of natural

transformation do not appear to make competence factors. Either they are always competent, like Neisseria, or
they become competent when starved (for example, Haemophilus). Competence development does not depend on
cell-cell communication. Gram-negative organisms have
a cytoplasmic membrane transformasome similar to that
employed by Gram-positive microbes, but Gram-negative bacteria also must overcome an outer membrane barrier to DNA importation. Neisseria species, for example,
appear to import DNA through a system paralogous to
type IV pilus assembly (discussed in Section 8.5). Type
IV pili reversibly assemble and disassemble at the cell surface, expanding and contracting as a result. This happens
constantly during the growth of a culture and can help
cells move across solid surfaces. During transformation in
species of Neisseria, disassembly of a pilus is thought to
drag transforming DNA into the cell and across the two
membranes.
In another departure from the Gram-positive example, transformation in species of Haemophilus and Neisseria is species and sequence specific, thereby limiting gene
exchange between different genera. Specificity is due to
particular sequences in DNA that are recognized by part
of the uptake apparatus. However, not all Gram-negative competence systems display such specificity; Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, a lung pathogen, is able to take up
DNA from any source at very high frequency. This is possible because the DNA-binding part of its transformation
system does not need to recognize a specific nucleotide
sequence.

Gene Transfer by Conjugation

Conjugation, sometimes erroneously called “bacterial sex,” requires cell-cell contact typically initiated by
a special pilus protruding from a donor cell (Fig. 9.2).
The pilus can also dramatically contribute to biofilm
formation (eTopic 9.1). Conjugation occurs in many species of bacteria and archaea, even in hyperthermophiles

such as Sulfolobus species. In nature, mixed-species biofilms are thought to enable DNA transfer between different species, albeit at a low frequency. As for the
mechanism of DNA transfer by conjugation, most species
use type IV–like protein secretion systems because a protein is transferred along with DNA (as described next and
in Section 8.5).
In the case of the Gram-negative E. coli, the tip of the
specialized plasmid-encoded sex pilus attaches to a receptor on the recipient cell and then contracts, drawing the
two cells closer. The two cell envelopes fuse and generate a
conjugation complex, through which single-stranded DNA
passes from donor to recipient. The conjugation complex is
similar to the transformation complex.
Bacterial conjugation requires the presence of special
transferable plasmids that usually contain all the genes
needed for pilus formation and DNA export. In some
cases, plasmids can also contain genes encoding antibiotic
resistance. A well-studied, transferable plasmid in E. coli is
called fertility factor, or F factor (Fig. 9.3 ). F factor
can transfer itself to another recipient cell, but if it integrates into the chromosome of its host, it can also transfer host genes. To carry out plasmid replication and DNA



319

transfer, F factor uses two replication origins, oriV and
oriT, located at different positions on the plasmid. The
origin oriV is used to replicate and maintain the plasmid
in nonconjugating cells, whereas oriT is used only to replicate DNA during DNA transfer. F factor also contains
several tra genes, whose protein products carry out the
DNA transfer process.
Conjugation begins with cell-cell contact between a
donor F+ cell that carries the plasmid and a recipient F– cell
(Fig. 9.3, step 1). Formation of a fused membrane conjugation conduit (step 2) triggers synthesis of an F factor–
encoded helicase/endonuclease (also called TraI or relaxase)
that nicks the phosphodiester backbone at the nic site in
oriT (step 3). TraI forms a relaxosome complex with other
F factor–encoded proteins. The relaxosome unwinds donor
double-stranded DNA and begins the transfer process. The
blowup at step 3 in Figure 9.3 shows a model of the multifactor relaxosome complex called a conjugation bridge.
The translocated TraI relaxase remains bound to the 5′ end
of the nicked strand, and the 5′ DNA-protein complex is
transferred through a pore protein in the recipient. The
translocated relaxase and the 5′ end of the strand remain
in the membrane, while the rest of the strand is transferred
through the pore. The intact circular strand remains in the
donor. DNA polymerase III (Pol III) is then recruited to
oriT in the donor, where replication begins (step 4). In contrast to bidirectional replication, which is used to duplicate the chromosome, replication for conjugative transfer
occurs unidirectionally, by rolling-circle replication (step 5)
(see Section 7.4).
DNA polymerase III synthesis of the replacement strand
in the donor cell drives movement of the transferred strand
through the pore. The polymerase uses the untransferred
intact circular strand as a template (see Fig. 9.3, steps 4
and 5).
Once the transfer is complete, the relaxase re-ligates the
5′ end it was holding to the 3′ tail of the transferred strand
in the recipient. Thus, the last portion of F factor moved
to the recipient is oriT. Once circularized, the plasmid replicates and the F – recipient cell becomes a new F+ donor
cell (Fig. 9.3, step 6). Ultimately, the conjugation complex
spontaneously comes apart, and the membranes seal. This
transfer process is very quick, taking less than five minutes
to transfer the entire 110-kb F factor.
Is it possible for two donors to exchange DNA with each
other? The answer is generally no; donors have mechanisms
in place to prevent such exchange. For example, a membrane protein encoded by the F factor will inhibit formation of a conjugation complex with another donor that
possesses the same protein. This mechanism prevents the
pointless transfer of a plasmid to a cell that already has that
plasmid.

F + cell

The F-factor plasmid can integrate into the chromosome.

An F-factor plasmid can remain a plasmid or can be integrated
into the chromosome of the recipient cell (Fig. 9.4). Integration of the plasmid into the genome involves recombination
between two circular DNA duplexes—a process explained in
Section 9.2. Because the plasmid can exist in extrachromosomal and integrated forms, it is sometimes called an episome
(epi, Greek for “over”; and some from “chromosome”).
A strain with the F factor integrated into the chromosome is called an Hfr (high-frequency recombination)

strain. The strain is called “high-frequency” because
every cell is capable of transferring chromosomal DNA
to an F – cell. Very few cells with an integrated F factor
are present in an F+ culture. A cell with F factor inserted
into the chromosome is capable of transferring all or part
of the chromosome into a recipient cell. Essentially, the
entire chromosome becomes the F factor. However, the
integrated F factor is actually the last bit of DNA transferred during Hfr conjugation. Because it takes nearly
100 minutes to transfer the entire E. coli chromosome

(as opposed to only 5 minutes for the free F plasmid),
the integrated F factor is rarely transferred before the
conjugation bridge breaks, so the recipient almost never
becomes an F+ or Hfr cell. How Hfr conjugation was used
in the past to map E. coli genes is described in eTopic 9.2.
Today, rapid DNA sequencing is used to map genes in any
organism. Nevertheless, conjugation remains important
for evolution and as a tool for scientists to move genes
between species.
An integrated F factor can excise from the chromosome.

Another type of gene shuffl ing can occur when an integrated F factor reverses course and excises from the chromosome via host recombination mechanisms. The F factor
is usually excised completely and restored to its original
form. Occasionally, however, it is excised along with some
neighboring DNA from the host chromosome, yielding
a product that remains an F-factor plasmid but also contains some chromosomal DNA. The derivative F plasmid
containing host DNA is called an F-prime (F′) plasmid or
F-prime (F′) factor (Fig. 9.5).

In contrast to the Hfr transfer of chromosomal genes,
genes hitchhiking on an F′ plasmid do not have to recombine into the recipient chromosome to be maintained. The
extra genes can be expressed as part of the F′ plasmid. The
resultant strain is called a “partial diploid” because it contains two copies of those few genes—one set on the chromosome, the other on the F′ factor. Partial diploids are
useful to the cell because the second copy of the gene can
be the raw material that evolves into a new gene. Partial
diploids are useful to geneticists because they can reveal
whether a mutant allele of a gene is dominant over a normal
(wild-type) allele. Partial diploids can also help geneticists
understand gene organization.
Many different types of plasmids can be found in the
microbial world. Most are not transferable by themselves.
However, one group of plasmids that cannot transfer themselves can be mobilized if a transferable plasmid such as
F factor is also present in the same cell. Mobilizable plasmids usually contain an oriT-like DNA replication origin
recognized by the conjugation apparatus of the transferable
plasmid. As a result, when the transferable plasmid begins

way in which antibiotic resistance genes on plasmids called
R factors can be spread throughout a microbial population.
Note that not all mobilizable plasmids contain antibiotic
resistance genes.
Thought Question

9.2 Transfer of an F factor from an F+ cell to an F– cell

converts the recipient to F+. Why doesn’t transfer of an Hfr do
the same?

(Fig. 9.6B). Subsequent transfer, integration, and expression of the Ti plasmid in the plant cell genome trigger the
release of plant hormones that stimulate tumorous growth
of the plant. Plant cells within the tumor release amino acid
derivatives, called “opines,” that the microbe can then use
as a source of carbon and nitrogen. The unique mode of
action of A. tumefaciens has made this bacterium an indispensable tool for plant breeding and enables entirely new
(nonplant) genes to be engineered into crops (discussed in
Chapter 16).

Note:
Agrobacterium practices interdomain conjugation. You

may be surprised to learn that some bacteria can actually transfer genes across biological domains. One striking
example is Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which causes crown
gall disease in plants (Fig. 9.6A). This Gram-negative plant
pathogen contains a tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid that can
be transferred via conjugation to plant cells. The bacteria detect and swim toward phenolic compounds released
from the wound of a damaged plant where they attach

Conjugation in bacteria and archaea is mechanistically
different from conjugation among eukaryotic microbes. Some
eukaryotic microbes exchange nuclei through a structure, called
a conjugation bridge, very different from that of bacteria (see
Chapter 20).

unnecessary. Thus, bacteriophages can accidentally move
bacterial genes between cells as an offshoot of the phage
life cycle (see Section 6.4 and eTopic 7.2). The process in
which bacteriophages carry payloads of host DNA from
one cell to another is known as transduction. There are
two basic types of transduction: generalized and specialized. Generalized transduction can take any gene from
a donor cell and transfer it to a recipient cell, whereas
specialized transduction (also known as restricted transduction) can transfer only a few closely linked genes
between cells.
How does transduction happen? Bacteriophages capable of generalized transduction have trouble distinguishing their own DNA from that of the host when attempting
to package DNA into their capsids, so pieces of bacterial
host DNA accidentally become packaged in the phage capsid instead of phage DNA. In the case of Salmonella P22
phage, the packaging system recognizes a certain DNA
sequence on P22 DNA called a pac site. During rollingcircle replication, P22 DNA forms long concatemers containing many P22 genomes arranged in tandem. The pac
site defines the ends of the phage genome, marking where
the packaging system cuts the P22 DNA and starts packaging DNA into the next empty phage head. However,
certain DNA sequences on the Salmonella chromosome
also “look” like pac sites. As a result, the packaging system sometimes mistakenly packages host DNA instead of
phage DNA.
The result of this mistake is that 1% of the phage
particles in any population of P22 contain no phage DNA
but carry host DNA plucked from around the chromosome
(Fig. 9.7). The phages that carry host DNA are called
transducing particles. Any single transducing particle will
contain only one segment of host DNA, but different
particles in the phage population will contain different
segments of host DNA. When a transducing particle injects
its DNA into a cell, no new phages are made, but the hijacked
host DNA can recombine, or exchange, with sequences
in the host chromosome of the newly infected cell, thus
changing the genetic makeup of the recipient.

genes from one cell and move them to another? Norton
Zinder (1928–2012) first suspected that bacteriophages
could taxi chromosomal DNA between cells. To test this
idea, he grew Salmonella in two tubes separated by a fine
filter through which viruses could pass, but not bacteria.
The experiments, reported in 1966, showed that a filterable agent, or virus, could carry genetic material between
bacterial strains; direct contact between bacteria was

9.3 A prophage genome embedded in the chromosome of
a lysogenic cell will prevent the replication of any new phage
DNA (from the same phage group) that has infected the
cell. By preventing the replication of superinfecting phage
DNA, the prophage genome protects itself from destruction by lysis. Is a lysogen also protected from generalized
transduction carried out by a similar phage? For example,
can a P22 lysogen of Salmonella be transduced by P22
grown on a different strain of Salmonella? Explain why or
why not.

 Generalized transduction.
Generalized
transduction by phage vectors can move any segment of donor
chromosome to a recipient cell. The number of genes transferred
in any one phage capsid is limited, however, to what can fit in the
phage head.

Specialized (restricted) transduction is a phagemediated gene transfer mechanism similar to the F′
factors described previously. In contrast to generalized
transduction, specialized transduction can move only
a limited number of host genes. E. coli phage lambda
(discussed in Chapter 11) provides the classic example of specialized transduction. Lambda phage DNA
is linear when it first enters the cell; then it circularizes at cohesive ends called cos sites. Next, a small
DNA sequence in lambda called attP can recombine
with a similar host DNA sequence (called attB) located
between the gal (galactose catabolism) and bio (biotin
synthesis) genes on the E. coli chromosome (Fig. 9.8,
step 1). This process, carried out by the phage integrase
protein, produces a chromosome with an integrated
phage genome, referred to as a prophage, flanked by
chimeric att sites called attL and attR. These sites are
called “chimeric” because each one is made half from
the bacterial and half from the phage att sites. Prophage DNA remains latent until something happens to
the cell to activate it.
Specialized transduction begins with the reactivation of this prophage DNA, often by DNA damage.
Usually, the phage enzymes that excise the lambda
DNA do so precisely. The chromosome and viral DNAs
are restored to their native states. The viral DNA will
then replicate and make more phage particles containing normal phage DNA. On rare occasions, however,
improper excision (mediated by host recombination
enzymes) can take place between host DNA sequences
that lie adjacent to the phage insertion site (attB in
Fig. 9.8, step 2) and similar DNA sequences within the
prophage. Improper excision yields a virus that will lack
a few viral genes (tail genes missing in Fig. 9.8, step 3)
but will include host genes lying adjacent to the phage
attachment site (the galactose utilization gene gal in
step 3). With some phages, the specialized transducing
particles can replicate unaided. However, in Figure 9.8
the result is a defective, specialized transducing phage
DNA (lambda dgal, or λdgal). Specialized transducing
phage particles that are defective cannot replicate by
themselves, but require the presence of a helper phage
to supply missing gene products.
Once formed, specialized transducing phages can
deliver the hybrid DNA molecule to a new recipient
cell. This is the transduction process. Once in that
cell, the phage DNA can integrate into the host attB
site, carrying the donor host gene(s) with it (Fig. 9.8,
steps 4 and 5). The result will be another partial
diploid situation in which the new recipient contains two copies of a host gene: one originally present on its chromosome, and one brought in by the
transducing DNA.

CRISPR Interference: Adaptive
Immunity of Bacteria and Archaea

One of the most formidable wars on Earth is waged by
phages and viruses against Bacteria and Archaea, respectively. Phage predators outnumber their prokaryotic prey
10:1 and destroy between 4% and 50% of prokaryotic
life-forms. In an attempt to save themselves, Bacteria and
Archaea have developed intriguing defense systems. One
system masks receptors for phage attachment. A second
uses enzymes to digest invading phage DNA while strategically protecting their own (see the preceding discussion). The third is an adaptive system, first introduced in
Chapter 6, called CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced
short palindromic repeats), in which an organism that manages to survive a phage attack captures a piece of the invader’s genome and wields it as defense against future attack.
Nearly 50% of Bacteria and 85% of Archaea possess one or
more of these CRISPR loci.

CRISPR anatomy. A CRISPR locus on a bacterial chromosome (Fig. 9.12) is composed of short direct-repeat
sequences (averaging 32 bp) separated by spacers of uniform
length (20–72 bp, depending on the species). Although the
sequences of direct repeats are, by defi nition, nearly identical, the sequences of the spacers are different from one
another. Note that repeats and spacers do not encode proteins. Near these sequence clusters lie CRISPR-associated
gene families (cas) that do encode proteins. A single species can have one or more of these cas genes, as well as
cas subtype genes (called cse for E. coli). Some CRISPR
loci also contain a set of genes called the R AMP (repeatassociated mysterious proteins) module, which includes the
gene encoding a putative polymerase.
CRISPR function. Clues about the function of the variable

spacer regions were uncovered using bioinformatics, which
revealed that some spacers bear sequence homology to bacteriophage or plasmid genes. It turned out that cells harboring these spacers were immune to the corresponding
invaders, but related species lacking these spacers were susceptible. Thus, CRISPR is perceived as a primitive microbial immune system.
How does a CRISPR locus work? Bacteria with a CRISPR
locus acquire new spacers by incorporating a piece of an

invader’s DNA (Fig. 9.13A; spacer acquisition). One or more
CRISPR Cas proteins may cleave part of an invading phage
genome and integrate it as the lead spacer in the CRISPR
region. It is then thought that the CRISPR locus is transcribed starting from an upstream leader sequence. The RNA
transcript is then cleaved and trimmed (processed) by some of
the Cas products into small RNAs composed of a single spacer
sequence (crRNA, also called guide RNA) (Fig. 9.13B;
crRNA processing stage). Each guide RNA associates with
Cas proteins to form a riboprotein complex that binds to a
homologous sequence from an infecting phage or plasmid
and directs cleavage of the foreign DNA. The process may
be aided by RAMP module proteins (Fig. 9.13C; effector
stage). As a result, the infected cell is spared destruction.
The CRISPR system has also been modified for in vivo
genetic engineering purposes (see Chapter 12). Guide RNA
molecules can be designed to direct Cas nucleases to cleave
almost any in vivo DNA sequence. CRISPR-Cas technology has gained widespread use for modifying eukaryotic
genes. Emmanuelle Charpentier, currently at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Germany, and Jennifer Doudna at UC Berkeley (Fig. 9.14) played integral
roles in deciphering the CRISPR mechanism.
Novel CRISPR functions. A number of studies have now

shown that CRISPR loci contribute to cell function
beyond providing immunity from phage infections. One
novel function of CRISPR loci, discovered from work in
George O’Toole’s Dartmouth laboratory, may be to banish
a lysogenic cell from a biofi lm, so that phage produced by
the lysogen cannot kill the rest of the biofi lm community.
Figure 9.15 demonstrates this phenomenon with Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Cleavage

Figure 9.15A shows that a lysogenized (infected) cell of
P. aeruginosa does not form a biofilm. If this lysogen were
a single cell among many biofilm-producing nonlysogens,
then it would not associate with the biofilm. This self-exile
saves the biofilm from infection, should the phage become
active. The CRISPR locus is essential for this loss, since
disruption of the CRISPR or several cas genes restores a
lysogen’s ability to form biofilms (Fig. 9.15B). Introducing a wild-type copy of the gene (Fig. 9.15C) into the
mutant cell once again prevents biofilm formation. Thus,
a mechanism in which an infected cell would impose selfexile would save the population. The mechanism itself
starts with Cas3 interacting with a spacer derived from the

DNA repair system (described later), which triggers the
expression of some prophage genes that kill the cell.
Another novel function for a CRISPR-Cas system was
discovered in the lung pathogen Legionella pneumophila,
a Gram-negative bacillus that causes a pneumonia known
as Legionnaire’s disease. In 2015, twelve people in New
York City died during an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease after inhaling L. pneumophila–contaminated aerosols
emitted from a hotel rooftop air-conditioning system. The
pathogen persists in these systems by infecting amebas that
inhabit the water-cooling towers. Nicholas Cianciotto and
Felizza Gunderson at Northwestern University discovered
that intracellular L. pneumophila highly expresses several cas
genes when infecting amebas. The scientists also found that
by knocking out one of the cas genes (cas2), they could significantly limit the ability of Legionella to infect amebas.
Other components of the CRISPR system did not have
this effect. The authors hypothesize that Cas2, which is an
RNase, could modify the level or structure of another RNA
that influences or encodes factors needed for infection.
Thus, preventing cas2 expression could curtail the infection
of amebas and disrupt the pathogenesis of L. pneumophila.

Some bacteria can transfer DNA across phylogenetic

Transduction is the process whereby bacteriophages
transfer fragments of bacterial DNA from one bacterium to another. In generalized transduction, a phage

Restriction endonucleases protect bacteria from invasion by foreign DNA. Restriction-modification enzymes

GENES AND GENOMES

Recombination

Once a new piece of DNA enters a cell through one of the
gene exchange systems, what happens to it? The answer
depends on the nature of the acquired DNA. If the DNA is a
plasmid, capable of autonomous replication, it can coexist in
the cell separate from the host chromosome. If the DNA is
incapable of autonomous replication, however, then it may be
incorporated into the chromosome through recombination
or, as is usually the case, it may be degraded by nucleases.
Two DNA molecules in a single cell can recombine by
one of two main mechanisms: generalized or site-specific
recombination. Generalized recombination requires that
the two recombining molecules have a considerable stretch
of homologous DNA sequence. Site-specific recombination, on the other hand, requires very little sequence
homology between the recombining DNA molecules, but
it does require a short sequence (10–20 bp) recognized by
the recombination enzyme.

Generalized Recombination and RecA

Enzymes participating in generalized recombination are
able to align homologous stretches of DNA in two different DNA molecules and catalyze an exchange of strands.
The result can be a cointegrate molecule in which a single
recombination event (that is, a single crossover) joins the
two participating DNA molecules. For instance, when two
circular DNA molecules are joined by a single recombination event, the two molecules are added together and form
one large circular molecule (for an example, see Fig. 9.4). A
second crossover separated by some distance from the first,
however, will lead to an equal exchange of DNA in which
neither molecule increases in length.
Why is recombination advantageous? There are three
probable functions for generalized recombination in the
microbial cell:
■

Recombination probably fi rst evolved as an internal
method of DNA repair, useful to fi x mutations or restart
stalled replication forks. This role does not involve foreign DNA.

■

Cells with damaged chromosomes use DNA donated by
others of the same species to repair their damaged genes.

■

Recombination is part of a “self-improvement” program
that samples genes from other organisms for an ability to
enhance the competitive fitness of the cell.

The central, but by no means only, player in generalized recombination is a protein called RecA. RecA molecules are able to scan DNA molecules for homology and
align the homologous regions, forming a triplex DNA molecule, or synapse. Homologs of RecA are found in many
other species.

The clearest model of RecA-mediated recombination comes
from E. coli (Fig. 9.16 ). Before RecA can find homology
between two DNA molecules, the donor double-stranded
DNA molecule is converted to a single strand by the RecBCD
enzyme. The RecBCD complex enters at the end of a DNA
fragment and begins to unwind it (Fig. 9.16, steps 1 and
2). The complex changes activity when it encounters 8-bp
sequences called Chi (crossover hot-spot instigator) that are
scattered throughout most DNA molecules. RecBCD nicks
DNA at a Chi site and continues unwinding the strand. RecA
then loads onto the single strand as a filament (step 2).
When RecA finds homology between donor and recipient DNA (the minimum required is about 50 bp), the
donor single-stranded DNA invades the homologous
region in the double-stranded DNA recipient molecule and
displaces its like strand. The process is called strand invasion (Fig. 9.16, step 3). At this point, a single-strand crossover has been made. The single-strand crossover produces a
molecule with four double-stranded ends.
Other recombination proteins, RuvA and RuvB, assemble
at the crossover point and extend the invasion in a process
called “strand assimilation” or branch migration (Fig. 9.16,
step 4 and blowup). RuvAB proteins pull matched hybrid
strands in opposite directions, thereby extending the basepairing between homologous donor and recipient strands.
Ultimately, the end of the displaced recipient strand is
cleaved (Fig. 9.16, step 5) and ligated to the donor strand
(step 6). The resulting structure is known as a Holliday junction, after the scientist (Robin Holliday) who first proposed
it (step 7; also seen in the blowup). The final step is resolution
of the crossover Holliday junction. To visualize this, we mentally rotate the right half of the Holliday structure as shown
in Figure 9.16, step 7. RuvC protein cleaves across the junction (step 8), and the products are ligated to form a complete
crossover. The ligated product represents a true crossover. In
each case, notice that a small heteroduplex region is formed
in which one strand comes from the donor and the complementary region comes from the recipient.
If we were viewing the end result of transduction, where
the recipient is a circular chromosome and the donor is a
double-stranded linear fragment, the recombinant molecule would appear as shown in Figure 9.16, step 9. A
second crossover farther along the donor strand is then
required to maintain circular integrity of the recipient (step
10). This double crossover means that any genes residing
between the first and second crossovers are simultaneously
exchanged and are said to be genetically linked.
Thought Question

donor and an A– B – C– genotype recipient, 100 A+ recombinants were selected. Of those 100, 15% were also B+, while
75% were C+. Is gene B or gene C closer to gene A?

radiation-resistant species Deinococcus radiodurans, for example, does the exact opposite. Its RecA first binds dsDNA and
then searches ssDNA for homology. This inverse DNA strand
exchange accounts, in part, for the remarkable radiation
resistance of this microbe (read more about it in eTopic 9.3).

Site-Specific Recombination
Is RecA Independent

In contrast to generalized recombination mechanisms
that require RecA protein and can recombine any region
of the chromosome, site-specific recombination does not
utilize RecA and moves only a limited number of genes.
This form of recombination involves very short regions
of homology between donor and target DNA molecules.
Dedicated enzyme systems specifically recognize those
sequences and catalyze a crossover between them to produce a cointegrate molecule. The integration of phage
lambda, described earlier, is one example of site-specific
recombination involving a 15-bp att site and the integrase
enzyme (see Fig. 9.8).
Other examples of site-specific recombination are
flagellar phase variation in the pathogen Salmonella
enterica and phase variation in the expression of type
I pili in E. coli. In these systems, a segment of DNA is
inverted (flipped) at a low frequency, resulting in the onor-off regulation of adjacent gene expression. Phase variation is frequently employed by pathogens to evade the
host immune system by changing the expression of cellsurface proteins. For more on flagellar phase variation,
see Section 10.1.

Recombination is the process by which DNA sequences
can be exchanged between DNA molecules.
General recombination involves large regions of sequence
homology between recombining DNA molecules.
RecA protein mediates generalized recombination.
The extremely radiation-resistant Deinococcus radiodurans is thought to use RecA protein to patch together
homologous ends of fragmented DNA in a way that reconstructs the chromosome after extreme radiation damage.
Site-specific recombination requires little homology
between donor and recipient DNA molecules. Site-specific recombination enables phage DNA to integrate into
bacterial chromosomes and is a process that can turn on
or turn off certain genes, as in flagellar phase variation in
Salmonella.

9.3

Mutations

What are mutations, and how do they affect evolution?
Any permanent, heritable alteration in a DNA sequence,
whether harmful, beneficial, or neutral, is called a mutation. Two basic requirements are needed to produce a heritable mutation: Namely, there must be a change in the base
sequence, and the cell must fail to repair the change before
the next round of replication. Repair mechanisms will be
discussed in Section 9.4. Although it is tempting to think
that all mutations destroy a protein’s activity, this is not the
case. A given mutation may or may not affect the informational content or phenotype of the organism.
Mutations come in several different physical and structural forms:
■

A point mutation is a change in a single nucleotide
(Fig. 9.17A and B). Changing a purine to a different
purine or a pyrimidine to a different pyrimidine is called
a transition. Swapping a purine for a pyrimidine (or vice
versa) is a transversion.

■

Insertions and deletions involve, respectively, the
addition or subtraction of one or more nucleotides
(Fig. 9.17C and D), making the sequence either longer
or shorter than it was originally.

■

An inversion results when a fragment of DNA is flipped in
orientation relative to DNA on either side (Fig. 9.17E).

■

A reversion restores a sequence altered by mutation to
its original sequence.

Mutations can also be categorized into several informational classes (refer to Figure 8.10 for the genetic code).
Mutations that do not change the amino acid sequence of
a translated open reading frame (ORF) are called silent
mutations. For example, a point mutation changing TTT
to TTC in the sense DNA strand (corresponding to a UUUto-UUC codon change in mRNA) still codes for phenylalanine. Thus, even though the DNA sequence has changed,
the protein sequence remains the same (a synonymous substitution). However, if the UUU codon were changed to
UUA (a U-to-A transversion), then the protein would have
a leucine where a phenylalanine had been (see Fig. 9.17A).
This type of mutation is a missense mutation because the
amino acid sequence of the protein has changed. (Remember: RNA polymerase makes mRNA by reading the DNA
template strand, while the complementary, or sense, DNA
strand has the same sequence as the mRNA.)
The amino acid substitution resulting from a missense
mutation may or may not alter protein function. The outcome
depends on the structural importance of the original amino
acid and how close in structure the replacement amino acid is
to the original. Missense mutations result in either conservative amino acid replacements, in which the new amino acid

is structurally similar to the original (for example, leucine is
substituted for isoleucine), or nonconservative replacements,
in which a very different amino acid is substituted (for example, tyrosine for alanine). A missense change may decrease
or eliminate the activity of the protein (a loss-of-function
mutation), or it may make the protein more active. It could
even gain a new activity, such as an expanded substrate specificity or a completely different substrate specificity (these are
called gain-of-function mutations).
A mutation that eliminates function is known as a
knockout mutation (see Fig. 9.17B). Knockout mutations can include multiple-base insertions and deletions,
as well as nonsense mutations. A nonsense mutation is a
point mutation that changes an amino acid codon into a

translation termination codon—for example, UCA (serine) to UAA. The result will be a truncated protein most
likely lacking any function—another example of a knockout mutation. Typically, these defective, truncated proteins
are degraded by cellular proteases (see Section 8.4).
Insertions and deletions can alter the reading frame
of the DNA sequence (see Fig. 9.17C and D). Remarkable as it is, the ribosome simply reads RNA sequences one
codon at a time, stringing amino acids together in the process. It translates each codon “word” but cannot understand the overall protein “sentence.” It does not recognize
when bases have been added or removed through mutation; instead, it keeps reading the sequence in triplets. If
the number of bases inserted or deleted is not a multiple of
three, the ribosome will read the wrong triplets. The result
is a frameshift mutation, which produces a garbled protein “sentence.” Frameshift mutations often cause the ribosome to encounter a premature stop codon, originally in a
different reading frame. If the insertion or deletion involves
multiples of three bases, the reading frame is not changed,
but one or more amino acids are added or removed.
An inversion mutation flips a DNA sequence (see
Fig. 9.17E). Imagine the sequence highlighted in the figure rotating 180° while the adjacent sequences (in black)
remain right where they are. The rotation would retain the
5′-to-3′ polarity in the new molecule. But if the inversion
occurred within a gene, it would likely change the codons
in the area and alter the resulting protein. What Figure 9.17E shows is a small inversion; however, inversions
often involve large tracts of DNA encompassing several
genes. If an entire gene with its promoter inverts, the gene
will likely remain functional, and its encoded protein may
very well still be made. Inversions occur within a genome
as a result of recombination events between similar DNA
sequences or as a consequence of mobile genetic elements
jumping between different areas of a genome.
Mutations can affect both the genotype and the phenotype of an organism. The genotype of an organism reflects
its genomic sequences. Regardless of whether a mutation
causes a change in a biochemical trait (phenotype), every
mutation causes a change in the genotype. In contrast to
genotype, phenotype comprises only observable characteristics, such as biochemical, morphological, or growth traits.
For instance, the product of argA allows an organism to
make enough arginine to support growth in media devoid
of arginine. Any mutation in argA is a genotypic change,
but if the result is a synonymous amino acid substitution,
then there is no phenotypic change; the organism can still
make its own arginine. However, if the mutation destroys
the activity of the argA product, then the microbe can no
longer make arginine, and the amino acid must be supplied
in the medium. This is a phenotypic change, too. A mutant
that has lost the ability to synthesize a substance required
for growth is called an auxotroph.

X-rays and gamma rays

It is also important to realize that small mutations (such as
a single base substitution) can have large effects on phenotype,
whereas large mutations (such as the insertion of a 5-kb transposon between two genes) may have little or no effect. To
illustrate, consider that a single point mutation in the hpr gene
of the phosphotransferase sugar transport system (discussed in
Section 4.2 and eTopic 4.1) will render a bacterium incapable
of growing on many sugars, but inserting 5 kb of DNA just
past the hpr stop codon will have no effect on cell growth. For
mutations, it’s often not the size that counts; it’s the location.

Mutations Arise by Diverse Mechanisms

DNA is susceptible to damage inflicted by a variety of physical and chemical agents. For example, irradiation by X-rays
can cause a massive number of DNA strand breaks. When
this happens, the integrity of the chromosome is lost and the
cell dies. Other agents can directly modify the bases in DNA
while leaving its overall structure intact. In this case, the modified bases have altered hydrogen bond base-pairing properties
that result in the incorporation of an inappropriate base during replication. When that happens, a mutation results.

amino group shifts to an imino ( NH) group, for example,
then base-pairing changes. A cytosine that normally basepairs with guanine will, in its rare imino form, base-pair with
adenine. Tautomeric shifts that occur during DNA replication
will increase the number of mutational events. Even though
the replication apparatus is very accurate with various proofreading and repair functions, such as the 3′-to-5′ exonuclease
activity of DNA polymerase III (see the discussion of DnaQ
in Section 7.3), mistakes do occur, albeit at a very low rate.
Besides misincorporation mistakes, naturally occurring
intracellular chemical reactions with water can damage DNA.
These endogenous reactions are an important source of spontaneous mutations. For example, cytosine spontaneously
deaminates to yield uracil (Fig. 9.19). The result is a GCto-AT transition. In addition, purines are particularly susceptible to spontaneous loss from DNA via breakage of the
glycosidic bond connecting the base to the sugar backbone
(Fig. 9.20). The result of this loss is the formation of an apurinic site (one missing a purine base) in the DNA. Lack of a
purine would obviously hinder transcription and replication.

DNA can also be damaged by metabolic activities of the
cell that produce reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen
peroxide (H 2O2), superoxide radicals (•O2 –), and hydroxyl
radicals (•OH). Even though bacteria have biochemical
mechanisms to detoxify reactive oxygen species, the systems can be overwhelmed. Oxidative damage causes the
production of thymidine glycol or 8-oxo-7-hydrodeoxyguanosine in DNA (Fig. 9.21).
Naturally occurring intracellular methylation agents (for
example, S-adenosylmethionine) can spontaneously methylate DNA to produce a variety of altered bases. The spontaneous methylation of the N-7 position of guanine, for
example, weakens the glycosidic bond and spontaneously releases the base (forming an apurinic
site) or opens the imidazole ring (formGuanine

of its electrons to the point where the molecule is unstable.
If two pyrimidines are neighbors on a single DNA strand,
their energized electrons can react to form a four-membered
cyclobutane ring. The result is a pyrimidine dimer that will
block replication and transcription (Fig. 9.22).
Although DNA can be damaged in numerous ways,
the cell can repair that damage before it becomes fixed
as a mutation. But the repair mechanisms are not perfect.
Repair errors contribute heavily to the formation of heritable mutations and, thus, to evolution. Although most mutations decrease the fitness of a species, some can improve
fitness by, among other things, enabling an organism to
more efficiently use or compete for available food sources.

Mutation Rates and Frequencies

The mutation rate for a given gene is often defined
as the number of mutations formed per cell division. Since
the number of cells in a typical culture starts out very low
and grows to a very high density, the number of cell divisions is approximately equal to the number of cells in the
culture. For example, to go from one cell to eight cells
requires seven cell divisions (not generations). Mutation
rate can be estimated according to the formula a = m per
number of cell divisions, where a is the mutation rate and
m is the number of mutations that occur as the number

FIGURE 9.23

■ Sectored colonies of bacteria.
This E. coli
mutator strain is a lactose-negative mutant that does not ferment
lactose and thus does not turn the indicator blue. But because the
strain has a mutation in one of the mutator genes, there is a high
rate of reversion to the lactose fermenter strain, which shows up as
blue papillae on the white colony.

of cells increases from N 0 to N. Thus, a culture growing
from 103 (1,000) cells to 107 (10,000,000) cells requires
approximately 107 cell divisions (10,000,000 – 1,000 =
9,999,000 cell divisions). If 10 mutants developed in a
specific gene, then the mutation rate would be approximately 10/107 = 1 × 10 –6. More on mutation rate can be
found in eTopic 9.4.

Note:

Distinguish between the number of cell divisions, the number of generations, and the number of cell generations. For instance,
the replication of 1,000 cells to give 2,000 cells requires 1,000 cell
divisions but takes place over only one generation (meaning one doubling). You will sometimes see the phrase mutation rate “per cell generation,” which is essentially equivalent to “per cell division.”

A less complicated calculation is mutation frequency.
Mutation frequency tells us how many mutant cells are
present in a population. It is calculated simply as the ratio
of mutants per total cells in the population.
The colonies in Figure 9.23 graphically illustrate the
result of a high mutation rate. The example shows an E.
coli mutator strain that has a point mutation in the lactose
operon. It will not ferment lactose. The medium contains
lactose and peptides as carbon sources, and an indicator
that turns blue if the organism can ferment lactose. This
medium helps scientists follow the development of mutations in the gene needed to ferment lactose. Because the
original cell in this case was Lac– (due to a mutation in that
gene), most of the colony is white. However, the strain is
a mutator strain defective in a DNA repair gene (see Section 9.4). This defect causes a high rate of reversion to Lac+.

Each papilla represents a separate mutational event.

9.6 You have been asked to calculate the mutation rate for

a gene in Salmonella enterica, so you dilute an 18-hour broth
culture to 1 × 104 cells/ml and let it grow to 1 × 109 cells/ml. At
that point you dilute and plate cells on the appropriate agar
medium and estimate that there were 10,000,000 mutants in
the culture. What you don’t know is that the original dilution of
1 × 104 cells/ml already had 10 mutants defective in that gene.
Does the presence of those 10 mutants affect your estimate
of the mutation rate? If so, then how?

Identifying Mutagens Using
Bacterial “Guinea Pigs”

In a world where we are continually exposed to new
chemicals, it is important to determine which chemicals
are potential mutagens. Bruce Ames and his colleagues
invented a simple alternative that uses bacteria as a rapid
initial screen, for which Ames received the National Medal
of Science in 1998. The method, called the Ames test,
relies on a mutant of Salmonella enterica that is defective in
the hisG gene, whose product is involved in histidine biosynthesis (Fig. 9.24). The hisG mutant cannot grow on a
minimal defined medium lacking histidine. However, if a
reversion mutation occurs in the hisG gene and restores the
gene to its original functional state (phenotypic reversion),

A hisG auxotrophic mutant of
Salmonella enterica will not
grow on histidine-free medium.

the new mutant cell will form a colony even in the absence
of histidine. This method is called a reversion test.
Ames used this his reversion test to screen compounds
for potential mutagenicity. If a chemical can mutate one
gene (hisG), it can potentially affect any gene. As shown
in Figure 9.24, a mutagen-containing disk is placed in the
middle of an agar plate spread with the original his mutant.
As the mutagen diffuses into the medium and causes reversion mutations, colonies start to appear, forming a ring
around the disk. The longer the plate is incubated, the
more revertants are produced.
The plate reversion test goes only so far, however. The
technique will not expose potential mutagens that require
processing by mammalian enzymes to become mutagenic. In
humans, many nonmutagenic chemicals can be transformed
into potent mutagens by the liver. The liver is the chief organ
for detoxifying the body—a task that liver enzymes accomplish by chemically modifying foreign substances. To expose
the mutagenic potential of a chemical, the chemical is treated
with a rat liver extract before the mixture is applied to bacteria for the his reversion test (Fig. 9.25). If the enzymes of

be seen on any plate.

the liver convert the compound to a mutagen (they do this
accidentally, not on purpose), then His+ revertant colonies
will be seen. This method accelerates the process of drug
discovery by providing an inexpensive preliminary screen
for weeding out mutagenic chemicals before more expensive
animal testing is undertaken.
More involved assays for mutagenicity involve transgenic
mice. Mice are engineered to have the bacterial lacZ gene,
for instance, inserted into their chromosomes. The lacZ
gene encodes an enzyme that is easily assayed, so it is useful as a reporter for mutagenic activity. This reporter gene
will be distributed throughout the mouse in all organs. A
potential mutagen is administered to the mouse, and after
some time the mouse is sacrificed, its organs are removed,
and the DNA is extracted and examined for mutations arising in the lacZ gene. This approach allows scientists to
track where the mutagen is distributed in the mouse and to
determine whether certain organs convert harmless precursor chemicals into dangerous mutagenic compounds.

To Summarize

■

A mutation is any heritable change in DNA sequence,
regardless of whether a change in gene function results.
Genotype reflects the genetic makeup of an organism,
whereas phenotype reflects its physical traits.
Classes of mutations include silent mutations, missense
mutations, nonsense mutations, point mutations, insertions, deletions, and frameshift mutations.
Spontaneous mutations reflect tautomeric shifts in
DNA nucleotides during replication, accidental incorporation of noncomplementary nucleotides during

replication, or “natural” levels of chemical or physical
(irradiation) mutagens in the environment.

Chemical mutagens can alter purine and pyrimidine
structure and change base-pairing properties.
The mutagenicity of a chemical can be assessed by its
effect on bacterial cultures.

DNA Repair

Microorganisms are equipped with a variety of molecular
tools that repair DNA damage before the damage becomes
a heritable mutation (see Table 9.3). The type of repair
mechanism used (and when it is used) depends on two
things: the type of mutation needing repair and the extent
of damage. Some repair mechanisms are error proof and do
not introduce mutations; others are error prone and require
“emergency” DNA polymerases expressed under dire circumstances. These polymerases sacrifice replication accuracy to rescue the damaged genome. Whether damage is
introduced by mutagens or by inaccurate DNA synthesis,
microbial survival depends on the ability to repair DNA.
We will first discuss the error-proof repair pathways
that prevent mutations. These include methyl mismatch
repair, photoreactivation, nucleotide excision repair, base
excision repair, and recombinational repair. Then we will
turn our attention to error-prone repair pathways. These
pathways risk introducing mutations and operate only
when damage is so severe that the cell has no other choice
but to die. Realize that many repair enzymes are in short
supply. Special Topic 9.1 describes a new DNA wire model
for how some important DNA repair enzymes locate DNA
damage.

Error-Proof Repair Pathways

Methyl mismatch repair. What happens if DNA poly-

merase simply makes a mistake and incorporates a normal
but incorrect base? The inherent error rate of DNA polymerase III is approximately one mistake per 108 bases synthesized, after proofreading. However, the mutation rate
in a live cell is actually only 10 –10 per base pair replicated.
But how can a cell repair a mutation after it has already
been introduced during replication? One method is methyl
mismatch repair, which is based on repair enzymes recognizing the methylation pattern in DNA bases. As discussed in Section 7.3, many bacteria tag their parental
DNA by methylating it at specific sites. In E. coli, for example, deoxyadenosine methylase (Dam) methylates the palindromic sequence GATC to produce GA METC. The Dam
methylase does this soon, but not immediately, after replication of a DNA sequence.
Misincorporation of a base during replication produces a
mismatch between the incorrect base in the newly synthesized but unmethylated strand and the correct base residing
in the parental, methylated strand. Methyl-directed mismatch repair enzymes (MutS, MutL, and MutH) bind to
the mismatch. MutS first binds to the mismatch and recruits
MutL and MutH (Fig. 9.26 , steps 1 and 2). MutL recognizes the methylated strand (GA METC) and brings it in a
loop to meet MutS and MutH (steps 3 and 4). Then, MutH
cleaves the unmethylated strand containing the mutation,
near the GATC sequence (step 5). A DNA helicase called
UvrD then unwinds the cleaved strand, exposing it to a variety of exonucleases (step 6). The result is a gap that is filled
in by DNA polymerase I (Pol I) and sealed by DNA ligase.
The methyl-directed mismatch repair proteins (and
genes) are called Mut (and mut) because a high mutation
rate results in strains that are defective in one of these proteins. A bacterial strain with a high mutation rate is called
a mutator strain.

Not all DNA methylations signal methyl mismatch repair.
DNA methylation by restriction-modification systems, for example,
prevents cleavage by DNA restriction endonucleases, but is not
used to designate parental DNA after replication.

repair mechanisms do not distinguish between parental
and newly synthesized strands. Many microbes in the environment commonly encounter ultraviolet light. The pyrimidine dimers that form as a result of ultraviolet irradiation

9.7 During transformation in Streptococcus pneumoniae, a

single strand of donor DNA is transferred into the recipient.
This single strand of DNA can be recombined into the recipient’s genome at the homologous area. However, if the segment
of recipient DNA had a mutation in it relative to the donor DNA
strand, then the result would be a mismatch after recombination. Explain how, in the face of mismatch repair, the recipient
cell ever retains the wild-type sequence from the donor.

The bacterial cell, in
this case E. coli, can use specific methylations on DNA to recognize
parental DNA strands for preferential DNA repair. Newly replicated
strands are not immediately methylated. So, when a mismatch is
found, the mismatch repair system views the newly synthesized
strand as suspect and replaces the section of unmethylated DNA encompassing the mismatch. The steps following cleavage are similar
to what is shown in Figure 9.27 (steps 7 and 8).

GENES AND GENOMES

How do DNA repair proteins find DNA damage? Do they randomly float in the cytoplasm until they happen to bump into
an abasic site or a mispaired base? Or do they bind DNA and
slide along its length until running into something? Jacqueline Barton from the California Institute of Technology (Fig. 1)
thinks that neither option is likely for repair proteins containing [4Fe-4S] groups. The [4Fe-4S] group is a tetrahedral cluster (Fig. 2, inset) with important roles in oxidation-reduction
chemistry involving electron transfer. The position of [4Fe4S] clusters in proteins is coordinated by four cysteine residues that bind to the Fe molecules.
How might a redox center help repair proteins locate DNA
damage? Many DNA repair enzymes are in very short supply.
The DNA glycosylase MutY in E. coli, for instance, is present
at only about 30 proteins per cell. It would take a long time
for those few molecules to scan that much DNA. It would
be nice if different repair proteins could collaborate in some
way to scan large stretches of DNA for defects. Barton and
her collaborators think that is exactly what happens. Their

The stacked core of aromatic bases that extends down
the helical axis of DNA allows DNA to conduct electrons, but
only if the DNA is intact. DNA damage destroys the integrity
of the wire. Repair proteins with [4Fe-4S] clusters that bind
DNA can pass an electron along an undamaged DNA “wire” (a
process called DNA charge transport, or CT) to another protein with a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Here is how the model works

can be repaired by a light-activated mechanism called photoreactivation. In photoreactivation, the enzyme photolyase binds to the dimer and cleaves the cyclobutane
ring linking the two adjacent, damaged nucleotides. The
damage is repaired without any bases being excised.
While photolyase is specific for pyrimidine dimer repair
and requires light, a system called nucleotide excision
repair (NER) operates in the dark (or light) and is used
to excise other kinds of damaged DNA, as well as pyrimidine dimers. In this system, a three-subunit endonuclease (UvrABC) excises a patch of 12–13 nucleotides that
includes the dimer (Fig. 9.27 ). The basic mechanism
involves UvrA, associated with UvrB, recognizing the damaged base (Fig. 9.27, steps 1–3). UvrA is ejected (step 4),
and UvrB binds UvrC (step 5), which actually cleaves the damaged strand at two sites flanking the damaged base (step 6).
The small fragment is removed, and the gap is repaired
by DNA polymerase I (steps 7 and 8). Besides pyrimidine
dimers, NER can repair damage such as O 6 -methylguanine, N 2-guanine, N 3-adenine, and other modified bases
that significantly alter base pairing and helix conformation.
Nucleotide excision repair is also used to excise other kinds
of damaged DNA besides pyrimidine dimers.
Nucleotide excision repair can be enhanced by ongoing
RNA transcription. Bacteria and eukaryotic cells preferentially repair genes that are being transcribed. The preferential repair of transcriptionally active genes makes sense,
since a cell unable to transcribe such a gene because of
recent DNA damage would be at a survival disadvantage.
An RNA polymerase that encounters a UV dimer or other
unrecognizable base on a template DNA strand will stall
during transcription. The stalled RNA polymerase is then
recognized by a protein that mediates a process called transcription-coupled repair (TCR). One TCR pathway dislodges RNA polymerase (Mfd dependent); the other pushes
RNA polymerase back from the lesion (UvrD and NusA
dependent). The transcription-coupled repair protein then
snares a nearby UvrAB to begin nucleotide excision repair.
Base excision repair snips damaged bases from DNA.

Although nucleotide excision repair can recognize and repair
several types of damage, it does not work in all instances.
Another error-proof process, known as base excision repair
(BER), employs a battery of glycosylase enzymes that can
recognize and clip certain damaged bases from the phosphodiester backbone. Uracil DNA glycosylase, hypoxanthine DNA glycosylase, and 3-methyladenine glycosylase
recognize, respectively, uracil, hypoxanthine, and 3-methyladenine when these bases are present in DNA. Uracil
can be found in DNA either as a spontaneous deamination
product of cytosine (see Fig. 9.19) or as a result of inappropriate incorporation during replication. Spontaneous deamination of adenine residues produces hypoxanthine. Uracil

lead to mutations. Mutagens such as methyl methanesulfonate can alkylate adenine to produce the adduct 3-methyladenine. A 3-methyladenine residue will totally block DNA
replication, making this a lethal form of damage. Consequently, repairing these mutations is vital for survival.

The site is called an AP site because it is missing either
a purine (apurinic) or a pyrimidine (apyrimidinic). The
next step in base excision repair involves AP endonucleases

downstream of the AP site and at the same time synthesize
in its stead a replacement strand containing the proper

Thought Question

9.8 It has been reported that hypermutable bacterial strains are overrepresented in clinical isolates.
Out of 500 isolates of Haemophilus influenzae, for
example, 2%–3% were mutator strains having mutation rates 100–1,000 times higher than lab reference
strains. Why might mutator strains be beneficial to
pathogens?

All of the repair processes described thus far (mismatch
repair, photoreactivation, nucleotide excision repair, and
base excision repair) are error-proof pathways that rely on
the presence of a good template strand opposite the damaged strand. Replication of the template strand is used to
replace the damaged bases accurately. But what happens when both strands are damaged or when there
is only one strand?
Recombinational repair. Figure 9.29 illustrates one

I. Recombinational repair is not limited to pyrimidine
dimers. It will work on any damage that causes gaps during replication.

Error-Prone DNA Repair

SOS (“Save Our Ship”) repair. When DNA damage is
extensive, repair strategies that excise pieces of DNA or that
require recombination will destroy the circularity of the
chromosome and kill the cell. To save the chromosome,
and itself, the cell must take more drastic measures and
induce the SOS response, a system that introduces mutations into severely damaged DNA. The cell relaxes replication fidelity to maintain a circular chromosome even
if incorrect bases are introduced. In the SOS system, the
RecA protein, normally located at the cell poles, senses the
extent of DNA damage by monitoring the level of singlestranded DNA produced. For example, excessive ultraviolet
irradiation produces numerous ssDNA gaps because DNA
polymerase cannot replicate through pyrimidine dimers.
RecA interacts with the ssDNA and disengages from the
poles.
Formation of RecA filaments (see Fig. 9.16, step 2) on
ssDNA activates a second function of RecA, called coprotease activity, that stimulates autodigestion of the LexA
repressor, a protein that normally prevents SOS activation. LexA protein binds to the promoters of DNA repair
genes and prevents their transcription (Fig. 9.30A and B).
Cleavage of LexA then unleashes the production of DNA
repair enzymes. Among these enzymes are two “sloppy”
DNA polymerases that lack proofreading activity: DinB
(also called DNA polymerase IV, or Pol IV) and UmuDC
(also called DNA polymerase V, or Pol V) (Fig. 9.30C).
The UmuDC enzyme is perfect for replicating through
damaged bases (a process called translesion bypass replication) because it sacrifices accuracy for continuity. When
the enzyme encounters an undecipherable damaged base,
it will insert whatever nucleotide is available. The result,
of course, will be numerous permanent mutations, but the
benefit is that the cell has a chance to live if it can tolerate
the mutations. The choice really is “mutate or die,” because
housekeeping DNA polymerases like Pol III cannot move
through damaged DNA. (Note that the term “housekeeping” is applied to proteins or enzymes that keep the cell
running at all times.)
When the cell is severely compromised by mutation,
it temporarily stops dividing. Like a pit stop during an
auto race, this pause in cell division allows time for repair
enzymes to fix the damage. The product of another SOSregulated gene, called sulA, causes this pause by binding
to the FtsZ cell division protein, keeping it from initiating cell division (see Sections 3.1 and 3.4). Once the damage has been repaired, RecA coprotease is inactivated
and LexA repressor accumulates, turning off all the SOS
genes, including sulA. The lingering SulA protein is then
degraded by a protease called Lon. The protein is called

of different mechanisms that collaborate to rescue the cell.

Lon because when it is missing, SulA inappropriately accumulates, inhibits cell division, and produces long filamentous cells.
The coprotease activity of RecA can also activate prophages by stimulating autocleavage of proteins that prevent phage replication. This phenomenon is used by some
organisms to displace competitors in an environmental
niche. For instance, Streptococcus pneumoniae, a cause of
pneumonia, displaces Staphylococcus aureus in the human
nasopharynx by producing hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen
peroxide damages S. aureus DNA, which activates the SOS

response and triggers replication of resident bacteriophages
that lyse the cell. The loss of Staphylococcus aureus means
more room for Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Nonhomologous end joining. Double-strand breaks in
DNA are particularly dangerous to a cell because the loss
of chromosome integrity is immediate. In rapidly growing bacteria such as E. coli, double-strand breaks can be
repaired by homologous recombination as long as another
copy of the chromosome is present to guide the repair.

repair system. In humans, the ancestor of mutS evolved to
have multiple repair functions, as well as to participate in
postmeiotic segregation. Defects in this repair mechanism
have been linked to increased risk of certain colon cancers. Numerous other human genetic diseases are caused
by mutations in homologs of bacterial repair genes. For
example, defective excision repair genes in humans cause
xeroderma pigmentosum, a disease that that leads to blindness and skin cancers. A deficiency in transcription-coupled
repair causes Cockayne syndrome in humans, a devastating
neurodegenerative disease.

break and recruits LigD, a protein with polymerase and 3′
exonuclease activities that fill in or remove single-strand
overhangs, and a ligase activity that joins two doublestrand breaks. Because the system does not require homology, it can be error prone, causing the loss or addition of
a few nucleotides at the break site or even the joining of
two previously unlinked DNA molecules. NHEJ has been

DNA repair pathways in microorganisms include errorproof and error-prone mechanisms.
Methyl mismatch repair uses methylation of the parental DNA strand to distinguish it from newly replicated
DNA. The premise is that the parental strand will contain the proper DNA sequence.
Photoreactivation cleaves the cyclobutane rings of
pyrimidine dimers.
Nucleotide excision repair (NER) clips out a patch of
single-stranded DNA containing certain types of damaged bases.
Base excision repair (BER) excises structurally altered
bases without cleaving the phosphodiester backbone.
The resulting AP (apurinic or apyrimidinic) site is targeted by AP nucleases.
Recombinational repair takes place at a replication
fork. A “good” strand of DNA is used to replace a
homologous damaged strand.
Extensive DNA damage leads to induction of the
SOS response, producing increased levels of the errorproof repair systems, as well as error-prone translesion
bypass DNA polymerases that introduce mutations.
Nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) mechanisms

to the target DNA, forming a transpososome complex
(Fig. 9.34
, step 1). The transposase cuts the phosphodiester backbone (step 2), severing one strand at one end
of the insertion sequence and the other strand at the other
end. The 3′ OH ends of the IS element then attack the
unnicked strands in a transesterification reaction that produces hairpin structures (step 3). In this instance, joining
the ends of the double-stranded molecule produces a single
strand with a hairpin.
After the host carrier DNA is ejected from the transpososome, the hairpin ends are renicked and the 3′ OH ends
attack the target DNA molecule in a staggered manner
(Fig. 9.34, step 4). The element has successfully “jumped”
from one molecule to another without replicating. Note
that the target DNA segment replicates as a result of the
insertion process, thereby producing a copy of the target
sequence at each end of the IS element (step 5).
Nonreplicative transposition is carried out by insertion sequence elements and by composite transposons. A
composite transposon typically consists of two insertion
sequences that flank an antibiotic resistance gene, or one
or more catabolic genes (for example, genes for benzene
catabolism). Often the interior inverted repeats of the IS
elements have degenerated, so the transposase acts on primarily the two outermost inverted repeats, causing the
whole transposon to move as one unit. Tn10 is one such
example (Fig. 9.35).
In contrast to composite transposons, replicative transposition is typically observed with complex transposons, such
as the Tn3 family of transposons (Fig. 9.36A). Tn3 not only
possesses transposase and antibiotic resistance genes, but
also includes a gene whose product is called resolvase. The
transposase acts on the inverted-repeat ends of the element,
causing simultaneous replication and insertion of the transposon into target DNA. Replicative transposition produces
a cointegrate between two different DNA molecules, one of
which was the source of the transposon (Fig. 9.36B). As a
result of transposition and replication, the cointegrate molecule will contain two copies of the element flanking the integrated plasmid. Resolvase is a site-specific recombinase that
mediates recombination between the duplicated transposons
at the internal Tn3 res sites. The result of this recombination
is restoration of the two original circular replicons, each one
now containing a copy of the transposon.

absence of tetracycline, only a few cells in a population may

of tetracycline triggers conjugative transfer of the element,
spreading it throughout the population.
The study of transposons may provide insight into the
workings of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
which causes AIDS. The structure of transposase from
transposon Tn5 bears a striking similarity to the HIV integrase needed to embed the reverse-transcribed HIV viral
DNA into the human genome (see Section 11.3). Another
type of mobile element, called an integron, has evolved in
bacteria to capture DNA cassettes that encode antibiotic
resistance genes (see eTopic 9.5).

Thought Question

■

9.9 Diagram how a composite transposon like Tn10 can

generate inversions or deletions in target DNA during transposition. Hint: This happens when transposition within the
chromosome occurs using the inverted repeats closest to
the tetracycline resistance gene (see Fig. 9.35). If you draw it
right, you will see, in the end, that the tetracycline resistance
gene is lost.

All of the transposition events mentioned so far involve
transfer between DNA molecules within the same cell. Some
transposons, called conjugative transposons, are able to
transfer from one cell to another by conjugation. One example is the transposon Tn916 of Enterococcus, which encodes
tetracycline resistance. These conjugative transposons excise
from donor DNA and form a circular intermediate, like a
plasmid, just prior to conjugation, but they do not replicate
autonomously. They must be part of a larger self-replicating
DNA entity (for example, plasmid, chromosome, or phage).
Once transferred into a new host, the conjugative transposon integrates into the recipient’s chromosome. Tn916
and some other conjugative transposons evolved to transfer when a population is facing danger. For example, in the

Transposable elements and insertion sequences
(“jumping genes”) move from one DNA molecule to
another, usually without replicating separately (that is,
they are not plasmids).
Transposase is an enzyme that forms a transpososome
complex with the transposable element and target DNAs.
Insertion sequences are simple DNA transposable elements containing a transposase gene flanked by short
inverted-repeat sequences.
Transposable elements move by nonreplicative or replicative mechanisms.
Transposons are complex transposable elements carrying
additional genes (encoding, for example, drug resistance).
Composite transposons have two duplicate insertion
sequence elements that flank additional genes. Often
the interior inverted repeats of these elements contain
mutations.
Transposons can carry a variety of genes, including
antibiotic resistance genes.

Genome Evolution

Can bacterial genes evolve to become part of eukaryotic
genomes—and vice versa? A sense of evolution, of what went
before, pervades efforts to understand microbial genomes.
Genes can be removed (deletion), added (insertion), rearranged (recombination), or divided to the point where the
genome bears only a slight resemblance to what it once was.
The evolution of a genome is a random process driven by
natural selection. Chapter 17 describes the many features
of microbial evolution, but here in Chapter 9 we discuss the
molecular mechanisms that drive that evolution.

GENES AND GENOMES

The result of evolution can be seen in the genomes of
various strains of the gut microbe Escherichia coli. Much
of this evolution presumably took place in the intestines of
human and other animal hosts, the normal habitat of this
organism. The K-12 strain (MG1655), for example, contains
4,641,652 base pairs (compared with the 3 billion base pairs
of the human genome). Of this genome, 87.8% encodes proteins, 0.8% encodes tRNA and rRNA, and another 0.7% is
DNA with no known function. Approximately 11% of the
chromosome is involved with various forms of regulation.
Even though E. coli is the best-studied organism on the
planet, about 20% of the 4,489 genes still remain a mystery
to us, having no known function other than vague annotations such as “oxidoreductase.” Close examination of the
sequences reveals how the current organism we call E. coli
came about through the evolution of an ancestral genome.
Two basic processes are thought to contribute to genome
restructuring: horizontal gene transfers and duplications followed by functional divergence through mutation.

fl ing comes from comparing the proportion of GC base pairs
along the chromosome (also known as GC content). On
average, the E. coli genome consists of 50.8% GC pairs. But
15% of the K-12 genome and 26% of the O157:H7 genome
show GC proportions that differ significantly from the rest
of the genome and show a different codon usage, suggesting that these genes came from other bacterial species and
were acquired by E. coli more recently. These horizontal
gene transfers, occurring via conjugation, transduction, or
transformation, are estimated to happen at the rate of about
16 kb, or 0.4% of the E. coli genome, every million years.
Noticing a sudden change in the GC content in a chromosome DNA sequence is the equivalent of an evolutionary
“footprint” marking a horizontal gene transfer. The region
where such a change is observed is called a genomic island.

Microbial genomes evolve by randomly assembling an eclectic array of genes from many sources. For example, it has been
estimated that nearly 20% of the E. coli genome may have originated in other microbes. E. coli strain O157:H7, the culprit in
several fatal outbreaks of food-borne disease throughout the
world, contains 1,387 genes that are not in strain K-12. These
additional genes represent about 25% of the O157:H7 genome
and encode virulence factors, metabolic pathways, and prophages (phage genes integrated into host chromosomes), all of
which were acquired from other species. The impact of horizontal gene transfer on genome evolution is estimated to be
100 times greater than the impact of mutations.

containing numerous genes that serve a common function,
such as virulence (pathogenicity islands), symbiosis (symbiosis islands), or survival (fitness islands).
Genomic islands are often flanked by boundary regions
such as direct repeats or insertion elements, usually found
near tRNA genes (Fig. 9.37). The association of genomic
islands with tRNA genes may reflect the fact that some
tRNA genes are dispensable because often multiple copies of
a given tRNA gene are present within a genome. Genomic
islands as a whole are often genetically unstable, subject to
further rearrangements or deletions, and very often contain
functional or remnant mobility genes encoding transposases,
integrases, or other enzymes associated with recombination.
Pathogenicity and symbiosis islands can encode remarkable protein secretion systems (called type III and type
IV secretion systems) capable of injecting effector proteins directly from the bacterium straight into a eukaryotic

useful? Work from Gos Micklem and colleagues at the

appear to include a variety of genes horizontally transferred
from bacteria (Fig. 9.39). How the genes jumped domains
is unclear.

transferred from Bacteria to eukaryotic ticks and mites several times over millions of years. The bacterial version of
the protein, called Tae, degrades peptidoglycan and is delivered as the tip of a spear from one bacterium to another via
type VI secretion (discussed in Special Topic 25.1). Once
injected into the “enemy” bacterium, Tae kills the victim
by disassembling the bacterial cell wall. Among the eukaryotic recipients of the dae gene is the deer tick Ixodes scapularis, which serves as the reservoir for the Lyme disease
spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease is described
in Chapter 26). After their horizontal transfer, the dae
genes became expressed and eventually acquired eukaryotic
protein secretion signals. Figure 9.40 illustrates that the
I. scapularis dae gene helps the insect control the levels of
B. burgdorferi colonizing the tick’s midgut. The bacterial
gene, therefore, became part of the Ixodes innate immune
system against B. burgdorferi and probably other bacteria.
Innate immunity is described in Chapter 23. Evidence of
more massive DNA transfers from some endosymbiotic
bacteria to their eukaryotic hosts is discussed in eTopic 9.6.
Can interdomain DNA transfers take place in the opposite direction—from humans to bacteria, for instance?
Mark Anderson and Han Seifert from Northwestern University found that up to 11% of Neisseria gonorrhoeae isolates (the cause of gonorrhea) contain human-derived DNA
sequences known as L1, or long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs). LINEs are human DNA sequences that
copy and insert themselves from one gene into another.
Since the L1 sequence in N. gonorrhoeae was not found in
the closely related species N. meningitidis, the transfer from
L1 to N. gonorrhoeae probably occurred relatively recently
in evolutionary history (after N. gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis split from their common ancestor). The function of
Neisseria L1 is currently unknown.

The Intestine: Cauldron of HGT

The human gastrointestinal tract is ideal for exchanging genetic information between widely diverse species

(Section 23.1). The gut contains a high bacterial cell density and mixed-species biofilms that enable close and frequent contact between organisms, both living (a requisite
for conjugation) and dead (a source of transforming DNA).
The intestine is also rife with phages that can mediate transduction. Section 8.6 described a spectacular example of
horizontal transfer that likely took place within the human
gut. A gene enabling digestion of a complex carbohydrate
found only in red seaweed was transferred from a marine
bacterium to an ancestor of the human intestinal bacterium
Bacteroides plebeius. Human digestion, helped by this new
bacterium, could now harvest carbon and energy from this
unique carbohydrate.
Perhaps the most intriguing and worrisome evidence of
horizontal gene transfer (HGT) in the gut involves antibiotic resistance. The gut microbiome can be considered
a repository of many antibiotic resistance genes, usually
within anaerobic members of the microbiome. Studies that
examined the gut metagenomes of hundreds of individuals have identified upwards of 1,000 antibiotic resistance
genes “lurking” among the microbial population. Their
presence is not always evident until someone is treated with
an antibiotic. For example, a plasmid encoding high-level
resistance to carbapenem antibiotics was horizontally transferred from Klebsiella pneumoniae to Escherichia coli in the
intestine of a 91-year-old patient. The resistance enzyme,
carbapenemase, confers resistance to all cephalosporins,
monobactams, and carbapenems used as first-line drugs
for hospitalized patients (Chapter 27). The man was being
treated for sepsis (a severe blood infection) with ertapenem. When the man’s stool was tested after treatment, it
contained carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae, but not
E. coli. One month later, carbapenem-resistant E. coli containing the same plasmid was recovered from his stool.
Antibiotic exposure may even induce HGT among
microbiome members. Human volunteers whose stools
contained erythromycin-susceptible Bacteroides strains were
given erythromycin. Within 7 days, erythromycin-resistant
Bacteroides strains were found. Conjugation of erythromycin resistance plasmids from unknown members of the gut

FIGURE 9.41 ■ Model for horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between gut microbiota. High cell density and biofilm formation in the
intestine makes the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance (or other genes) easier. Many anaerobic members of the human microbiome
(such as Bacteroides) serve as reservoirs for antibiotic resistance genes. Various gene transfer mechanisms will randomly transfer the genes,
often on plasmids, to other members of the microbiota, some of which are opportunistic pathogens (E. coli, for instance). Opportunistic
pathogens can escape the gut to cause disease in other body locations. Source: Derived from Shaick, 2015. The gut resistome. Philosophical Transactions of

microbiome were implicated. Antibiotics can also induce
the SOS response in bacteria. The SOS response will activate prophage replication (Section 9.4), and the resulting
phage can mediate transduction of genes encoding antibiotic resistance, or other functions, to gut coinhabitants.
Figure 9.41 illustrates the mechanisms by which antibiotic
resistance genes can be transferred between reservoir gut
microbes to opportunistic pathogens that can escape the
intestine, either by defecation or intestinal lesion, to infect
elsewhere.

Genome Reduction

It is important to note that evolution involves gene loss
as well as gene acquisition. The large-scale loss of genes
through evolution is known as genome reduction. For
example, pathogenic shigellae (the cause of bacillary dysentery) exhibit chromosomal “black holes,” regions lacking
genes that occur in the closely related E. coli. Absence of
these genes is required for a fully virulent phenotype (why
is not clear). Genome reduction is discussed in Chapter 17.

Sometimes evidence of genome reduction in the making can be observed. Many genomes contain pseudogenes,
genes that by homology appear to encode an enzyme but
are nonfunctional because a portion is missing through
deletion. These appear to be the remnants of genes that
were useful to an ancestral species but were made superfluous when one of its descendants adapted to a new environmental niche. When evolutionary pressure to retain a
functional form of the gene no longer exists, the imperative
to repair mutations within that gene also evaporates. The
pseudogene, therefore, is in the process of being eliminated.
One pathogen caught in the act of losing its genes because
of its lifestyle is Mycobacterium leprae, the cause of Hansen’s
disease (leprosy). Over half of the M. leprae genome is made
of pseudogenes, presumably formed from genes it no longer
needs after becoming an obligate intracellular pathogen.

Gene duplication is the most important mechanism for generating new genes and biochemical processes. Duplication

Controlling uninvited genes. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli
(EHEC) expresses many virulence genes from horizontally
transferred pathogenicity islands (PAIs). Certain PAI proteins
injected into intestinal cells compel pedestals to form that
cup the bacteria (panel A). Vanessa Sperandio and Charley
Gruber discovered that this PAI process is controlled by a
non-PAI regulatory system (GlmZ) that normally controls cell
wall synthesis. Low GlmZ levels (panel B) increase pedestal
formation compared to wild type (panel A), whereas high
levels of GlmZ (panel C) decrease pedestal formation. Thus,
the core chromosome-encoded Glm system was co-opted to

regulatory mechanisms used to effect that change.

10.1 Gene Expression: Levels of Control

Why do PAI genes co-opt nonPAI regulators to control their
expression?

The most likely reason horizontally acquired islands appropriate
recipient regulatory systems is
that those systems already sense
the cell’s environment. The Glm system, for example, controls synthesis of amino sugars used for cell wall biosynthesis. It was “smart” for EHEC PAI genes involved in type III
secretion (T3SS) to co-opt Glm control because assembly
of this secretion system requires cell wall rearrangement.

Yes. QseEF is a two-component signal transduction system
that binds epinephrine to sense entry into a host. QseEF initiates pedestal formation by activating several PAI genes.
Boris Gorke’s group found that QseF also regulates synthesis
of the sRNA glmY that stabilizes GlmZ. So, during infection,
QseE senses epinephrine and phosphorylates QseF. QseF-P
activates the transcription of glmY, which then stabilizes
GlmZ. Finally, elevated GlmZ limits pedestal formation.

GENES AND GENOMES

The Current Research Highlight illustrates how a horizontally acquired gene becomes integrated into the regulatory network of a bacterial cell. Integration ensures that the
new gene is expressed only when it is beneficial to the cell.
But what constitutes a regulatory network? Microbes use
numerous mechanisms to sense their internal and external
environments. The information collected directs synthesis of waves of proteins whose concentrations change with
changing environments. The cell’s surface, for example,
contains an array of sensing proteins that monitor osmolarity, pH, temperature, and the chemical content of the
surroundings. Quorum sensing, in which bacteria secrete
and sense chemical signaling molecules, allows members
of microbial communities to communicate, cooperate, and
even promote symbiotic relationships.
Take the Hawaiian bobtailed squid, Euprymna scolopes.
During the day, this tiny squid remains buried in the sand
of shallow reef flats around Hawaii. After sunset, the animal emerges from its hiding place and begins its search
for food. As it swims in the moonlit night, its light organ
projects light downward in an apparent attempt to camouflage the squid from predatory fish swimming below.
Looking up, the fish see only light (called counterillumination), not a squid’s shadow moving against the surfacefiltered light of the moon. The light, however, is not made
by the squid. Inside the squid’s light organ are luminescent bacteria called Aliivibrio fischeri (formerly Vibrio
fischeri). Bacteria, not the squid, produce the light. However, these microbes do not constantly glow. They light
up only when their cell number and the concentration of
a secreted signaling molecule rise above a threshold level.
The critical density of bacteria is attained by nightfall, and
the genes needed to make light are “turned on.” Symbiosis is achieved because the bacteria obtain nutrients growing in the light organ, and the squid, for its part, survives
another night.
Chapter 10 explores the fundamental principles of gene
regulation in microbes and discusses how these individual
systems are woven into global regulatory networks that
interconnect many processes throughout the cell.

In general, DNA sequence–level control is the most drastic and the least reversible, whereas control at the protein
(translational/posttranslational) level is the most rapid and
most reversible. We summarize these control levels here
and then discuss examples.

10.1

Gene Expression:
Levels of Control

How many ways can a gene’s expression be controlled? The
expression of genes and their products (mRNA and protein) can be controlled at various levels, with each level of
control offering different advantages to the cell. The major
levels of control can be categorized as DNA sequence controls, mRNA stability controls, transcriptional controls,
translational controls, and posttranslational modifications.

■

Alteration of DNA sequence. Some microbes use random or programmed changes of DNA sequence to activate or disable a particular gene. One example is phase
variation, in which reversible fl ipping of a DNA segment
enables a pathogen to turn on or turn off expression of
cell-surface proteins. The switch in protein structure
helps the microbe evade a host’s immune system.

■

Control of transcription. Many types of gene regulation occur at the level of transcription. The most
common mechanisms of transcriptional control in prokaryotes involve operons. Recall that an operon is a
string of two or more genes in a chromosome that are
expressed from a common promoter located in front of
the first gene in the operon. Genes in an operon are
coordinately regulated by protein repressors, activators,
and sigma factors, as well as by small RNAs (sRNAs).
Coordinate regulation means that the expression levels of all genes in the operon increase or decrease
simultaneously.

■

Control of mRNA stability. Levels of specific mRNA
molecules are regulated by RNase activity, which
degrades some mRNA molecules as fast as they are
transcribed. In some cases, sRNA molecules bind RNA
transcripts and help or hinder degradation.

■

Translational control. Translation by ribosomes can
be regulated by sequestering mRNA ribosome-binding
sites or by concealing mRNA sequences that recognize
specific translational repressor proteins. Translational
control mechanisms are often coupled to transcriptional
mechanisms, offering “fine-tuning” of operon control.
Attenuation, for instance, is a mechanism that uses
translation to sense the level of an amino acid in the cell
and then increase or decrease transcription of the genes
encoding the enzymes that synthesize the amino acid.

■

Posttranslational control. Once proteins are made,
their activity can be controlled by modifying protein
structure—for example, by protein cleavage, phosphorylation, methylation, or acetylation. These modifications
can activate, deactivate, or even lead to the destruction
of the protein.

All of these control measures can be used in various
combinations by the cell to build integrated control circuits
that coordinately regulate multiple systems throughout the
cell—a key to homeostasis and balanced growth (see nitrogen regulation, discussed in Section 15.5).

CHAPTER 10

We begin our discussion of gene expression by describing how DNA rearrangements can flip genes on and off.
Next we discuss how bacterial cells monitor conditions
inside and outside of the cell to make “informed” decisions
about altering gene expression. In Section 10.2 we will
then explore several paradigms of operon control.

DNA Rearrangements That
Alter Gene Expression

Most regulatory mechanisms that alter gene expression
use interactions between proteins and DNA, proteins and
RNA, or RNA and RNA. These control mechanisms are
easily reversible. A more drastic means of control, however, involves altering the DNA sequence itself. A classic
example of this strategy is phase variation. Phase variation
helps microbial pathogens avoid the immune system.
Any infection will trigger the production of antibodies specific to the invading microbe’s component parts,
such as pili, flagella, and lipopolysaccharides (discussed in
Chapter 24). Antibodies that bind to these microbial surface structures are useful for clearing an infection. However, some microbes use gene regulation to periodically
change their immunological appearance, like a chameleon
changing its color, by changing the amino acid composition of a particular surface protein. This “shape-shifting”
by the microbe, called phase variation, renders useless
those antibodies specific for the old structure. The embattled immune system must start all over again making new
antibodies, thus prolonging the course of infection. Two
types of DNA rearrangement can be used to generate phase
variations: gene inversions and slipped-strand mispairing.
Gene inversion: an on/off switch. Flagellar phase varia-

tion in the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella enterica
involves a DNA recombination event known as gene inversion that fl ips the orientation of a gene or DNA segment
in the chromosome. S. enterica has two genes, widely separated on the chromosome, that encode different forms
of flagellin, the protein from which flagella are made. A
reversible DNA inversion turns off one gene while turning
on the other. The invertible switch is a 993-bp DNA fragment (or cassette), called the H region, that contains an
outwardly directed promoter and a gene called hin, whose
product, Hin recombinase (also called Hin invertase),
mediates the recombination (Fig. 10.1). In antigenic parlance, the term “H antigen” refers to flagella, so the acronym “Hin” stands for H inversion. The hin DNA cassette
is flanked by short (26-bp) inverted repeats called hixL
(left) and hixR (right).

■

MOLECULAR REGULATION

■

Note:

An inverted repeat is a sequence found in identical (but
inverted) forms at two sites on the same double helix (for example,
5′-ATCGATCGnnnnnnCGATCGAT-3′). A direct repeat is a sequence
found in identical form at two sites on the same double helix (for
example, 5′-ATCGATCGnnnnnnATCGATCG-3′). A tandem repeat is
a direct repeat without any intervening DNA sequence (for example, ATCGATCGATCGATCGATCGATCG).

Hin recombinase collaborates with other less specific
DNA remodeling proteins, such as Fis, to link the 26-bp
left (hixL) and right (hixR) ends of the invertible DNA element. The two ends, each bound to a Hin monomer, are
brought together by Hin-Hin protein interactions. DNA
within the cassette then forms a loop. Hin cuts within
the center of each hix site, producing staggered ends. An
exchange of Hin subunits leads to strand inversion, so that
the orientation of the DNA cassette is reversed relative to
the flanking DNA on either side.
In one orientation, the outwardly directed promoter of
the H region directs expression of H2 flagellin (encoded by
fljB) and a repressor (FljA) that prevents transcription of the
other flagellin gene, fliC (see Fig. 10.1A). After the inversion, however, the promoter points in the wrong direction,
so there is no production of H2 flagellin or FljA, the repressor of fliC (see Fig. 10.1D). Lacking this repressor, the fliC
flagellin gene is expressed. Thus, H1 flagellin (present in
phase 1 cells) is synthesized instead of H2 flagellin (present in phase 2 cells). The amino acid sequences, and thus
the antigenicity, of the two flagellar proteins are different.
Inversion of the H region allows Salmonella to change how
it appears to a host immune system. In each generation, the
rate of the reversible switch varies from about one cell in
103 to one in 105. Note, however, that this switch would
not accomplish much if the infecting population of bacteria
started out mixed—that is, producing both types of flagella.
The initial infection must be of one phenotype.
Slipped-strand mispairing. A different type of phase varia-

tion relies on multiple, short sequence repeats within a gene.
The repeats “confuse” DNA polymerase as it replicates, causing it to slip occasionally during replication. Slippage either
adds a repeat to, or deletes a repeat from, the gene and alters
its translational reading frame. If the mRNA produced during transcription is out of frame, the protein is not made.
This random process can alternately turn a gene off and then
back on again in subsequent generations. A detailed example
is discussed in eTopic 10.1 using the opa genes of Neisseria
gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea. Eukaryotic
microbes, especially pathogenic sporozoa, possess elaborate mechanisms of phase variation. The trypanosome that
causes “sleeping sickness” undergoes extensive genetic shuffl ing and mutation of its coat proteins over successive generations, essentially overwhelming the host immune system by
presenting every possible form of antigen.

expression of two unlinked flagellar protein genes. In one orientation (A), the fljB promoter drives synthesis of H2 flagellin (fljB) and a repressor (FljA) of the H1 flagellin gene (fliC). Action by Hin recombinase causes the segment to invert (B, C), thereby reorienting the promoter.
Because the repressor FljA is not formed, the gene for H1 can be expressed (D).

Thought Question

10.1 While viewing Figure 10.1, imagine the phenotype of a

cell in which fljB has been deleted but fljA is still expressed.
Would cells be motile? What type of flagella would be produced? Would the cells undergo phase variation? What would
happen if fliC alone was deleted?

General Concepts of
Transcriptional Control

DNA rearrangements that alter gene expression are random,
controlled only by the efficiency of the recombinase catalyzing an inversion or the fidelity by which a DNA polymerase

replicates sequence repeats. However, transcriptional and
translational controls are not random. For those mechanisms, a cell must monitor two compartments—the cytoplasm within the cell and the environment outside—to know
when to alter gene expression and adjust its physiology.
Intracellularly, the concentrations of vitamins, amino
acids, and nucleotides must be sufficient and balanced to
supply the biosynthetic and energetic needs of the cell. To
achieve balance, the cell must control de novo (new) synthesis of these compounds and sense the carbon and energy
sources that are present in order to assemble the proper catabolic pathway.
The microbe also needs to detect hazardous conditions
outside the cell and to distinguish whether it is floating

in a pond of water, a gastrointestinal tract, or a mammalian host cell. Once the environment is sensed, the cell can
change the repertoire of genes it expresses to meet its needs
or to protect itself.
Cells use different mechanisms to sense and respond to
conditions within the cell and outside the cell membrane.
Sensing conditions within the cell is relatively straightforward. Regulatory proteins bind specific low-molecularw
weight compounds called ligands (Fig. 10.2A). Different
w

e
proteins bind different ligands. For example,
one
o
n regulator binds a carbohydrate ligand and alerts the
cell that a new carbon source is available, while a different regulator senses whether enough of the amino acid
tryptophan is present in the cytoplasm to carry out protein synthesis. The ligand, once bound, then alters the
ability of the regulatory protein to latch onto specific
DNA regulatory sequences located near the promoters of target genes. The regulatory gene may be located
near to or quite far away from the target gene on the
chromosome.
Genes encoding regulatory proteins are usually, but
not always, transcribed separately from the target gene
(Fig. 10.2A). Regulatory proteins come in two forms:
repressors and activators (note that activator proteins differ from activator sequences of DNA). Repressor proteins
bind to regulator sequences and prevent the transcription
of target genes—an event known as repression. Repression happens in one of two ways (scenarios 1 and 2 in
Fig. 10.2B), depending on the repressor. In scenario 1, the
repressor binds a specific DNA sequence and prevents transcription of a target gene. Relief from repression requires
that a specific ligand, called an inducer, bind to the repressor protein, causing it to release from the DNA sequence.
Because a small inducer molecule is required, the increased
expression of the target gene is called induction. The lactose operon, discussed in Section 10.2, is one example of
an inducible system.

Note:

DNA regulatory sequences are sometimes called “operator sequences” if binding decreases expression of the target genes,
or “activator sequences” if binding increases expression.

362

PART 2

GENES AND GENOMES

Other repressor proteins (scenario 2) bind poorly to
DNA regulatory sequences unless they first bind a small
ligand called a corepressor. As the ligand disappears from
the cell, it is no longer available to bind to the repressor
protein. When this happens, the repressor releases from
the DNA and the target gene is expressed. This process is
called derepression rather than induction. The tryptophan
operon, also discussed later, is an example of a repression/
derepression system.
Activator proteins also bind DNA, but they stimulate
transcription by touching an RNA polymerase stuck
at a nearby promoter, spurring it to initiate transcription (Fig. 10.2C). Most activator proteins bind poorly
to DNA sequences, unless an inducer is present. When
the intracellular concentration of inducer falls, the activator protein (without inducer) either leaves the DNA or
moves to a nearby site from which it can no longer contact
RNA polymerase. As a result, transcription of that target
gene stops.

CI from lambda phage, binds to DNA. The protein

forms a dimer, and one part of each molecule, called the
DNA-binding domain, interacts with DNA in the major
groove. DNA sites that bind regulatory proteins typically
exhibit a sequence symmetry that involves an inverted
repeat (Fig. 10.4). Dimers of a regulatory protein bind
to the DNA, with each member of the duo binding half
of the symmetrical DNA sequence. Protein-DNA binding can be demonstrated in several ways, as described in
Section 12.3.
It is important to realize that all DNA-binding proteins can actually bind at a low level to any DNA sequence.
However, each individual binding protein will bind more
tightly to a specific sequence near a particular promoter.
Thus, DNA-binding proteins exhibit a relative specificity
for DNA target sequences, not absolute specificity. These
proteins essentially “scan” DNA for high-affinity binding sites. Relative specificity helps explain how a promoter,
through evolution, “recruits” the service of a regulatory

Operon Control

In 1961, French scientists Jacques Monod (1910–1976)
and François Jacob (1920–2013) (Fig. 10.6A) proposed
the revolutionary idea that the expression of genes could
be regulated. They, among others, noticed that the enzyme
used by Escherichia coli to consume the carbohydrate lactose was produced only when lactose was added to growth
media. The term “induction” was coined to describe this
phenomenon. The enzymes required to metabolize glucose, however, behaved differently. They were always

present (that is, constitutive) in the cell. The groundbreaking work of Jacob and Monod, and of André Lwoff (1902–
1994) (Fig. 10.6B) for his study of phage lysogeny, won
them a Nobel Prize and launched the field of gene regulation, a scientific realm where discoveries continue to
surprise us.

Lactose catabolism. Lactose is a disaccharide sugar made
of glucose and galactose that can be used as a carbon and
energy source (Fig. 10.7). The E. coli integral membrane
protein that imports (transports) lactose from the extracellular environment is called LacY. The enzyme that subsequently cleaves lactose into its component parts is called

beta-galactosidase (LacZ). The products, glucose and
galactose, are subsequently degraded by the enzymes of
glycolysis to harness energy and capture carbon (see Section 13.5). Without LacY and LacZ, the catabolic energy of
lactose is unavailable to the cell.
Lactose induces the lac operon. Figure 10.8A

the genes in E. coli that encode the simple regulatory circuit for lactose catabolism. The genes lacZ, lacY, and
lacA form an operon, which is a group of genes cotranscribed from a common promoter. The role of lacA, which

In the absence of lactose, the lac operon is transcribed
at extremely low levels (fewer than ten molecules of LacZ
per cell). The reason for low expression is that transcription of lacZYA is repressed by the protein product of the
regulator gene lacI (Fig. 10.8B). The lacI gene is situated
immediately upstream of lacZYA and is transcribed from
a different promoter. A tetramer of LacI repressor protein
forms in the cell and binds to two operator regions

simultaneously binds the lacO and lacOI operators (a
dimer at each site). As a result, the intervening DNA loops
out (Figs. 10.8B and 10.9A) and prevents RNA polymerase from continuing transcription into the structural
lacZYA genes. (A third binding site for LacI exists but is
not important to our discussion here.)
Once lactose is added to the medium, the lac operon is
expressed at 100-fold higher levels. How does lactose get
into the cell to induce the operon if the operon encoding its transport protein is repressed? As noted already,
even when repressed, the lacZYA operon is transcribed
at a low level. (Most genes are expressed at low constitutive levels even when uninduced.) This means that a
small amount of lactose can be transported into the cell
because a few molecules of the lactose transporter LacY
are made. The tiny amount of beta-galactosidase (LacZ)
expressed in uninduced cells is also important. At this low
level, the enzyme does not completely cleave the glycosidic bond of lactose, but rearranges it to form allolactose, the form of lactose that activates the operon (whose
structure is shown in Fig. 10.7). Allolactose binds the

repressor and “unlocks” the protein (by altering the conformation of LacI) so that it is released from the operator (Fig. 10.8C). Once this happens, RNA polymerase
guided by sigma factor (not shown in Fig. 10.8C) can
find the lac promoter sequences and initiate transcription
of the lacZYA structural genes.
cAMP and cAMP receptor protein stimulate transcription. Another important mechanism that governs the level

of lacZYA transcription in E. coli involves a small molecule
called cyclic AMP (cAMP), which accumulates when a cell
is starved for carbon. Cyclic AMP is a derivative of AMP
(adenosine monophosphate) in which the 5′ phosphate is
linked to the 3′ OH group of the ribose, making a cyclic
structure. How cellular levels of cAMP change in response
to carbon starvation has been extensively studied, but questions still remain. What is clear is that intracellular cAMP
levels fluctuate with the activities of enzymes that can make
(adenylyl cyclase), degrade (phosphodiesterases), or export
cAMP. Various internal and external signals alter the balance of these processes (see eTopic 10.2).

Polycistronic message

Activation of the lacZYA operon by cAMP

and CRP. Although the inducer allolactose removes the repres-

sor LacI and allows expression of lacZYA, maximum expression
requires the presence of cAMP and cAMP receptor protein (CRP),
which bind to a separate site at the lacZYA promoter. Bound CRP
can interact with RNA polymerase and increase the rate of transcription initiation.

As it accumulates, cyclic AMP controls the expression
of many genes by combining with a dimeric regulatory
protein called cAMP receptor protein (CRP). The cAMPCRP complex binds to specific DNA sequences located
near many bacterial genes and modifies their transcription, usually acting as an activator. This is the case for the
lacZYA operon (Figs. 10.10 and 10.8D).

Note:

The original name for CRP was “catabolite activator protein” (CAP), given to reflect its role in catabolite repression. Though
some investigators still use the “CAP” designation, the term “CRP”
is generally preferred today. Thus, the gene encoding the protein
is called crp.

How does the cAMP-CRP complex ultimately activate
the expression of lacZYA? RNA polymerase cannot easily
form an open complex (see Section 8.2) and is essentially
stuck at lacP, even in the absence of a LacI repressor. This
problem is overcome when the cAMP-CRP complex binds
to a 22-bp DNA sequence located –60 bp from the start
of transcription (just upstream of the lacZYA operator),
causing the DNA to bend (see Figs. 10.8D and 10.9C).
CRP can then directly interact with the alpha subunit of
RNA polymerase bound at the lac promoter and activate
transcription (Fig. 10.11 and eTopic 10.3). Notice in Figure 10.9B that when neither glucose nor lactose is present,
cAMP-CRP cannot by itself activate lacZYA transcription,
because it binds within the DNA loop formed by the LacI
(repressor) tetramer, leaving no room for RNA polymerase
to bind to DNA.

Note:

Recall that a gene name written in roman (not italic) type
and with a capital first letter is really the name of the protein product of that gene. Thus, lacZ is the gene, but LacZ is the protein.
In presenting a genotype, gene names written with a superscript
+ are considered wild-type genes. Gene names written without a
superscript + are considered mutant genes.

Thought Questions

10.3 Predict the effects of the following null mutations on

the induction of beta-galactosidase by lactose, and predict
whether the lacZ gene is expressed at high or low levels in
each case: The inactivated, mutant genes to consider are lacI,
lacO, lacP, crp, and cya (the gene encoding adenylyl cyclase).
What effects will those mutations have on catabolite repression?

10.4 Predict what will happen to the expression of lacZ
when a second copy of the lac operon region containing
various mutations is present on a plasmid. The genotypes of
these partial diploid strains are presented as chromosomal
genes/plasmid gene. (a) lacI– lacO+P+Z!+Y!+A+/plasmid lacI+;
(b) lacO– lacI+P+Z!+Y!+A+/plasmid lacO+; (c) crp– lacI+O+P+Z!+
Y!+A+/plasmid crp+.

Glucose represses the lac operon. What happens if, in

addition to lactose, the medium contains an alternative carbon source, such as glucose? Enzymes for glucose catabolism (glycolysis) are always produced at high levels because
glucose is the favored catabolite (carbon source), providing the quickest source of energy. Many carbohydrates,
including lactose, must fi rst be converted to glucose to be
catabolized. So, in the interest of greater efficiency, E. coli
forestalls inducing the lac operon while glucose is present.

culture that had glucose.

The PTS transfers a phosphate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) along a series of proteins to glucose during transport. When
glucose is present, the glucose transport proteins continually transfer phosphate to glucose
and, so, are usually left without phosphate
(Fig. 10.13A). Unphosphorylated enzyme
IIA interacts with LacY in the membrane
and inhibits LacY activity. So, lactose cannot enter the cell, and the lac operon remains
uninduced. When glucose is not present, the
PTS proteins remain phosphorylated; enzyme
IIA-P does not interact with LacY, so LacY
transports lactose into the cell; and the lac
operon is induced (Fig. 10.13B).

The phenomenon is known as catabolite repression, in
which the presence of a more favorable catabolite (commonly glucose) prevents expression of operons enabling
catabolism of a second carbohydrate.
When glucose and lactose are both present in the
medium, cells initially grow by breaking down glucose
until the glucose is depleted. Growth temporarily stops
while lactose present in the medium induces the lacZYA
operon. Once induced, cells can consume lactose and
resume growth. The resultant biphasic growth curve is
often called diauxic growth (Fig. 10.12A). But if lactose
was present from the start, why was lacZYA turned off?
It was turned off because glucose indirectly prevents the
induction of lacZYA. Figure 10.12B illustrates that even
when lacZYA is already induced, adding glucose stops (or
represses) induction.
Catabolite repression via inducer exclusion. Failure
of lactose to induce lacZYA during growth on glucose
(Fig. 10.12B, red horizontal line) is due mainly to the fact
that growth on glucose keeps lactose out of the cell. This
phenomenon is known as inducer exclusion. If lactose cannot enter the cell, the lacZYA operon cannot be induced.
The key to inducer exclusion is that a component of the
glucose transport system (phosphotransferase system, or
PTS; see eTopic 4.1), while transporting glucose, will bind
to and inhibit LacY permease (Fig. 10.13).

Thought Question

10.5 Researchers often use isopropyl-β-D-

thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) rather than lactose to induce
the lacZYA operon. IPTG resembles lactose, which is why it
can interact with the LacI repressor, but it is not degraded
by beta- galactosidase. Why do you think the use of IPTG is
preferred in these studies?

Other Systems of Operon Control

Besides the lac operon model, bacteria have a surprising number of different ways to regulate operons. In
this section we discuss proteins that have dual regulatory
functions—performing as both activators (positive control) and repressors (negative control)—and we’ll see how
an idling ribosome sends a chemical signal that affects the
expression of many genes and operons.

The AraC/XylS Family of
Transcriptional Regulators

What could be better than having a regulatory protein that
either represses (like LacI) or activates (like CRP) expression of an operon? How about a regulator that can repress
and activate gene expression, depending on whether a
carbohydrate substrate is available? A regulator this versatile will provide very tight control over operon expression. One such regulator, called AraC, regulates the genes
encoding arabinose catabolism. When arabinose is absent,
AraC represses expression of the genes that break down
arabinose; but when arabinose is present, AraC activates
these same genes. The products of these genes ultimately
convert the five-carbon sugar L-arabinose to D-xylulose
5-phosphate, an intermediate in the pentose phosphate

shunt, a pathway that provides reducing energy for biosynthesis (see Section 13.5).
Bioinformatic computer analysis of microbial genomes
reveals a family of over 10,000 regulators with homology to AraC and the closely related XylS activator (xylose
catabolism). For instance, YbtA is an AraC-type regulator of the Yersinia pestis pesticin/yersiniabactin receptor
for iron uptake. The signature sequence of these proteins
is found at the C-terminal end and contains DNA-binding
motifs. The AraC/XylS family members are a diverse group
of intracellular sensors that collectively regulate a variety of
different cell functions, including carbon metabolism and
virulence, as well as many responses to environmental conditions (Table 10.1).
The AraC/XylS advantage. One advantage of AraC/XylS

family regulators, based on the AraC prototype, is that
they remain affi xed to their target genes. A drawback of the
LacI repressor strategy is that the repressors in this family
must fully dissociate from operator DNA during induction
and disperse throughout the cell. Reestablishing repression requires slow, random diffusion of bulky LacI proteins
back to the lacO DNA sequence. This takes some time. The
AraC/XylS family strategy keeps the regulatory protein
bound near target operons. The regulators simply shuttle back and forth between repressor and activator DNAbinding sites, shortening the delay between induction and
repression. The known small chemical inducer molecules
for these regulators quickly diffuse through the cytoplasm
to fi nd their cognate regulatory proteins already camped at
target promoters.
The AraC strategy. The model for regulation by AraC/

XylS regulators is based primarily on AraC itself, the most
intensely studied family member. AraC is a 33-kDa protein
with a DNA-binding C-terminal domain attached by a flexible linker peptide to the N-terminal dimerization domain
(Fig. 10.14A). AraC forms a dimer in vivo that can assume
one of two conformations, depending on whether arabinose is available. When arabinose is absent, the dimer exists

in a rigid, elongated form because the N-terminal arm
of each monomer binds to its own C-terminal domain.
This form represses expression of the araBAD operon for
arabinose degradation. When arabinose is present, however, the dimer assumes a more compact form because the
N-terminal arm of one monomer binds to the N-terminal
domain of the other monomer. This compact form activates expression of araBAD (Fig. 10.14B).
How does AraC act as both repressor and activator?
AraC is able to bind to three important DNA-binding sites.
Two of them, O2 and I1, are widely separated and flank
a binding site for cAMP-CRP that, as discussed in Section 10.2, is a global activator of many bacterial genes,
including araBAD. The elongated AraC dimer (no arabinose) can bind these two sites. The result is a looped
DNA structure that blocks the CRP-binding site and limits activation by cAMP-CRP. The araBAD operon is not
expressed. However, the I1 site sits next to another site,
I2 , near the promoter. The compact AraC dimer (with

arabinose) can bind only to these sites. Binding to I1I2 prevents DNA loop formation, allows cAMP-CRP access to
the CRP DNA-binding site, and brings AraC close enough
to physically contact an RNA polymerase already bound
(but stuck) at the araBAD promoter. Transcription of the
araBAD operon begins.
According to this model, the DNA region is rarely free
of AraC. Arabinose moves the dimer from one site (repression) to the other (induction). AraC-like proteins show
strong family resemblance at their DNA-binding domains,
but homology usually disappears at the other end of the
protein, the dimerization domain. The dimerization
domain is where these proteins appear to bind or respond
to a particular ligand (for example, arabinose). For most of
the AraC/XylS family members, the identity of the ligand
remains a mystery that, when solved, can yield interesting
discoveries. For example, the AraC-like regulator MarR
binds salicylate (an aspirin metabolite) to activate multiple
genes conferring antibiotic resistance.

CHAPTER 10

Thought Question

10.6 When the lacI gene of E. coli is missing because of
mutation, the lacZYA operon is highly expressed regardless of
whether lactose is present in the medium. Based on Figure 10.14
and its illustration of arabinose operon expression, what would
happen to araBAD expression if AraC was missing? Why?

Repression of Anabolic
(Biosynthetic) Pathways

Repressing biosynthetic pathways is fundamentally different
from repressing catabolic (degradative) systems. Repressor
proteins that control catabolic pathways, such as lactose degradation, typically bind the initial substrate or a closely related
product (for example, allolactose in the case of the lac operon).
Binding the substrate decreases repressor protein affinity for
operator DNA. Thus, increased concentration of the substrate
or inducer actually removes the repressor from the operator
and derepresses expression of the operon. This derepression
makes sense because the cell “wants” to make the enzymes
that use the substrate as a carbon and energy source.

In contrast, genes encoding biosynthetic enzymes are regulated by repressors (called inactive aporepressors) that must
bind the end product of the pathway (for example, tryptophan
for the trp operon) to become active repressors. The pathway product that binds the aporepressor is called a corepressor. Binding of the corepressor (end product) to the repressor
increases the repressor’s affinity for the operator sequence
upstream of the target gene or operon. As the concentration
of end product, such as an amino acid or nucleotide, increases
in the cell beyond what is needed to support growth, the cell
will shut the biosynthetic pathway down and not waste energy
making a superfluous pathway or compound.

The Tryptophan Operon:
Repression and Attenuation

As just noted, many amino acid biosynthetic pathways are
controlled by transcriptional repression, in which a repressor protein binds to a DNA operator sequence to prevent
transcription. For instance, when internal tryptophan levels exceed cellular needs, the excess tryptophan (acting as
a corepressor) will bind to an inactive repressor protein,
TrpR, converting it to an active repressor (Fig. 10.15).
Holorepressor
TrpR repressor then binds to an operator DNA sequence
positioned upstream of the tryptophan (trp) operon,

Repression, however, is not the whole story in regulating the trp operon. Many amino acid biosynthetic operons,
including the trp operon, have adopted a second strategy
for down-regulating tryptophan synthesis, which can be
used alone or in conjunction with repression. This second
mechanism is called transcriptional attenuation. Attenuation uses the ribosome as a sensor of amino acid levels. It is a transcriptional control mechanism in which the
ability to translate part of an mRNA determines whether
the transcribing RNA polymerase can continue transcription. Because attenuation halts transcription in progress, it
affords an even quicker response to changing amino acid
levels than does simple repression.
Transcriptional attenuation was discovered by Charles
Yanofsky (Fig. 10.16A ) and his colleagues at Stanford
University. While examining the beginning of the trp operon
in E. coli, they discovered an odd DNA region, called the
leader sequence, located between the trp operator and trpE,
the first structural gene of the operon. The leader sequence
encodes a short peptide, but the peptide has no enzymatic
function. Its main, if not only, role is “to be or not to be.”
Key features of the leader sequence include a pair of tryptophan codons (UGGUGG), a translational stop codon, and

four complementary nucleotide stretches within the leader
mRNA. These regions, numbered 1–4, can base-pair to
form competing stem loop structures (Fig. 10.16B). Two of
the stem loop structures are critical to the mechanism. These
are the anti-attenuator stem loop formed by regions 2 and
3 and the attenuator stem loop (or terminator stem loop)
formed by regions 3 and 4. If the 3:4 attenuator stem loop
forms, then RNA polymerase is ejected and transcription
stops (Fig. 10.16C). Formation of the 2:3 anti-attenuator
stem loop, however, prevents formation of the 3:4 stem loop
because the 2:3 stem is longer and more thermodynamically stable than the 3:4 stem. The anti-attenuator stem, if
it forms, allows RNA polymerase to transcribe into trpE
(Fig. 10.16D). But what controls which stem loop forms?
High tryptophan levels. Because the ribosome is very large,
it can barrel through RNA stem loop structures. When the
cell is replete with charged tryptophanyl-tRNA and needs
no more (Fig. 10.16C), the ribosome quickly translates
through the key tryptophan codons in the leader sequence
but runs into a translation stop codon between regions
1 and 2. The ribosome stops in this position, enveloping
region 2 and preventing formation of the 2:3 stem. As a
result, once RNA polymerase transcribes through region 4,
the 3:4 attenuator stem snaps together. The attenuator stem
then interacts with the RNA polymerase ahead of it and
halts transcription. As you would expect, the ribosome dissociates after reaching the region 2 stop codon, but because
the 3:4 stem loop is already in place, the anti-attenuator
2:3 stem loop does not form. Subsequent ribosome release
leads to formation of a 1:2 stem structure, precluding all
possibility of regions 2 and 3 annealing.
Low tryptophan levels. However, if the level of charged
tryptophanyl-tRNA is low (Fig. 10.16D), then the ribosome following behind RNA polymerase stalls over the
tryptophan codons. Because these codons occur right at
the beginning of region 1, the ribosome does not cover
region 2. So, as soon as RNA polymerase transcribes
region 3, the 2:3 anti-attenuator stem loop forms and stops
formation of the 3:4 attenuator stem loop. The result is that
RNA polymerase can continue into the structural genes,
and ultimately more tryptophan is made. (A new ribosome
binds to a ribosome-binding site at the trpE message.)
Realize that for the trp operon, attenuation is a finetuning mechanism. The repressor provides the majority of
control. However, transcriptional attenuation is a common
regulatory strategy used to control many operons that code
for amino acid biosynthesis. Note that even though translation is part of the attenuation control mechanism, attenuation is not considered translational control. The reason is
that RNA polymerase, rather than the ribosome, is the target of the control. An example of translational control is
discussed shortly.

The Stringent Response

During transitions from nutrient-rich to nutrient-poor conditions, microbes must contend with dramatic fluctuations
in growth rate. This variation presents a problem. When a
cell is growing rapidly, its molecular machinery is geared
for peak performance. The pace of synthesizing new ribosomes is frenetic, trying to keep up with rapid cell division.
The more ribosomes a cell contains, the faster that cell can
make new proteins and the faster it can grow. But what happens when the party’s over—when poor carbon and energy
sources cannot supply enough energy to maintain rapid
cell division? Without a way of curbing ribosome construction, cells would soon fill with idle ribosomes. Under these
conditions, bacteria undergo a process called the stringent
response. The stringent response causes a decrease in the
number of rRNA transcripts made for ribosome assembly
and alters the expression of numerous other genes.
In the stringent-response strategy, idling ribosomes produce a small signaling molecule called guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp), which interacts with RNA polymerase and
lowers the enzyme’s ability to transcribe genes encoding
ribosomal RNA (Fig. 10.17). How is ppGpp made? When
an uncharged tRNA binds at the ribosome A site, which can
happen during amino acid starvation, a ribosome-associated
protein called RelA transfers phosphate from ATP to GTP to
form ppGpp. This signal nucleotide interacts with the beta
subunit of RNA polymerase and diminishes its recognition
of promoters for operons producing rRNA and tRNA. The
result is the down-regulation of rRNA and tRNA synthesis.
The less rRNA there is available for building ribosomes, the
fewer ribosomes will be produced.
This raises another question. Even though the synthesis of ribosomal RNA has been curtailed, won’t the cell

continue to waste resources on the synthesis of ribosomal
proteins? It turns out that some ribosomal proteins can bind
to the mRNA that encodes them and inhibit translation. So,
when rRNA levels in the cell are low, free ribosomal proteins
accumulate in the cytoplasm, unassociated with ribosomes.
These excess ribosomal proteins begin to bind to their own
mRNA molecules and inhibit the translation of their own
coding regions, as well as the coding regions of other ribosomal proteins residing on the same polycistronic mRNA.
This process is called translational control because regulation affects the translation of an mRNA by ribosomes rather
than transcription by RNA polymerase.

DNA-binding proteins often recognize symmetrical
DNA sequences.
The lacZYA operon of E. coli is controlled by repression and activation. The tetrameric LacI repressor
binds operator DNA sequences to prevent RNA polymerase from accessing the promoter. Allolactose (rearranged lactose) binds LacI, reduces repressor affinity for
the operator, and allows induction of the operon.
The cAMP-CRP complex activates lacZYA transcription by interacting with the C-terminal domain of the
RNA polymerase alpha subunit. cAMP-CRP regulates
many types of operons.
In catabolite repression, a preferred carbon source (for example, glucose) prevents
the induction of an operon (for example,
lac) that enables catabolism of a different
carbon source (lactose). Glucose transport
through the phosphotransferase system
causes catabolite repression by inhibiting
LacY permease activity (inducer exclusion)
and lowers cAMP levels.
Many anabolic pathway genes (for
example, for tryptophan biosynthesis)
are repressed by the end product of the
pathway (for example, the amino acid),
which binds to a corepressor that inhibits transcription.
AraC-like proteins are a large family
of regulators, present in many bacterial
species, that can activate and repress a
target operon by assuming different
conformations.
Attenuation is a transcriptional regulatory mechanism in which translation of
a leader peptide affects mRNA structure
to influence transcription of a downstream structural gene.

■

The stringent response is triggered during nutrient limitation when low cellular amino acid levels cause ribosomes to
idle and synthesize the signaling molecule ppGpp. Binding of ppGpp to RNA polymerase decreases synthesis of
rRNA, which slows the rate of new ribosome synthesis. The
overall rate of translation, then, will match growth rate.

10.3

Sigma Factors and
Regulatory RNAs

We have seen how repressor and activator proteins can sense
the substrates or end products of biochemical pathways and
influence the transcription of individual genes and operons. Might the cell also control the expression of large
numbers of genes by modulating the levels or activities of
sigma factors? And might RNA molecules themselves sense
changes in cell physiology and posttranscriptionally regulate the translation or stability of other RNA molecules?
The answer to both of these questions is yes.

Sigma Factor Activity Can Be Regulated

Many bacteria employ alternative sigma factors to direct
transcription of distinct sets of genes (see Section 8.2).
For example, many Gram-negative bacteria, such as E. coli
or Salmonella enterica, use the sigma factor called sigma
S (also called sigma-38, RpoS, σS, or σ38) to initiate the

375

Bacillus and Clostridium species such as B. anthracis
(anthrax) and C. tetani (tetanus) are soil organisms that
produce spores when nutrients become scarce. Sporulation
requires an asymmetrical cell division in which one of the
compartments, called the forespore, ultimately becomes
the spore (see Section 4.6). The regulation of this system
is quite complex, involving programs of transcription in the
mother cell that are separate from those in the forespore
compartment. How is this possible? Part of the answer is
that at the time of septum formation, when the forespore is
first produced, only 30% of the chromosome (the part near
the replication origin) is actually inside the forespore. The
remainder of the chromosome is slowly pumped in over a
15-minute period. The sporulating cell takes advantage of
this delay to selectively express different genes in different
compartments.
For example, sigma F is present in both forespore and
mother cell compartments, but it directs the transcription of select genes only in the forespore. Compartmentdependent activation starts with an intricate timing
mechanism that involves anti-sigma and anti-anti-sigma
factors (Fig. 10.18). Like all sporulation sigma factors,
sigma F is inactive when first synthesized. Sigma F is inactive because it binds to an anti-sigma F protein dubbed
SpoII AB that is cosynthesized with sigma F in the predivisional cell (Fig. 10.18A, step 1). After division, both
proteins become equally partitioned between the two
compartments. However, in addition to an anti-sigma,
there is an anti-anti-sigma F protein, called SpoIIAA

transcription of a variety of genes that promote survival in
stationary phase. In large part, Salmonella orchestrates the
stationary-phase accumulation of sigma S by modulating
proteolysis of the factor (protein degradation is discussed in
Section 8.4). ClpXP protease degrades sigma S rapidly during exponential growth. When cells enter stationary phase
or experience an environmental stress that slows growth,
degradation of sigma S stops. Sigma S levels increase in these
situations and trigger the expression of stress survival genes.
Other sigma factors are controlled by anti-sigma factor
proteins that inhibit sigma factor activity. Anti-sigma factor proteins target specific sigma factors and block access
to core RNA polymerase. The anti-sigma strategy prevents
expression of target genes until they are needed. For example, Salmonella uses an anti-sigma factor (FlgM) to time
events involved in constructing flagella. The transcription
factor sigma F is required to synthesize proteins used in the
final stages of flagellar biosynthesis. The anti-sigma factor
FlgM, however, keeps sigma F function at bay until membrane assembly of the flagellar basal bodies is complete.
Once complete, the basal body selectively secretes the antisigma factor from the cell. Secreting FlgM from the cell,
then, frees intracellular sigma F to direct transcription of
the final set of flagellar assembly genes.
Anti-sigma factors can themselves be neutralized by
anti-anti-sigma factors that bind the anti-sigma factor
more tightly than sigma factor does. The anti-anti-sigma
factor acts as a decoy to release anti-sigma factor from the
actual sigma factor. Freed sigma factor can then join core
RNA polymerase and direct transcription of target genes.
Many mechanisms can liberate sigma factors from antisigma factors. The next section describes one linked to a
cell differentiation event.

(AA for “anti-anti”), which is also equally distributed (steps
2 and 3). Anti-anti sigma factor frees sigma F from antisigma F, which is degraded by the ClpPC protease. This
is not a problem in the mother cell, because that compartment just makes more AB (anti-sigma), so sigma F is never
active.
These events occur in both compartments (forespore
and mother cell), so why is sigma F activation limited to
the forespore? Recall that at the time of septum formation,
one chromosome is slowly pumped into the forespore. The
gene encoding the AB anti-sigma factor is located far from
the origin and, as such, is not in the forespore immediately after septum formation (Fig. 10.18B, step 2). Consequently, no new AB (anti-sigma) is made in the forespore
during this time, and what was there is dislodged from σF
by anti-anti factor and degraded by ClpPC (steps 3 and 4).
Depletion of anti-sigma in the forespore frees sigma F to
act in the forespore compartment for a limited time. Liberated sigma F transcribes the genes needed for subsequent
sporulation steps. The gene targets for sigma F do reside in
the part of the genome trapped early on in the forespore.

30°C

Eventually, the spoIIAB gene enters the forespore and
replenishes anti-σF (step 5), and the next stage of sporulation begins.
Elegant proof for this model was obtained in the laboratory of Richard Losick, a leading scientist in the field of
microbial development. In Losick’s experiment, the gene
for SpoIIAB (anti-sigma) was moved from its normal location far from the origin to a position near the origin. As a
result, the anti-sigma F gene entered the forespore early,
continually replenished anti-sigma F lost by degradation,
and stopped sporulation.
The simple, unequal distribution of the chromosome
during septal formation is heavily exploited during sporulation to trigger differential gene expression in two different
cell compartments.

37°C—a set point that helps the microbe sense entry into
the mammalian host. The Gram-positive bacillus Listeria monocytogenes, for instance, causes mild gastroenteritis or serious meningitis in humans. When the organism
is ingested, it synthesizes a regulatory protein, PrfA, that
activates transcription of a number of virulence genes. The
prfA mRNA is transcribed regardless of temperature, but
its 5′ end contains a ROSE element that prevents translation until the temperature rises—after ingestion.

Regulatory RNAs

Are the regions of DNA between protein-encoding genes
merely spacers, or are they somehow important for regulating traditional genes? And what about the nontemplate
strands of genes? Do they have a function other than simply maintaining complementarity to the template strand?
A surprising fraction of a bacterial chromosome does
not encode mRNA, rRNA, or tRNA, but instead makes
untranslated RNA with regulatory functions. The laboratories of Susan Gottesman and Gisela Storz at the National
Institutes of Health (Fig. 10.20) were instrumental in

Regulation of the heat-shock sigma factor sigma H (also
called sigma-32, RpoH, σH, or σ32) in E. coli illustrates
how the synthesis of a sigma factor can be controlled at the
level of translation and degradation (Fig. 10.19). Excessive
heat, above 42°C for E. coli, causes proteins to denature
and membrane structure to deteriorate. All cells subjected
to heat above their comfort zone (optimal growth range)
will express a set of proteins called heat-shock proteins.
These proteins include chaperones that refold damaged
proteins, and a variety of other proteins that affect DNA
and membrane integrity. The transcription of many E. coli
heat-shock genes requires sigma H. So, one of the first consequences of growth at elevated temperature is an increase
in the amount of sigma H present in the cell.
The level of sigma H is regulated by two temperaturedependent mechanisms; one controls the speed (rate) of sigma
H synthesis, while the other determines its rate of degradation. The gene encoding sigma H is rpoH. At 30°C, rpoH
mRNA adopts a secondary structure at the 5′ end that buries
a ribosome-binding site, so rpoH mRNA is poorly translated.
The 5′ region of rpoH mRNA is called the ROSE element
for repression of heat shock gene expression. A sudden rise
in temperature, however, melts this secondary structure and
exposes the ribosome-binding site, allowing translation to
occur more readily. Thus, heat shock increases sigma H synthesis, which in turn increases transcription of the heat-shock
genes whose products include chaperones and proteases.
Proteolysis also controls sigma H accumulation. At 30°C,
the rpoH message is poorly translated, owing to secondary
structure, as previously described, but some sigma H protein is made. Inappropriate expression of heat-shock genes at
30°C is prevented by the DnaK-DnaJ-GrpE chaperone system, which interacts with sigma H and shuttles it to various
proteases for digestion (see Fig. 10.19). At 42°C, however,
proteolysis of sigma H decreases, and sigma H is allowed to
accumulate. Degradation decreases because at the higher
temperature, the chaperones are siphoned away from sigma
H by the many other heat-denatured proteins formed. The
new goal of the chaperones is to refold and rescue those damaged proteins. Chaperone redeployment frees sigma H to
transcribe the heat-shock genes, which include the chaperone
genes dnaK, dnaJ, and grpE. These genes also have promoters that depend on other sigma factors to drive basal expression. Thus, as the temperature rises, the amount of sigma H
is increased by two temperature-dependent mechanisms: One
increases translation by exposing the ribosome-binding site
(a so-called RNA thermometer), while the second redeploys
the chaperones that direct its proteolysis.
Many other examples of RNA thermometers exist, some
of which are involved in pathogenesis. Bacteria that infect
mammals have RNA thermometers set to body temperature,

discovering that regions between genes (intergenic regions)
can encode small RNA (sRNA) molecules (100–200 nt)
that affect the expression of many other genes.
In addition to intergenic sRNAs, there are so-called
cis-antisense RNA (asRNA) molecules. A cis-antisense
RNA is transcribed from the nontemplate DNA strand
that lay opposite an mRNA-encoding template strand
(see Fig. 8.20). Cis-antisense regulatory transcripts can
base-pair with cognate sense mRNAs and control their
expression. Regulatory RNAs help control a variety of processes, such as plasmid replication, transposition, phage
development, viral replication, bacterial virulence, environmental stress responses, and developmental control in
lower eukaryotes.
Mechanisms of sRNA function. Regulatory sRNA molecules typically affect gene expression after transcription
(posttranscriptional control) by binding to complementary
sequences located within target mRNA transcripts. These
hybridizations can either stimulate or prevent translation,
or affect degradation. Many but not all sRNAs require an
RNA chaperone protein called Hfq to stabilize the sRNA
and promote its regulatory effects on target mRNAs. Hfq is
a hexameric ring protein with sRNA- and mRNA-binding
faces. Table 10.2 groups sRNA molecules by mechanism.
Most known sRNAs inhibit translation by base-pairing
to a region of mRNA that overlaps the ribosome-binding site (RBS). Binding, therefore, prevents the ribosome
from accessing the RBS (Fig. 10.21A). Other sRNA

molecules can enhance translation by binding to part of
a long 5′ untranslated mRNA sequence located upstream
of an RBS (Fig 10.21B). Without the sRNA, the untranslated mRNA sequence folds in a way that occludes the RBS
and prevents translation. However, when sRNA binds the
target mRNA sequence, the untranslated region refolds to
expose the RBS (an example is DsrA). Ribosomes can now
bind the mRNA and translate the message.
Some sRNA molecules promote degradation of mRNA
by altering mRNA folding to expose an RNase cleavage
site (Fig. 10.21C)—for instance, RNAIII, discussed later.
The second mechanism in this group prevents degradation
of the message by binding to and occluding an RNase E–
binding site (the sRNA SgrS) (Fig. 10.21D).
Another class of sRNA affects mRNA processing.
Assisted by sRNA, a long, unstable, polycistronic transcript
can be processed to make shorter, more stable monocistronic mRNAs. For instance, an sRNA such as GadY of
E. coli, can bind between two coding regions of a polycistronic message and expose an RNase cleavage site required
for processing (Fig. 10.21E). Members of the last sRNA
regulatory group can bind to select regulator proteins and
interfere with their function (Fig. 10.21F). The sRNA—
CsrB, for example—can prevent the regulator from binding
to its DNA target sequence.
sRNA molecules expand the reach of regulatory proteins.

Large regulatory proteins (for example, LacI or TrpR)
typically control only a few genes, but their synthesis is

energetically expensive. Small RNAs can expand a protein’s
regulatory reach and, thus, maximize return on investment.
The benefits of sRNAs are that they do not require protein
synthesis to control gene expression, they diffuse rapidly,
and they typically act on preexisting messages. Small RNAs
represent one of the most economical ways to inhibit gene
expression.
One example of an sRNA molecule in E. coli is RyhB,
which regulates iron storage by expanding the reach of Fur,
the ferric uptake regulator. Iron is hugely important for
pathogens growing in the human body and for the quality
of soil, where it determines which communities of bacteria and plants can grow. However, too much iron increases
oxidative stress and damages the cell. As a result, iron content must be tightly controlled. In many bacteria, including intestinal E. coli, iron uptake is regulated by Fur, which
senses iron and regulates several genes whose products
either scavenge iron from the environment or store iron

in the cell (see Section 4.2). When intracellular iron levels
are high, Fur represses expression of scavenging genes but
induces production of iron storage proteins (Fig. 10.22A).
Fur represses gene expression by directly binding DNA
operator sequences in front of target genes. But how does
Fur activate iron storage genes? One mechanism is indirect and involves Fur repression of the sRNA RyhB (90 nt)
(Fig. 10.22B). RyhB sRNA is made when iron levels are
low (as within the human body) because the Fur repressor is not active. RyhB then helps destroy mRNAs of several iron-storing and iron-using proteins (such as succinate
dehydrogenase made from the sucCDAB operon). As a
result, dwindling iron reserves can be put to more productive use. When iron is plentiful, however, Fur will directly
repress ryhB. The lack of RyhB sRNA stabilizes the expression of the iron storage genes. Thus, succinate dehydrogenase is made, binds intracellular iron, and enables the use of
succinate as a carbon and energy source.

Figure 10.23 illustrates the mechanism of another

RNAIII forms hairpin loops that can interact with hairpin
loops at the 5′ ends of target mRNA molecules (for instance,
coagulase), one of which contains a ribosome-binding site.
Sections of the loops hybridize, block the mRNA ribosome-binding site, and inhibit translation. The RNA-RNA
hybrid is also an alluring target for a ribonuclease that will
degrade the message. RNAIII is expressed after the bacterial population reaches a certain density during infection

Cis-antisense RNA. We are increasingly fi nding that the
sense DNA strands from many protein-encoding genes
are transcribed to make so-called cis-antisense RNAs
(asRNAs) with regulatory functions. Typically, asRNAs are
700–3,000 nt long, originate within a protein-coding gene,
and affect only that gene. These features distinguish asRNA
from sRNA. Deep sequencing of the E. coli transcriptome
revealed the presence of about 1,000 different cis-antisense
RNA genes out of 4,290 protein-encoding genes. In fact,
every microbe examined produces asRNA molecules.
Different asRNAs have different effects on their target
genes. When bound to their sense mRNA counterparts,
asRNAs can engineer attenuator loops that stop transcription, prevent mRNA translation, or trigger mRNA
degradation. Even the simple act of asRNA transcription
can produce collisions between converging RNA polymerase complexes that prematurely terminate transcription. An example of the collision mechanism was found
for Clostridium acetobutylicum. The ubiG-mccBA operon
encodes proteins needed to convert methionine to cysteine (Fig. 10.24), but it is expressed only when methionine

ecules to fi ne-tune their physiology. One class of sRNA in
Archaea, called small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), is also
prominent in eukaryotes. The snoRNA designation was
retained for Archaea even though Archaea lack a nucleolus,
or nucleus, for that matter. Some archaeal snoRNAs help
guide the activity of enzymes. For example, one snoRNA
guides a methylation enzyme to methylate rRNA at specific
sites (Pyrococcus and Sulfolobus). Another snoRNA guides
the conversion of uridine to pseudouridine in rRNAs. A
second type of archaeal sRNA, called tRF, comes from
tRNA degradation. One example is a tRF produced by the
halophile Haloferax volcanii during alkaline stress. This
tRF binds to Haloferax ribosomes and inhibits translation,
thereby helping the organism survive high pH.
Archaea also produce sRNAs similar to those of bacteria, but their functions are largely unknown. One archaeal
sRNA (sRNA162) whose function is known inhibits the
translation of an mRNA that encodes methyltransferase in
Methanosarcina mazei (a methanogen). Numerous other

levels are high. When cytoplasmic methionine concentration is low, the RNA polymerase that transcribes the
antisense mccA gene will collide with, and stop, the
RNA polymerase transcribing the ubiG-mccBA operon
(Fig. 10.24B). The sense MccA transcript is not made,
and the premature transcript is degraded. However, when
methionine concentration is high, S-adenosylmethionine
(made from methionine) binds to the asRNA at the S-box
(a riboswitch, described next) and stabilizes a transcription
termination loop (Fig. 10.24C). The mccA antisense RNA
is not produced, and because the RNA polymerase making
asRNA disengages, there is no polymerase collision. The
ubiG-mccBA operon mRNA is completed, MccA is made,
and cysteine is synthesized. Evidence suggests that asRNAs
in bacteria have a broad impact on microbial processes.

Riboswitches Sense
Cytoplasmic Molecules

Proteins are not the only molecules capable of recognizing
and binding to low-molecular-weight metabolites. RNA
A. Translational
control

molecules can do the same thing by folding into threedimensional structures. These RNA 3D structures bind
specific target metabolites much as a protein binds to its
substrate. Because of this property, some RNA molecules,
called ribozymes (or catalytic RNA), catalyze enzymatic
reactions. We already discussed how 23S rRNA forms the
peptidyltransferase activity of ribosomes (see Chapter 8).
Other RNA molecules, called riboswitches, resemble activator or repressor proteins in that they bind to a cell metabolite to control gene expression.
A riboswitch is typically found at the 5′ untranslated end
of an mRNA molecule, upstream of a coding sequence. The
riboswitch can assume two alternative stem loop structures
that switch back and forth in response to a target metabolite
(Fig. 10.25). Translation of the message or transcription of
the gene can be affected. For a riboswitch that affects translation (Fig. 10.25A), excess ligand (an amino acid or vitamin) will bind to the riboswitch and stabilize a 3D structure
that sequesters a ribosome-binding site (RBS). The buried
RBS prevents translation of the coding region. Without
ligand, an alternative structure forms that exposes the RBS,
and translation ensues. For riboswitches that affect transcription (Fig. 10.25B), binding of ligand prevents transcription termination. The coding region is expressed.

A pseudoknot contains at least two stem loop structures that form a knot-shaped three-dimensional conformation.

Riboswitches can recognize a diverse set of ligands,
including amino acids, vitamins, S-adenosylmethionine
(see above), thiamine pyrophosphate, and magnesium. Ron
Breaker’s laboratory at Yale University (Fig. 10.26) discovered an unusual riboswitch in bacteria and archaea that
specifically senses fluoride, not a cell metabolite. Fluoride
has been used for decades to inhibit dental caries, but it is
also abundant in Earth’s crust. The fluoride riboswitch was
found attached to genes such as enolase that are inhibited
by this halide. Fluoride buildup in bacteria will be detected
by the fluoride riboswitch, which triggers increased translation of the enzyme being inhibited. The result is increased
fluoride resistance of the microbe. Recent work has shown
that riboswitches can also regulate expression of noncoding
RNAs and control access to transcription termination factor
Rho or RNase E.

include temporary asymmetrical chromosome distribution between the forespore and the mother cell, and
anti-sigma and anti-anti-sigma factors.
Small regulatory RNAs found within bacterial intergenic regions regulate the transcription or stability of
specific mRNA molecules and broaden the reach of protein regulators.
A cis-antisense RNA is an RNA produced from the
sense DNA strand of a protein-encoding gene and

affects expression of only that gene. These RNAs bind
to complementary target mRNA and either stabilize the
mRNA or make it susceptible to degradation.
■

RNA thermometers and riboswitches are secondary
structures at the 5′ end of specific mRNA molecules that
can obscure access to ribosome-binding sites or transcriptional terminator stems. Conditions that stabilize
the secondary structures (cold for RNA thermometers,
and small molecules for riboswitches) will alter translation of an mRNA or prematurely stop transcription.

10.4

Integrated Control Circuits

The regulatory circuits outlined to this point have involved
mostly single-switch mechanisms. But microbes build on
these mechanisms by combining multiple switches with
redundant feedback controls that can form a kind of integrated gene circuit. Integrated circuits can send a virus
down alternate lifestyle paths (lysis or lysogeny), couple the
genetic and biochemical control of a metabolic pathway
(ammonia assimilation), or time the events of a developmental cycle such as sporulation.
The deeper we delve into the regulatory workings that
govern the expression of a cell’s genome, the more clearly
we see the hierarchy of control. Groups of simple control
circuits are collectively regulated by other, more complex
circuits. One illustration of this hierarchy was already presented—namely, the role of cAMP and CRP in regulating
lactose and arabinose catabolism. The lacZYA and araBAD
operons are each controlled separately by dedicated regulatory switches—LacI and AraC, respectively. At a higher
level, however, both operons are coregulated by cAMP and

CRP in response to energy status (whether or not glucose
is present and utilized). The systems we are about to discuss represent complex examples of nature’s inventiveness
and need for control.
The first example we will look at here actually has
nothing to do with transcriptional/translational or posttranslational control of protein production. It does illustrate the concept of two-component signal transduction,
whereby one protein (the sensor kinase) senses a change in
the environment and transmits a signal (via phosphorylation) to the second component in the system (the response
regulator). Two-component signal transduction systems
can be used to control transcription, but they can also
be used to affect the physiology and behavior of a cell
without changing transcription. The example we will use
is chemotaxis, the ability of a bacterium to move toward
environments favorable to growth and away from harsh
environments.

Chemotaxis: How Bacteria Know
Where They Are Going

Bacteria that use flagella to move do not simply dash about
“hoping” they will swim in a favorable direction (presented
in Chapter 3). They have a sense about where they want
to go and where not to go. Bacteria such as E. coli purposefully move toward certain amino acids and carbohydrates present in media. They swim toward these chemicals
by sensing their gradients. Chemotaxis is the ability of an
organism to sense chemical gradients and modify its motility in response.
Before we discuss how these chemical gradients are
sensed, let’s first talk about how bacteria can change direction. Recall that the flagellar motor can rotate clockwise or
counterclockwise (see Section 3.6, Fig. 3.44) and that, on
any one bacterium, all motors coordinate their rotations.
Thus, all flagellar motors on a single cell will rotate clockwise (or counterclockwise), and then suddenly switch to
the opposite rotation. In the counterclockwise mode, all
flagella sweep behind the cell, forming a rotating bundle
that propels the organism forward in what is called smooth
swimming or a “run.” When flagellar rotors suddenly
switch to a clockwise rotation, the bundle is disrupted and
the bacterium “tumbles” in a random fashion. Once the
flagellar rotors switch back to counterclockwise rotation,
the bacterium will have reoriented itself in a different position, changing its swimming direction.
The key to chemotaxis is a mechanism that suppresses
the number of tumbles an organism makes when it moves
from a lower to higher concentration of an attractant chemical. For instance, an organism moving toward an attractant

may tumble only twice in 5 seconds. In contrast, an organism moving in the wrong direction (that is, toward a lower
concentration of attractant) may tumble eight times in 5
seconds. If, all of a sudden, the organism finds itself going
in the right direction, the sensory transduction system will
suppress the number of tumbles that occur, and the cell
will continue moving in the right direction.
This is the same strategy you use to find a hamburger
that you can smell cooking on a grill in your neighborhood
but cannot see. You randomly walk around until the smell
gets stronger, and then you keep moving in that direction
until someone hands you a burger.
How does the bacterium suppress tumble frequency?
Let’s start at the end of the system and work backward. The
natural bias of the flagellar rotor is counterclockwise rotation (in other words, smooth swimming). In order to tumble, the cell phosphorylates a protein called CheY. CheY-P
interacts with a rotor protein and flips the rotor in reverse
to turn clockwise (Fig. 10.27 , step 1). CheA protein is
the kinase that phosphorylates CheY and is the “key” to
chemotaxis. The more CheA kinase activity there is, the
more CheY-P is made, resulting in a higher frequency of
tumbling (reorienting) events. Another protein, CheZ,
continually dephosphorylates CheY. When E. coli senses an
attractant chemical like an amino acid at the cell surface,
the result is decreased CheA kinase activity, which leads to
lower CheY-P levels. The presence of fewer CheY-P molecules allows longer periods of counterclockwise rotation
and, consequently, extended smooth swimming toward the
attractant.
All this makes sense, but how does a cell “know” that it
has moved into an area with attractant? The answer begins
with clusters of special membrane-spanning proteins called
methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs, or chemoreceptors) located at the poles of E. coli and other bacteria (Fig. 10.27, step 1). The periplasmic domains of
different MCPs bind to different attractant molecules that
flow into the periplasm as the cell moves. The cytoplasmic
domain of each MCP binds to the CheA kinase noted earlier (via an intermediary protein, CheW) and controls CheA
activity. When a chemoattractant chemical, such as serine,
binds to the periplasmic side of the MCP, the conformation of the cytoplasmic domain changes and inhibits CheA
kinase activity (step 2). The CheY-P level then decreases
(because CheZ continues to dephosphorylate CheY-P), and
smooth swimming ensues.
This, too, makes sense when an organism first encounters a chemoattractant, but how does the cell know to keep
moving into even higher concentrations? As it happens, the
conformational change in the MCP that inactivates CheA
kinase activity also subjects the cytoplasmic side of the
MCP to methylation (via S-adenosylmethionine) by CheR

methylase (Fig. 10.27, step 3). Methylation of glutamate
residues in the cytoplasmic struts of the MCP reactivates
the CheA kinase but desensitizes the MCP so that an even
higher concentration of attractant must be present in order
to bind the MCP and inhibit CheA kinase. So, if the organism is moving into a higher concentration of attractant,
CheA is again inactivated, tumbling is suppressed, and the
cell prolongs the run. If it is not moving into higher concentrations of attractant, CheY-P is made again and the
organism will tumble. If the bacterium moves to a lower
concentration of attractant, the cell will keep tumbling at
a high frequency until it moves back into a higher concentration, at which point tumbling is suppressed to allow a
smooth run.
When the cell moves away from attractant, the methylation switch is reset by another protein, CheB-P, which
removes methyl groups so that the system is resensitized
to attractant (Fig. 10.27, step 4). The system is elegantly
fine-tuned in that CheA kinase is also the protein that

phosphorylates CheB. So, as the cell moves away from
attractant, CheA kinase phosphorylates CheY to produce
tumble, and it phosphorylates CheB to reset the sensitization switch.
MCP sensory proteins are not uniformly distributed
around the cell surface, but assemble as clusters at both
poles of E. coli. This clustering seems logical because the
bacterium points with its pole in the direction it swims.
Karen Lipkow (Cambridge Systems Biology Centre, University of Cambridge) and Peijun Zhang (University of
Pittsburgh) have used computer modeling and cryo-EM
tomography, respectively, to image the dynamics of chemotactic signaling and chemosensory arrays (Fig. 10.28).
Figure 10.28A depicts one such MCP cluster (yellow) at
one pole of the bacterium and illustrates the diffusion of
CheY-P toward the opposite pole. CheY-P will interact with
flagellar rotors all along the cell surface, causing tumble.

It is interesting to note that while the basic chemotactic
mechanism is evolutionarily conserved in bacteria, different genera use it differently. In the Gram-positive Bacillus
subtilis, for example, ligand binding to an MCP stimulates
CheA kinase, and CheY-P stimulates counterclockwise flagellar rotation and, thus, extended runs. This mechanism is
the exact opposite of that used in E. coli.
Chemotaxis is important for some obvious and perhaps
not so obvious reasons. It clearly provides a useful survival
strategy in nature, keeping bacteria moving toward nutrient and away from trouble (for example, toxic compounds).
For natural commensal bacteria or pathogens, however,
chemotaxis can also be used to move the organism toward
a cell surface to which it can attach. For example, the intestinal lining can exude chemical attractants that, like a beacon, will lead the bacteria in the intestine toward the cell
surface where they can attach. In sum, chemotactic sensory
perception plays a major role in structuring microbial communities, in affecting microbial activities, and in influencing various microbial interactions with the surroundings.
Other important regulatory mechanisms operate without
affecting gene expression. One intriguing system involving
toxin-antitoxin modules is described in eTopic 10.4.

Thought Question

10.9 Using antibody to flagella, we can tether a cell of E. coli

to a glass slide via a single flagellum. Looking through a
microscope, you will then see the bacterium rotate in opposite directions as the flagellar rotor switches from clockwise
to counterclockwise rotation and back again (see Fig. 10.27).
Which way will the bacillus rotate when an attractant is
added? What would the interval between clockwise and
counterclockwise switching be if you tethered the mutants
cheY, cheA, cheZ, and cheR to the slide and then added
attractant?

Biofilms and Second
Messengers: Cyclic Di-GMP

To change cell physiology, some stress-sensing proteins
produce second messenger molecules, which bind to
regulatory (or effector) proteins and change their activities. We have already discussed two second messenger
molecules: cAMP (involved in carbon/energy metabolism; see Section 10.2) and ppGpp (ribosome synthesis;
see Section 10.2). These molecules freely diffuse through

GGDEF and EAL proteins? One hypothesis is that cognate
pairs of these proteins may operate at separate locations within
a single cell and generate localized changes in c-di-GMP concentrations. Multiple, focused c-di-GMP gradients could
produce different outputs in different parts of a single cell.
Other examples of integrated control circuits are found
throughout the microbial world. Regulation of nitrogen assimilation, for example, integrates physiological and
genetic controls (discussed in Chapter 15). A classic example
of integrated control involves the “lifestyle” decisions made
by bacteriophage lambda, which are described in Chapter 11.

Methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs) clustered at cell poles bind chemoattractants and initiate a
series of events lowering CheY-P levels. Reversible methylation or demethylation of MCPs desensitizes or sensitizes MCPs, respectively.
The second messenger cyclic di-GMP (c-di-GMP) is
made by numerous proteins containing a GGDEF amino
acid motif. Many cellular functions are influenced by
c-di-GMP, including biofilm formation and motility.

Gene switches can regulate “decision-making” processes in microbes.
Chemotaxis is a behavior in which motile microbes swim
toward favorable environments (chemoattractants) or
away from unfavorable environments (chemorepellents).
The direction of flagellar motor rotation determines the
type of movement. Counterclockwise rotation results in
smooth swimming; clockwise rotation results in tumbling.
Random movement toward an attractant causes a
drop in CheY-P levels, which enables counterclockwise
rotation and smooth swimming.

A discovery that fundamentally changed the way we think
about microbes was made during studies of Aliivibrio
fischeri, a peculiar marine microorganism that colonizes
the light organ of the Hawaiian bobtailed squid (Euprymna
scolopes) (Fig. 10.31). As discussed at the beginning of this
chapter, A. fischeri is bioluminescent but glows only at high
cell densities—a situation achieved naturally in the squid’s
colonized light organ or artificially in vitro (Fig. 10.31C
and D). What accounts for the dependence of gene expression on cell density? How do cells “know” they are crowded?
The phenomenon was originally dubbed quorum sensing
because it seemed akin to parliamentary rules of order that
require a minimum number of members (a quorum) to be
present at a meeting in order to conduct business. In the microbial world, however, gene regulation is only loosely associated

Bacterial genes are regulated by a hierarchy of regulators that form integrated gene circuits.

■ Microbial communication through quorum sensing. The lux system of Aliivibrio fischeri mediates that organism’s
bioluminescence. Synthesis and accumulation of an autoinducer (AI) trigger expression of the lux operon. The greater the cell number and the
smaller the container, the faster AI will accumulate. The resulting luciferase enzymes catalyze bioluminescence. The luciferase reaction, catalyzed by LuxA and LuxB, uses oxygen and reduced flavin mononucleotide (FMN) to oxidize a long-chain aldehyde (RCHO) and, in the process,
produces blue-green light. Other lux gene products are involved in synthesis of the aldehyde.

with actual cell numbers. Induction of a quorum-sensing gene
system really requires the accumulation of a secreted small
molecule called an autoinducer (usually a homoserine lactone, although Gram-positive organisms are known to use
short peptides). The more cells there are in a discrete space,
the faster the critical level of autoinducer is reached.
At a certain extracellular concentration, the secreted
autoinducer reenters cells and binds to a regulatory molecule. In the case of A. fischeri, the regulatory molecule
is LuxR (Fig. 10.32 ). The LuxR-autoinducer complex activates transcription of the luciferase target genes
that confer bioluminescence. Luciferase is the enzyme
that produces light in A. fischeri. The apparent cell density requirement can be bypassed by the simple addition
of purified autoinducer to a low-density cell culture. Many
other microbes use these chemical languages to coordinate behavior of the population (Table 10.3). For instance,
quorum sensing is used by pathogens to time the production of virulence factors for optimum effect on the host.

Quorum Sensing and Pathogenesis

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a human pathogen that commonly infects patients with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease

of the lung. The organism forms a biofilm in the lung and
secretes virulence factors (such as proteases and other degradative enzymes) that destroy lung tissues (and thereby
severely compromise lung function). These virulence proteins, however, are not made until cell density is fairly
high—that is, at a point where the organism might have
a chance of overwhelming its host. Made too early, virulence proteins would alert the host to launch an immune
response. The induction mechanism involves two interconnected quorum-sensing systems, called Las and Rhl, both
composed of regulatory proteins homologous to LuxR and
LuxI of Aliivibrio fischeri. Many pathogens besides Pseudomonas appear to use chemical signaling to control virulence
genes. These include Salmonella, Escherichia coli, Vibrio
cholerae, the plant symbiont Rhizobium, and many others.

Interspecies Communication

Some microbial species not only chemically talk among
themselves but can communicate with other species. Vibrio
harveyi, for example, uses two different, but converging,
quorum-sensing systems to coordinate control of its luciferase. Both sensing pathways are very different from the
Aliivibrio fischeri system. One utilizes an acyl homoserine

with other V. harveyi cells. The second system produces
a different autoinducer (AI-2), which contains borate.
Because many species appear to produce this second signaling molecule, it is thought that mixed populations of
microbes use it to “talk” to each other. Recently, Karina
Xavier (Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal) demonstrated that E. coli engineered to overproduce AI-2 could
manipulate the composition of gut microbiota in mice.
In the case of V. harveyi, specific membrane sensor kinase proteins are used to sense each autoinducer
(Fig. 10.33). At low cell densities (no autoinducer), both
sensor kinases initiate phosphorylation cascades that converge on a shared response regulator, LuxO, to produce
phosphorylated LuxO. LuxO-P activates expression of
small RNAs called Qrr1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 that promote degradation of mRNA encoding the regulator LuxR, which is
needed to activate expression of the lux genes. Thus, at low

attach to Vibrio anguillarum bacterial cells in biofilms
(Fig. 10.36). They attach and remain there because the
bacterial cells produce AHL molecules that the zoospores
sense. Part of the evidence for this interdomain communication involved showing that the zoospores would even
attach to biofilms of E. coli carrying the Vibrio genes for
the synthesis of AHL. The implications of possible interdomain conversations are staggering. Does our microbiome
“speak” to us? Do we “speak” back? For further discussion of molecular communication between prokaryotes and
eukaryotes, see Chapter 21.
This knowledge begs the question, Why would a squid
want to harbor this bioluminescent microbe? Buried in the
sand by day, the squid emerges at night from its safe hiding
place to hunt for food. In moonlight, the squid would appear
as a dark silhouette from below, marking it as easy prey for
predators. It is thought that the squid camouflages itself by
projecting light downward from its light organ, giving the
appearance of surface-filtered light to predators below.

At high cell densities, the autoinducers prevent signal
transmission by inhibiting phosphorylation. The cell stops
making Qrr sRNA and starts making LuxR (not a homolog of the A. fischeri LuxR). LuxR activates the lux operon

GENES AND GENOMES

SPECIAL TOPIC 10.1- - Networking with Nanotubes
Microbial communication by secreted molecules (quorum
sensing) is now a well-established phenomenon known to
synchronize group behaviors. But quorum sensing is a system more like a loudspeaker than a phone. Everyone in the
neighborhood, friend or foe, can potentially “hear” the signal. Another drawback to quorum sensing is that only small
molecules can be sent and received, and these molecules are
subject to degradation by extracellular factors. But what if
microbes had a one-on-one communication system (like texting) in which not only signaling molecules, but also enzymes,
DNA, or RNA, could be passed privately from one bacterium
to another without ever facing the extracellular environment—
temporarily changing the phenotype of the receiving cell?
Such a system was recently discovered by Gyanendra P.
Dubey and Sigal Ben-Yehuda from the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem (Fig. 1A). Using Bacillus subtilis as a model, these
scientists witnessed adjacent bacilli exchanging cellular materials such as green fluorescent protein (GFP), while cells separated by a very small distance could not. Electron microscopy
revealed how this was possible. Unexpectedly, the adjacent
cells were connected by small tubes called nanotubes (Fig. 1B).
These tubes were much larger (about 100 nm) than the bore
of an average pilus (about 5 nm). Not only were proteins transferred, but nanotubes also served as portals through which
DNA, RNA, and other molecules could be transferred. Unlike
quorum sensing, nanotube communications were private,
between one cell and another, although small, multicellular
networks connected by nanotubes were also observed.
Dubey and Ben-Yehuda found that nanotubes could also
form between different species of bacteria. Nanotube connections developed between two different Gram-positive species
(B. subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus), and even between
Gram-positive (B. subtilis) and Gram-negative (E. coli) species

(Fig. 2A). Figure 2B shows the transfer of GFP from a gfp+ B.
subtilis to E. coli. The faint green speckled cells in Figure 2B
are E. coli that received GFP via nanotube transfer from an
adjacent B. subtilis.
Nanotube transfer of proteins could prove very beneficial
to members of mixed-species biofilms. Imagine that one cell
type in a biofilm is resistant to the antibiotic lincomycin, while
another cell type is sensitive to this antibiotic but resistant to
chloramphenicol. Could nanotubes help cells exchange resistance proteins, thereby providing each with a transient antibiotic resistance phenotype? Figure 3 illustrates that transient
nonhereditary phenotypes can be acquired by nanotube
exchanges. Figure 3A diagrams how two cells—one expressing lincomycin resistance, the other expressing chloramphenicol resistance—can exchange resistance proteins and possibly
mRNA through the nanotubes. Figure 3B shows the result of
an actual experiment. B. subtilis CmR cells (P1) and LinR cells
(P2) were grown on LB complex agar as individual or mixed
patches (column 1). Patches were transferred to fresh media
containing the drugs indicated. Notice that only the P1 + P2
mixed cells grew on the medium containing both Cm and
Lin. To see whether the resistance phenotype was heritable,
material from the patch was streaked for single colony isolation on LB (no drug), and individual colonies (arising from
single cells) were tested for drug resistance. Amazingly, each
colony exhibited resistance to one or the other drug only, indicating that double drug resistance was a transient, nonheritable phenotype (not the result of DNA transfer).
This mechanism of directly sharing resistance proteins
could be extremely valuable to a biofilm under assault by
multiple agents or even microbes under nutrient limitation.
A report in 2015 from Christian Kost’s laboratory at the Max
Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology shows that nanotubes

immediate transfer of information and materials across
inherent species barriers. Moreover, molecules channeled by
nanotubes are protected from degrading enzymes and harsh
environmental conditions. Though untested, nanotubes might
also be an efficient defensive strategy used to kill competitors
by directly delivering toxic molecules.

Quorum sensing involves the synthesis, secretion,
and extracellular accumulation of small autoinducer
signaling molecules. Cells within a population sense a
threshold concentration of autoinducer and simultaneously respond by expressing a subset of genes.
Quorum sensing enables communication between
cells of a single species or between multiple species.
Pathogens use quorum sensing to time the expression
of virulence genes during growth within a host.

Transcriptomics
and Proteomics

The studies exposing many of the regulatory systems discussed in this chapter were accomplished by examining
only a small number of genes at any one time. Now, however, new technologies enable scientists to examine thousands of genes or proteins in a single experiment.

A pebble tossed into a pond makes a wave that spreads
and ultimately disturbs the entire pond. Similarly, altering
one biochemical pathway in a cell produces a physiological
“wave” that impacts, to a greater or lesser degree, all other
pathways. What typically initiates and propagates a physiological “wave” is a transcriptional change in gene expression.
Scientists now have the ability to see these events unfold by
monitoring the expression of every gene in a cell—simultaneously. The result is known as the transcriptome.
This global view of gene expression is possible using
next-generation, high-throughput DNA sequencing
technology (see Section 7.6). However, mRNA is easily
degraded and has to be converted, molecule by molecule,
into more stable DNA in order to be counted. Basically, all
the RNA is extracted from a culture of cells, and then stable RNAs (tRNA and rRNA) comprising the bulk of RNA
are removed by hybridization. The remaining RNA molecules are fragmented by sonic disruption, and the fragments converted to complementary DNA (cDNA) with

Proteomics

If all the expressed mRNAs in a microbe make up its transcriptome, then all the expressed proteins form its proteome.
Unlike the DNA genome, which is fixed, the transcriptome
and proteome continually change in response to a changing environment. RNAseq and gene array technologies can
capture what happens transcriptionally, but gene arrays do
not necessarily reveal which proteins are actually expressed,
because stress can change the translation of a message without changing its transcription. Thus, the level of a protein
can increase significantly without any change in the amount
of mRNA. In addition, proteins undergo posttranslational
modifications (for example, acetylation, phosphorylation)

Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The science of 2D

gels is described in eAppendix 3. Briefly, the technique uses
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis to separate proteins from
cell extracts in one dimension by their charge and in a second dimension by their molecular weight. When combined,
isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE display a majority of the
cell’s proteins in a 2D array, as shown in Figure 10.38 (some
proteins do not appear, because their quantities or solubilities are too low). The proteins are visualized by staining
with fluorescent dyes after separation. Subsequent computer
analysis of the proteome patterns obtained from cells grown
under two different conditions will reveal proteins whose
levels increase or decrease in response to the changing environment. Figure 10.38 shows a dual-channel image analysis that compares Bacillus subtilis proteomes from cultures
grown in a minimal glucose medium with or without amino

reverse transcriptase. The number of cDNA fragments
made corresponds to the number of transcripts present in
the cell extract. DNA adapters are ligated to each end of the
cDNA molecules. Each molecule, with or without amplification, is then sequenced in a high-throughput manner (for example, Illumina’s sequencing by synthesis) to
obtain short sequences from one end or both ends of each
fragment (corresponding to transcript copy). The reads,
millions of them, are typically 30–400 bp. A computer program aligns each sequence with its genome position (gene)
and then tabulates the number of fragments sequenced at
any one location. The number of RNA sequences (RNAseq data) found for a particular gene is proportional to how
much that gene was expressed.
Comparing results between cells grown under different
conditions, or between a mutant and a wild-type strain, will
expose how the expression of every gene is influenced by
the change. Figure 10.37, for instance, illustrates the effect
of sigma S on the expression of acid resistance genes in E.
coli. E. coli can survive pH 2 exposures for long periods of
time—a property known as acid resistance. This capability requires numerous genes, as shown in the top panel of
the figure. Tyrrell Conway and colleagues at the University
of Oklahoma used deep sequencing to quantify the transcript levels of these genes in wild-type and rpoS mutants of
E. coli lacking sigma S. E. coli rpoS mutants are highly
sensitive to acidic environments like stomach contents.
Figure 10.37 compares the expression of these genes
in wild-type (panels 2 and 4) and RpoS-deficient strains
(panels 3 and 5). Note that transcripts of all of these
genes are decreased in the acid-sensitive rpoS mutant.
Another powerful technique, called DNA microarray, can also simultaneously examine the expression of
every gene in a cell. For an organism like Salmonella
Typhi, the causative agent of typhoid fever, this requires
seeing more than 4,600 genes. All of this can be done
on a slide the size of a postage stamp. The microarray
technique is described in eAppendix 3.

ism’s genome gives us a wealth of useful information
and new ways to probe its physiology. One of those ways
involves mass spectrometry, which experimentally determines the exact mass of an unknown protein or peptide
fragment and uses that mass to identify the protein. The
process is easy for a single protein picked from a gel, but
new techniques make it possible to identify and quantify
proteins from whole-cell extracts.
To begin the analysis, proteins present in cell extracts
are digested into distinct peptide fragments with a site-specific protease (trypsin) (Fig. 10.39). The fragment mixture
is passed through an analytical column that separates peptides according to differences in hydrophobicity or some
other parameter (Fig. 10.39, steps 1–3). The column effluent is then directly fed through tandem mass spectrometry
(MS-MS) instrumentation (step 4). In MS-MS, each proteolytic fragment is subfragmented by ionization to produce progressively smaller secondary fragments missing one
or more amino acids. Because the weight of each amino
acid is distinct, MS-MS analysis can determine the amino
acid sequence of the initial proteolytic fragment (step 5).
Sophisticated computer programs identify the proteins by
comparing the amino acid sequences of each protein fragment with the predicted sequences of proteolytic fragments
from all ORFs in a genome (steps 6 and 7).
Can we also use mass spectrometry to quantify a given
protein in two different samples? Determining relative
quantities of a protein between experimental samples typically involves labeling peptides with isobaric tags before
MS-MS analysis (Fig. 10.40). Isobaric tags have two
parts: a reporter group and a balance group. The masses
of reporter groups from different tags differ slightly. However, the masses of the balance groups also differ, such that
all the intact isobaric tags have the same initial mass. Cell
proteins from different experimental samples are digested
by trypsin, and the peptide fragments from each sample
are collectively labeled with different isobaric tags. That
is, one sample’s peptides are all modified with an isobaric
tag whose reporter group’s mass differs slightly from the
reporter group of an isobaric tag used to mark peptides
from a different sample. But because each reporter group
is linked to a balance group, all tags for all samples have
the same initial mass (that is, they are isobaric). The two
samples are then mixed and run through MS-MS analysis.
Each peptide peak will contain representatives from both
samples because their masses are the same. Subsequent ionization of a single peptide will release the different mass

Concluding Thoughts

Transcriptomic and proteomic technologies have been
used for many microbial applications. One fascinating
example centers on the transcriptional events that occur
during the developmental cycle of Caulobacter crescentus.
This organism progresses from a nonreplicating swimming
form (swarmer cell) to a sessile stalked form that can replicate to make more swarming offspring. DNA microarray
and proteomic analysis have revealed several potential regulators of this complex developmental process. Bioinformatic
approaches have also been applied to human body odor.

Bacteria employ a vast array of regulatory mechanisms,
both simple and complex, to make survival decisions. But
do they possess cognitive ability? This is a controversial
idea, but one worth pondering. Cognition in its broadest sense is the process of acquiring, processing, storing,
and acting on information from the environment. Memory, for instance, is critical to cognition. Chemotactic bacteria use arrays of methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins
to remember where it is in a chemical gradient. The information acquired is then used to guide decisions about cell
movement. Two-component signal transduction systems,
prominent in bacteria, contribute to cognition if the systems cross-talk. Bacterial signal transduction systems crosstalk when a histidine kinase phosphorylates a noncognate
response regulator. Small RNA molecules also contribute to system cross talk by influencing disparate regulatory systems. Higher-order manifestations of cognition

11.1 Phage Lambda: Enteric Bacteriophage

How does an endogenous retrovirus
contribute to the human genome?

Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are
remnants of ancient retroviral infections and comprise about 8% of the
human genome. Major evolutionary
innovations, such as placentation, have
been associated with the co-option
of ERV sequences for regulatory functions. One human ERV
(HERV) subtype, HERV-K, is of particular interest, as it is the
most recently acquired HERV in the human genome from
which multiple insertions have retained protein-coding potential. Remarkably, HERV-K virus-like particles and Gag proteins
are readily detected in human blastocysts, indicating that early
human development proceeds in the presence of retroviral
products.
What do you find most exciting about the implications for
virology and human biology?
From the human development perspective, these results
argue that complex interactions between HERV-encoded
retroviral products and host factors fine-tune regulatory
properties of early human development. Moreover, HERVs
can rewire developmental networks via their functions as
promoters or enhancers for human genes. Furthermore,
HERVs are also interesting from a human evolution perspective, as they can be exapted (evolve a new function) in a lineage-specific manner as human-specific enhancers.

Discovery of Phage Lambda

Bacteriophage lambda was discovered in 1950 by Esther
Lederberg (1922–2006), pioneering bacterial geneticist at
the University of Wisconsin–Madison, and later Stanford
University (Fig. 11.2). At the time, it was known that some
kinds of bacteria spontaneously lyse and release phages, but
the mechanism, even the source of phage from within the
cells, was a mystery. The strain Escherichia coli K-12 had
been isolated in 1922 from a healthy patient’s colon and
was used for decades thereafter in teaching and research. In
1950, Lederberg was performing a genetic cross between
two strains of E. coli K-12: a standard laboratory stock, and
a strain that she had mutagenized with ultraviolet light.
After the two strains were mixed, the mutant strain formed
colonies that were “nibbled and plaqued” (Fig. 11.3A).
The plaques resulted from phage particles lysing the mutant
strain. The mutant had lost its lambda prophage and was
therefore susceptible to infection. The infecting phage particles came from the lysogenic E. coli K-12, which Lederberg had streaked across.
Further experiments confirmed that at that time, all
known stocks of K-12, the most widely used strain of E.
coli, were lysogenic for phage lambda. Lysogeny means
that the genome of a phage is incorporated into the
genome of the host cell (discussed in Chapter 6). As the
host cell then reproduces, phage particles no longer exist
as such, but the phage DNA replicates indefinitely within
the host, as an integrated prophage. The presence of
the prophage confers resistance to infection by the same
type of phage. Phage lambda is thus called a “temperate
phage,” rather than a “virulent phage” such as T4, which
always kills its host. But occasionally (about once in a million cells), a molecular signal tells the prophage genes to

make progeny phages and lyse the cell. Thus, unknown
to researchers at the time, a given tube of growing E. coli
lysogen typically carried about a million lambda phages
per milliliter. The phages released can form plaques on
a strain that is not a lysogen (has no lambda prophage)
(Fig. 11.3B). The plaques have a cloudy center because
some of the infected cells become lysogens, which start
growing up where the infection began.
Lederberg and others learned to “cure” the K-12 lysogen to eliminate the phage from stock cultures, including
most strains used today. Other notable discoverers of the
nature of lysogeny include French microbiologists André
Lwoff (1902–1994) and François Jacob (1920–2013). The
molecular basis of the lysis/lysogeny “switch” was elucidated by Mark Ptashne and colleagues (discussed shortly).

measure protein” (protein H). If we delete part of the gene
encoding the tape measure protein, the phage will assemble
a shorter tail. On the other hand, if the gene is lengthened
by addition of nucleotides, the phage will make a longer
tail. How the “tape measure” works is unclear.
With respect to function, the tail of all siphophages is
noncontractile (unlike the contractile tail of myophages
such as phage T4; eTopic 11.1). The tail tube has a tip and
tail fibers, both of which help the phage attach to its host
cell. Upon host attachment, the lambda DNA must uncoil
and pass through the entire length of the tail to reach the
host cytoplasm.
Genome. Phage lambda has a genome of 48.5 kilobase
pairs (kb) that includes about 70 genes. In Figure 11.5,
the left side of the genome encodes mainly components
of the virion, including head, tail, and tail fibers. Most of
these genes are color-coded to match their products, shown
in Figure 11.4. The right side of the genome includes
enzymes for key functions such as host integration, DNA
replication and lysis, and the famous lysis/lysogeny switch
(discussed shortly).
Within a phage head, the packaged genome is linear. The
left and right ends each possess cos, a sequence of 200 bp
that was cleaved by a terminase enzyme when the phage
DNA was packaged. The cleavage generated a staggered
cut or “sticky ends” (Fig. 11.6). As the phage DNA now
enters the new host cell, the cos sticky ends anneal together,
and their backbones are sealed by DNA ligase (a replication enzyme discussed in Chapter 7). The genome is now
circular, as the sealed ends form a long operon transcribed
“rightward” from PR , all the way through the virion structural components (Fig. 11.5). Another operon is transcribed “leftward,” from PL. Note that both the PR and PL
operons use all three reading frames, and that some coding genes overlap. Long mRNA transcripts with gene overlap in three reading frames are a common feature of viral
genomes.
Besides the PR and PL promoters, which function during
the lytic cycle, other promoters are used for key events of
the lysis/lysogeny switch.
During the lytic cycle, the circularized DNA molecule
undergoes several rounds of bidirectional replication via
host DNA polymerase (Fig. 11.6). The DNA is sometimes called a “theta form” because of the shape of the
circle while replication is in progress. The completed circles are then nicked (cleaved on one strand), generating
a 3′ OH end. The 3′ OH end of DNA serves as a primer
for rolling-circle replication. Rolling-circle replication is
commonly used by plasmids (see Chapter 7), as well as by
circularized viral genomes such as that of herpes viruses
(see Section 11.5). In the rolling-circle process, one strand
of DNA extends its 3′ end continually around the circular
template, while the 5′ end “rolls away.” The 5′ extension

suppose multiple phage particles coinfect the cell at the
same time. This event implies that the host population
is outnumbered by phages, and thus progeny phages will
have poor opportunities to find a host. For this reason the
phage has evolved a mechanism to avoid lytic reproduction:
The multiple phages express a higher level of CII, some of
which now evades the host protease and blocks Cro. When
CII blocks Cro, the fortunate host cell becomes a lysogen
instead of lysing. A phage genome integrates in the host
genome as a prophage, at the att site. The phage DNA
integrates with att by site-specific recombination—that is,
recombination between the backbones of two DNAs that
share a short sequence in common (discussed in Chapter 9).
The integrated prophage now expresses only a few proteins, including CI (lambda repressor). CI repressor prevents
the lytic cycle by blocking transcription of lytic promoters. The CI repressor also prevents superinfection by other
lambda phages. This is what happens to most of your intestinal bacteria between meals: the bacteria stay in stationary phase with their lysogenic phages repressed. The phage
lambda CI repressor is famous, because its binding to DNA
was the first protein-DNA binding event to be described
(Fig. 11.9). Mark Ptashne at Memorial Sloan Kettering
Cancer Center (Fig. 11.9B) showed how CI protein forms
a dimer that binds a specific DNA sequence. Each CI subunit binds DNA through an interaction between an alpha
helix of the protein and a major-groove sequence of DNA
(Fig. 11.9A). Similar alpha helix binding to the major
groove mediates the function of many genetic regulators of
animals and plants, as well as bacteria.
When phage lambda infects E. coli, what if the Cro control wins, instead of CI? Cro protein represses CI expression, thus promoting the lytic cycle. The lytic cycle leads to
lysis (host cell destruction, and release of progeny phages).
The circularized phage DNA replicates, first bidirectionally (Fig. 11.8, step 5, “theta replication”), and then by

synthesized and assembled to form the empty capsid (or
head coat), tail tube, and tail fibers (step 7). The cos end
of the DNA concatemer gets stuffed into a progeny head
coat (step 8). The stuffed portion of the concatemer is then
cleaved at the next cos site by a phage enzyme called terminase. Terminase also helps attach the filled head to the
tail tube. When most of the progeny phages have assembled, a phage-encoded protein called holin punctures the
inner cell membrane, providing a channel through which

the CI repressor blocks expression of nearly
all other genes from the promoters PL and PR
(Fig. 11.10B). These two promoters, particularly PR , express most of the phage structural
proteins and lytic enzymes from the circularized lambda genome (see Fig. 11.5). But
the number of repressor molecules present in
a cell is small enough for fluctuation to lead
to rare events. Occasionally, perhaps one in
107 cells, the CI concentration is lowered to a
level at which PR becomes exposed, allowing
expression of Cro. CI is further decreased by
host RecA, which cleaves this protein along
with many host repressors (Fig. 11.10A).
RecA is activated by DNA damage during
UV light exposure, so UV light can induce
lysis in 100% of a lysogenic population.
When Cro is expressed, this protein
binds to both operators (OL and OR) for the

CHAPTER 11

PL and PR operons, respectively. Cro regulates these operons during the lytic cycle and, at the same time, blocks
expression of CI from promoter PRM. Thus, no further
repressor can be made to block phage production, and the
cell is committed to lysis.
Maintaining lysogeny. To avoid lysis requires continual
expression of CI repressor (Fig. 11.10B). Early in lysogeny,
CI is expressed from promoter PRE. CI expression requires
PRE to bind CII protein. But CII protein is vulnerable to
cleavage by host Hfl B (in a high-nutrient medium). Hfl B
cleavage can be prevented by CIII, a protein expressed early
from promoter PL .
Once CI protein attains sufficient concentration, it activates its own expression from a different promoter, PRM. PRM
activation requires CI dimers binding to OR . Besides activating PRM, the CI binding also blocks expression of PR ,
the major lytic operon, as well as the leftward-transcribing
operon from PL. From then on, CI maintains its own expression while preventing induction of lysis. Lysis occurs only
when stress such as DNA damage activates RecA to cleave CI.
The full repression of lysis requires eight molecules of CI
in all: a pair of dimers at OR , and another pair of dimers at
OL (Fig. 11.10C). The two pairs of dimers actually bind
each other as an octamer, with DNA looped between them
(not shown). The multiple molecules working together
show “cooperativity,” a property whereby the binding of
two regulators is stronger than the sum of the individual
regulators binding DNA. Cooperativity increases the on/
off character of a molecular switch, lessening the occurrence of partial states in between. Other examples of cooperative molecular regulators are presented in Chapter 10.

Synthetic Biology

Within natural microbiomes such as that of our intestine,
lysogenic phages carry genes that offer useful functions to
their host bacterium. An example is the bor gene (found at
the right-hand end of the lambda genome; see Fig. 11.5).
The bor gene is not needed for phage function; it encodes
Bor lipoprotein, which resides in the outer membrane of
the host bacterium. The presence of Bor protects a lysogen from destruction by the serum complement cascade
(described in Chapter 23). The location of the bor gene
near the end of the phage genome suggests that it could
have been picked up from an ancestral host, by a process
of specialized transduction (see Chapter 9). In specialized
transduction, a prophage initiates lysis and picks up a small
adjacent piece of host DNA while copying its genome out
of the integration site. The host DNA is then copied into
progeny phage and is transferred to the next host infected.
Today, we use genetic elements of the lambda switch for
synthetic biology—in effect, imitating natural gene transfer

mechanisms to construct bacteria with functions useful to
us. For example, Pamela Silver’s students used a CI/Cro
switch to build a bacterial recorder that detects an environmental signal within the intestine. This kind of bacterial
device offers promise for future development of diagnostic
and therapeutic tools.
Silver’s bacterial recorder possesses a stripped-down version of the CI/Cro switch (Fig. 11.11A). The cro gene is
fused to lacZ, whose product generates blue colonies when
expressed on indicator plates. (Gene fusion techniques are
presented in Chapter 12.) But cro expression from PR is
blocked by CI repressor, which in turn is expressed from
PRM. Cro would block PRM—if it were expressed. The net
result is colonies that are white.
The same bacteria contain another fragment of the lambda
switch, the “trigger element,” in which Cro is expressed from
a gene under control of the antibiotic-inducible promoter
tetP. Now, suppose we add the inducing antibiotic (ATC)
to the bacteria. The tetP-cro trigger element now expresses
Cro, which represses expression of CI by binding PRM. With
CI expression turned off, the cro-lacZ fusion indefinitely
expresses its protein, causing blue colonies (Fig. 11.11B).
The blue phenotype recurs for many generations.
What happens when we put this bacterial recorder into the
microbiome of a mouse? First, to colonize the mouse intestine, the bacterium needs to include a selective gene for competitive advantage within the microbial community—a gene
conferring resistance to streptomycin. The mice are treated
with streptomycin (Fig. 11.11C) until the bacterial recorders are established. Then the researcher adds the test antibiotic ATC. After ATC is removed, bacteria are sampled from
mice fecal pellets. For up to 7 days following ATC removal,
blue colonies appear, showing that the bacteria record ATC
exposure and report it long after the signal has gone.
Other applications of phage lambda sound more like science fiction. In 2015, Ido Yosef and colleagues at Tel Aviv
University constructed a lambda phage that specifically
kills antibiotic-resistant bacteria, while sparing bacteria
that lack antibiotic resistance. The phage actually delivers a
CRISPR-Cas defense to its host, protecting the host from
phage lysis. In a different kind of experiment, physicists at
the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, used
a Cro switch to build an “artificial cell” on a DNA chip.
This partly biological device is used to study biochemical
networks relevant to medicine. There is no end in sight to
future applications of the familiar phage lambda.

The phage lambda virion consists of a head containing its DNA genome and accessory proteins, a
tail composed of an internal tube, and tail fibers.
Phage lambda binds to the host maltose porin.
Phage DNA is inserted into the cytoplasm, where
early phage genes are expressed.
Control proteins bind to DNA, leading to lysis
or lysogeny. Single-phage infection (Cro protein)
leads to lysis, whereas multiple-phage infection
(CII protein) more likely leads to lysogeny.
In a lytic cycle, rolling-circle replication generates progeny genomes. The progeny genomes
are packaged into head coats and then cleaved
from the concatemer; the filled heads are attached
to tails. Late-expressed proteins lead to lysis.
CII up-regulates expression of CI repressor,
which maintains lysogeny. CI then induces its
own expression, while repressing expression of Cro
and proteins of the lytic cycle. Human gut bacteria frequently switch between lysis and lysogeny.
The CI/Cro switch is used for synthetic biology. The molecular switch is built into biomedical devices.

Virion Structure and Genome

The influenza virion has an asymmetrical structure
(Fig. 11.12). Instead of an icosahedral capsid, the (–) strand
RNA genome segments are individually coated by nucleocapsid proteins (NPs). The term “nucleocapsid” refers generally
to proteins coating a viral genome and packaged within or as
part of the virion. The NP-coated RNA segments are loosely
contained by a shell of matrix proteins (M1). The matrix
layer is further enclosed by the envelope. The envelope derives
from the phospholipid membrane of the host cell, which
incorporates viral proteins such as hemagglutinin (HA) and
neuraminidase (NA). These viral envelope proteins join the
membrane to the enclosed matrix, maintaining its structure.
When a newly formed virion exits its host cell, neuraminidase
acts as an enzyme to cleave a cell membrane glycoprotein,
thus releasing the virion outside the
cell. Neuraminidase can be blocked
by the antiviral agent Tamiflu (oseltamivir), one of the main drugs available to treat influenza.

Genome of influenza A. The influenza genome consists of eight RNA segments,

each encoding one or two proteins. Each (–) strand segment must be transcribed to a (+) strand mRNA
with a host-derived 5′ cap and viral RNA polymerase, and a 3′ poly-A tail (AAA-OH3′) consisting of a
variable number of adenine nucleotides with a 3′ hydroxyl end. Two of the segments (7 and 8) are processed further to express two additional proteins (M2 and NS2).

expressed in the previous host, before the virions formed
and the cell lysed. Within the virion, each RNA segment
forms a loop, complexed with NP subunits that condense the RNA in a helix. (The helix does not involve
base pairs, and differs from the standard helical forms
of RNA.) The two ends of RNA are complexed with the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, poised for RNA synthesis early in infection.
Segmented genome. Influenza virus has a segmented

genome consisting of multiple separate nucleic acids, like
the multiple chromosomes of a eukaryotic cell. The influenza genome includes eight segments, each a separate
linear (–) strand of RNA encoding one or two products
(Figs. 11.12 and 11.14). Within the infected cell, each (–)
strand segment must be transcribed to a (+) strand mRNA
with a host-derived 5′ cap and viral RNA polymerase, and a
3′ poly-A tail (AAA-OH3′) typical of eukaryotic mRNA. If
two different strains of influenza virus infect a host simultaneously, their segments can reassort to generate a novel
hybrid strain. Because influenza genomes are capable of
reassortment, they can rapidly generate a new strain that
our immune system fails to recognize, such as the pandemic H1N1 strain of 2009 (discussed shortly). At the
same time, like the other viruses, influenza viruses continually acquire small mutations that can lead to new phenotypes with respect to drug resistance and host range. The
double threat of drastic change and subtle smaller changes
in its genome explains why influenza presents a huge global
challenge for public health.

Thought Question

11.5 Could the influenza genome change by recombination of
segments, rather than reassortment? What about the lambda
phage genome?

Given that viral infection requires all eight segments,
how does the assembly mechanism package exactly eight
segments, one of each? Until recently, EM imaging of influenza virions suggested that the RNA genome segments
are packaged at random, avoiding the energetic expense
of an accurate packaging mechanism. Random packaging
would result in a vast majority of defective particles. But
the relatively large eukaryotic host cell can produce 10,000
progeny virions, more than enough infective particles to
propagate the virus.
More advanced imaging, however, shows that, in fact,
the eight segments package precisely within the virion.
The segments appear to link to each other in order as
they arrange themselves. Figure 11.13B shows the evidence from cryo-electron tomography (a high-resolution
EM technique described in Chapter 2). Cryo-EM combined images from frozen unstained virus particles, whose

CHAPTER 11

structure appeared highly consistent (unlike those imaged
by earlier kinds of EM). The computed images show sections across the influenza virion, in which all eight RNA
segments stand side by side, like a bundle of sticks. Sections
taken from different depths through the particle reveal tiny
molecular connections between adjacent segments. Further experiments with genetic constructs and fluorescence
microscopy confirm that all eight unique segments link
together in a defined, reproducible pattern.
Reassortment of virulent strains. The key advantage of a

segmented genome is that it enables reassortment between
two strains coinfecting the same cell. Reassortment leads
to “antigenic shift,” in which a very different strain evades
the host immune system. Even strains that infect animals

such as ducks or swine may reassort their segments with
those of a coinfecting human virus. Influx of genes from
a distantly related strain can sharply increase virulence and
mortality. For example, the 1968 Hong Kong flu strain,
which killed over 33,000 people in the United States,
derived three segments from avian strains. Major epidemics
of exceptionally virulent influenza arise as a result of reassortment with genome segments from strains that evolved
within ducks or swine, agricultural animals that live in
close proximity to humans. In each genome, the “H” and
“N” numbers designate alleles of the genes encoding envelope proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, respectively. For example, the Hong Kong flu strain had alleles
H3 and N2 (which have since become prevalent in “seasonal” human flu strains).

GENES AND GENOMES

In 1979, in Europe, an avian flu strain was found to
have “jumped” into swine (the “avian-like” swine strain).
In 1992, a triple-reassortant strain was identified that
included segments PB2 and PA (encoding RNA-dependent
RNA polymerase) from an avian virus; PB1 (polymerase
subunit), NP (nucleocapsid), and M (matrix protein) from
a swine virus; and PB, H, and N from a human seasonal
strain of influenza A. Since the H and N envelope proteins
came from a human strain, the triple reassortant could be
transmitted readily between humans. Today, molecular surveillance reveals many emerging strains of human influenza
A that combine avian and swine alleles. The “swine” strain
in 2009 had alleles H1 and N1, similar to the pandemic
1918 strain (Fig. 11.15B). In 2009, prompt public health
measures such as quarantine helped keep the disease rate
low. Yet another reassortant avian strain, H7N9, emerged
in China in 2013. So far, these avian strains have been contained—but the next time we may be less fortunate.

envelope. Cleavage of hemagglutinin enables a small peptide called the fusion peptide to mediate viral entry into
the host cell (discussed shortly; see Fig. 11.17). The presence of the protease is one host factor that determines
which kind of host may be infected, and which tissues
within the host support viral replication. Host factors of
many kinds mediate viral infections.
Influenza receptor is a sialic acid glycoprotein. Another
important host factor for influenza is cell-surface glycoproteins that contain a terminal sialic acid (Fig. 11.16). The
sialic acid polysaccharide of the glycoprotein binds hemagglutinin, attaching the virion and enabling endocytosis.
The precise structure of the sialic acid host receptor may
determine whether a strain such as avian influenza H5N1
will spread directly between humans. For example, the
sialic acid connection in the receptor polysaccharide can
involve different OH groups of the sugar galactose: a linkage to the OH-3 (alpha-2,3) or to the OH-6 (alpha-2,6)
bond (Fig. 11.16). The influenza strain H5N1 recognizes
mainly the alpha-2,3-linked protein, found in birds. In
humans, the upper respiratory tract contains mainly alpha2,6-linked receptors; alpha-2,3-linked receptors are found
only deeper within the lungs. But swine carry receptors

■ Influenza receptors in different hosts. The avian host receptor
polysaccharide contains sialic acid with an alpha-2,3 bond to galactose, whereas the human
receptor in the upper respiratory tract has an alpha-2,6 bond. Swine receptors include both
forms of sialic acid; thus, swine can be infected by both avian and human strains and may act as
a “mixing bowl” for reassortment.

of both types. For this reason, swine are believed to act
as a “mixing bowl” for strains from birds and humans, as
well as swine. Thus, swine incubated the avian strain in
1979, and then allowed later reassortment with human-flu
genome segments, leading eventually to the 2009 strain—
which sickened both pigs and humans. Today, large swine
facilities are monitored for appearance of novel reassortant
strains.

The avian influenza strain H5N1 causes exceptionally high mortality in humans, but it is rarely transmitted from one person to another. More rapid transmission
could arise from antigenic drift, a small mutation in the
gene encoding avian hemagglutinin. Rapid person-toperson transmission of H5N1 might cause an influenza
pandemic with high mortality. That is why public health
organizations were so concerned when, in 2011, researchers announced that they had identified mutations conferring H5N1

Endocytosis of the influenza
virion involves a key step of acidmediated membrane fusion, which
offers a target for antiviral agents
(Fig. 11.17 ). As the influenza
vvirion binds its sialic acid receptor (Fig. 11.17, step 1), a host
protease cleaves each HA, forming a fusion peptide (step 2). The
hemagglutinin trimer now contains three N-terminal fusion peptides. A fusion peptide is a portion
of an envelope protein (cleaved
from hemagglutinin in the case
of influenza virus) that changes
conformation so as to facilitate
envelope fusion with the host cell
membrane.
When the virion is taken up by
endocytosis, the endocytic vesicle
fuses with a lysosome and its interior acidifies (Fig. 11.17, step 3).
The lowered pH (increased H+ concentration) drives H+ ions into the
virion through the M2 ion channel
in the matrix layer (see Fig. 11.12
for virion structure). The influx
of acid causes the matrix proteins
to dissociate from the NP-coated
RNA. M2 ion channel is the target
of amantadine, one of the first antiinfluenza drugs; unfortunately, most
strains today have evolved resistance
to the drug. Low pH also induces
a conformational change shifting
the C-terminal ends back and the
N-terminal fusion peptides outw

strain H7N9 to become a deadly pandemic strain?

Replication Cycle of Influenza A

The replication of influenza virus requires that the viral
components travel in and out of the nucleus (Fig. 11.18 ).
Several viral enzymes and structural proteins travel along
with its genetic material. As progeny envelope proteins are
made, they require transport through the ER and Golgi to
the cell membrane. The overall replication cycle is highly
complex—even in the simplified diagram shown here.

Synthesis of (+) strand mRNA. After the influenza virion

is endocytosed (Fig. 11.18, step 1), all the viral (–) RNA
segments are released in the cytoplasm (step 2). Each RNA
retains its coat of nucleocapsid proteins, as well as a prepackaged RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The NP-coated
RNA segments individually pass through a nuclear pore
into the nucleus (step 3). Within the nucleus, each genomic
(–) RNA segment with its prepackaged polymerase synthesizes (+) strand RNA for mRNA (step 4). Each mRNA
synthesis initiates with a 7-methylguanine-“capped” RNA
fragment (labeled “C” in the figure). The influenza polymerase obtains the cap fragments from the host by cleaving
them from host nuclear pre-mRNA—a process quaintly
known as “cap snatching.” The (+) strand mRNA molecules return to the cytoplasm for translation (step 5), using
the snatched cap to bind the host ribosome. The RNA segments encoding envelope proteins attach to the ER for protein synthesis and transport to the host cell membrane (step
6). The newly synthesized nucleocapsid proteins (NPs), as
well as RNA-dependent RNA polymerase components,

subsequently return to the nucleus (step 7). Other genomepackaging proteins (M1 and NS2) also return to the
nucleus.
Synthesis of (+) strand and (–) strand genomic RNA. Back
in the nucleus, the original (–) strand RNA segments also
serve as templates for RNA synthesis, without cap snatching (Fig. 11.18, step 8). The uncapped (+) strand RNA
then becomes coated with the newly made NP subunits
imported from the cytoplasm. The NP-coated (+) strand
serves as template to synthesize (–) strand RNA (step 9),
which also becomes coated with NP (step 10).
The NP-coated (–) RNA associates with a newly made
polymerase for a future cycle of viral replication. The RNA
is then complexed with matrix protein (M1) and nuclear
export protein (NS2)—proteins that were imported from
the cytoplasm earlier. At last, the fully packaged (–) RNA
segments exit the nucleus to the cytoplasm (Fig. 11.18,
step 11), where they approach the cell membrane for packaging into progeny virions (step 12).

Envelope synthesis and assembly. The envelope proteins

synthesized at the ER include hemagglutinin (HA) and
neuraminidase (NA). Within the ER lumen, these proteins
are glycosylated by host enzymes and then transferred to
the Golgi (Fig. 11.18, step 13) for export to the cell membrane (step 14). Within the cell membrane, the envelope
proteins assemble around a group of (–) RNA segments
complexed with their matrix and packaging proteins, completing the virion particle (step 15).
To exit the cell, the virion buds out (Fig. 11.18,
step 16). Viral exit requires a final step of host release:
Neuraminidase (the envelope protein N) cuts the sialic acid
link of the host glycoproteins (step 17), releasing the virion
out into the bloodstream. This host release activity of neuraminidase is inhibited by oseltamivir (Tamiflu), the main
antiviral agent currently useful against influenza. Tamiflu remains useful today, but resistant strains of the 2009
H1N1 virus have emerged, so we urgently need new antivirals ahead of the next influenza pandemic.
Experimental evidence. How do researchers figure out all
the steps of replication shown in Figure 11.18? A key technique is fluorescence microscopy, as described in Chapters 2

A infection was observed using MDCK cells, a standard
laboratory culture derived from canine kidney tissue. The
infected cells were simultaneously probed with RNA molecules complementary to four different influenza segments
(PB1, PB2, NP, PA). The complementary RNA probes were
linked to four different fluorophores with different excitation-emission properties. Thus, the positions of progeny
viral RNA segments (vRNAs) were detected and assigned
four different colors. The “merge” panel shows how many
of the different fluorophore positions overlap (white dots).
The overlap of colors from different types of segments suggests that vRNAs are already linking together as they exit
the nucleus (Fig. 11.18, step 11) and enter the cytoplasm
for assembly into virions. Such ingenious experiments continually require us to rewrite the textbooks.

Influenza virus causes periodic pandemics of respiratory disease. New virulent strains arise through reassortment of human, avian, and swine strains.
The influenza virus consists of segmented (–) strand
RNA. Each segment is packaged with nucleocapsid proteins. Segments from different strains reassort through
coinfection.
Nucleocapsid and matrix proteins enclose the RNA
segments of the influenza virus. The matrix is surrounded by an envelope containing spike proteins.
Envelope HA proteins mediate virion attachment.
The HA protein includes a fusion peptide that undergoes conformational change to cause fusion between the
viral envelope and host cell membrane. For influenza,
the virion is internalized by endocytosis.

■

■

■

Influenza mRNA synthesis initiates with a capped
RNA fragment cleaved from host mRNA. The capped
viral mRNAs return to the cytoplasm for translation.
Genomic RNA synthesis generates a (+) strand RNA
as a template for (–) RNA segments. Progeny RNA
segments are then packaged in newly made nucleocapsid
protein and exported to the cytoplasm, for coating with
matrix, host cell membrane, and viral envelope proteins.
Neuraminidase cleaves the sialic acid connection to
host glycoproteins. This key step of virion release can be
blocked by Tamiflu.

Human Immunodeficiency
Virus (HIV): Retrovirus

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus
(Baltimore group VI). As discussed in Chapter 6, a retrovirus requires the enzyme reverse transcriptase to copy its
RNA genome into DNA. Retroviruses are a large family of
viruses known to infect all types of vertebrate and invertebrate animals; for examples, see Table 11.1. The “simple retroviruses” have genomes of just four genes, such as
feline leukemia virus (FeLV), the number one killer of outdoor cats in the United States. Simple retroviruses generally cause cancer. The lentiviruses, or “slow viruses,” cause
diseases that progress slowly over many years. Lentiviruses
possess additional regulator genes that modulate host interactions. In addition, most animal genomes show evidence
of endogenous retroviruses, sequences from an ancient

retrovirus whose genome integrated and became “fixed”
by mutation, such as HERV-K (discussed in the Current
Research Highlight). Surprisingly, endogenous retroviruses evolve into essential parts of host genomes (see Section 11.4).
The most famous lentivirus is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). The virus HIV and its causative
role in AIDS were discovered by French virologist Luc
Montagnier, building on Robert Gallo’s studies of retroviruses. In 2013, according to the United Nations, 35 million people globally were living with HIV, and AIDS
claimed 1.5 million lives. Yet three decades of research have
yielded drugs that can prevent AIDS and eliminate HIV
from populations. And the virus is engineered to make
“lentivectors,” our most successful agents of gene therapy
(see Section 11.4).

History of HIV and AIDS

HIV is a lentivirus that evolved from viruses infecting African monkeys. Two major types are recognized: HIV-1, the
cause of most infections at present; and HIV-2, another
type that appears to have evolved independently from a different strain infecting monkeys. The virus is transmitted
through blood and through genital or oral-genital contact.
HIV can hide in the host cell for many years, with only
gradual buildup of virus particles, most of which are eliminated by the host. Eventually, however, the virus destroys
the body’s T lymphocytes, leaving the host defenseless
against many organisms that normally would be harmless.

The first U.S. cases of AIDS were reported in 1981. A
historical view of AIDS in the United States emerges in the
book And the Band Played On by Randy Shilts, adapted as
an award-winning film in 1993. The book and film show
how American society failed for many years to grasp the significance of AIDS because the syndrome first appeared in
societal groups considered marginal (homosexual men and
certain ethnic immigrants), although it spread to all social
classes. In addition, the virus proved extremely difficult to
detect and grow in culture. The discovery of HIV sparked
controversy because Gallo failed to acknowledge his use of
a virus-producing cell line from Montagnier, the first to
isolate HIV-1. Since that time, the two scientists and many
others have collaborated to develop a test for HIV-1 infection and to search for a vaccine (Fig. 11.20A). In 2008,
the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded
to Montagnier and Françoise Barré-Sinoussi (Fig. 11.20B)
for their discovery of HIV and its role in AIDS.
Thirty years later, HIV infects one in every 100 adults
worldwide, equally among women and men. In developed
countries, treatment effectively prolongs the life of people
with AIDS. Treatment involves mixtures of antiretroviral
drugs—all based on the molecular mechanisms of HIV
infection, described in this chapter. HIV treatment with
multiple drugs is called “highly active antiretroviral therapy,” or HAART. A surprising benefit of HAART was
discovered through humanitarian treatment programs in
Africa, such as the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR), initiated in 2003 by President George
W. Bush and continued under President Barack Obama.
The PEPFAR program showed that, in communities that

deliver HAART to all members, regardless of infection
status, the virus production decreases so much that transmission declines—and HIV can be eliminated from the
population. Thus, testing and treating an entire population could actually wipe out AIDS.
In the United States, since 2012 the CDC has recommended routine HIV testing for all people 13 years of age
and older. Individuals at risk for HIV can take one daily
pill to greatly decrease their chance of infection. But still,
infected individuals must take expensive drugs with side
effects, and the HIV eventually acquires resistance.
We need a vaccine, but decades of research have failed.
Why? The answers to this question are complex.
■

■

High mutation rate. The mutation rate of HIV is
among the highest known for any virus. Within one
patient, the virus evolves into a quasispecies whose different strains attack different organs and predominate at
different stages of the disease.
Complex regulation of replication. The lentiviruses
express a greater number of regulator proteins than do the

“simple” retroviruses. These complex regulatory options
of a lentivirus enable HIV to hide itself within host cells.

HIV Structure and Genome

The structure of HIV as visualized by TEM consists of an
electron-dense core particle (or capsid) surrounded by a
phospholipid envelope (Fig. 11.20C). The conical core is
composed of capsid (CA) subunits whose arrangement is
partly icosahedral (Fig. 11.20D). The membrane around
the core contains spike proteins, which join the membrane
to the matrix, as in influenza virus. The envelope forms
around the core from host cell membrane, when a progeny
virion is budding out. In HIV, budding out does not rapidly lyse the cell but has other devastating consequences for
cell function (discussed shortly).
HIV core. The core contains two distinct single-stranded

copies of the RNA genome (Fig. 11.21A). Unlike influenza segments, each of the two RNAs contains a complete “map” of HIV genes. However, the two RNAs can

have slightly different alleles arising from distinct replication events. Thus, the HIV virion is genetically “diploid.”
A nonfunctional mutant gene on one genome may be complemented by a functional allele on the other.
Each RNA genome is coated with nucleocapsid (NC)
proteins similar in function to the NP proteins of influenza virus. Unlike influenza virus, each RNA of HIV
requires a primer for DNA synthesis: a tRNA derived from
the previously infected host cell. The host-derived tRNA is
packaged in place on the RNA template, ready to go. The
primed and packaged RNA is contained within the core
composed of CA subunits. The core also contains about
50 copies of reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease (PR),
as well as a DNA integration factor (IN). Unique to type

HIV-1, subunits of a host chaperone named cyclophilin A
are incorporated into the structure—about one for every
ten core subunits. An HIV-1 mutant that fails to incorporate cyclophilin A can attach to a host cell and insert its capsid, but the core fails to come apart, and infection is halted.
The core is surrounded by a matrix (MA subunits),
which reinforces the host-derived phospholipid membrane. The membrane is pegged to the matrix by spike
proteins composed of the envelope subunits TM and SU
(Fig. 11.21B). As in influenza virus, the spike proteins
play crucial roles in host attachment and entry.

UC San Diego (Fig. 11.21C). Born in China in 1947,
Wong-Staal immigrated to the United States and then
worked with Gallo on the early discoveries of HIV. WongStaal now pursues gene therapy approaches to combat HIV
infection and is developing retroviral vectors for human
gene therapy (discussed in Section 11.4).
The HIV genome includes three main open reading frames
that are found in all retroviruses: gag, pol, and env. The gag
sequence encodes capsid, nucleocapsid, and matrix proteins;
pol encodes reverse transcriptase (RT), integrase, and protease; and env encodes envelope proteins. The gag and pol
sequences overlap, but because they are translated in different
reading frames (different ways to align the triplet code), the
ribosome expresses each independently of the other. During
infection, each reading frame is transcribed and translated as
a polyprotein; then, at subsequent stages, each polyprotein is
cleaved by proteases to form the mature products.
In HIV-1, the gag and pol sequences overlap, and env
overlaps with genes encoding accessory proteins, proteins that modify and regulate retroviral infection. Accessory proteins are unique to lentiviruses, mediating host
response and maintaining the long-term slow progression
of lentiviral disease. The accessory proteins are expressed
within the infected host cell and regulate the replication
cycle (Table 11.2). For example, Tat protein activates transcription of the viral genome. The HIV-1 genome encodes

at least six accessory proteins—a greater number than in
any other retrovirus. They are major targets for research
and drug discovery aimed at preventing HIV proliferation.
Origin and evolution of HIV. Where did HIV come from?

The origin of HIV has been traced back to the early twentieth century, based on genome sequence comparison
with related viruses infecting other primates, called simian
immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) (Fig. 11.22A). Sequence
comparison of different strains of HIV and SIV reveals that
an immunodeficiency virus actually entered the human
population more than once, from SIV strains derived from
related primates in Africa. It is thought that human consumption of primates for meat may have introduced SIV
strains that then adapted to human infection. Today, the
vast majority of HIV-infected patients show the HIV-1
strain M; but some people have been infected by HIV-2,
which derived independently from another SIV strain.
HIV is the most rapidly evolving pathogen known;
its replication generates about one mutation per progeny
virion. For this reason, physicians always prescribe a combination of antiretroviral drugs, with different molecular
targets. The hope is that if any one mutation confers resistance to one drug, the mutant virus will still be blocked by
another. This strategy of drug combination and continual
testing for resistance enables many treated HIV carriers to

remain free of AIDS for decades. But in some cases, recombination of different mutants can generate strains resistant
to multiple antiviral agents (Fig. 11.22B).
Within a single infected patient, the high mutation rates
generate multiple virus strains with differing properties of
replication, tissue tropism, and resistance to antibiotics.
This dynamic population of diverse mutant strains is called
a quasispecies (Fig. 11.23). The quasispecies forms when
an infective virion commences replication with rapid mutation and trait diversification. Many of the progeny virions
have sequences and tropisms so different from their ancestor that, in isolation, they would be classified as different
species. Different clonal variants of the virus colonize different tissues and organs. Virus types within a quasispecies may interact cooperatively on a functional level, by

serving complementary roles in the disease state, and thus
collectively define the traits of the viral population. But what
happens when an infected “donor” introduces HIV to a
recipient? Within the recipient, only one HIV type proliferates—close to the original type that generated the quasispecies. After this acute infection, the HIV population again
diversifies into the quasispecies. It’s as if a relatively narrow
range of genotype carries the HIV “germ line,” whereas
the mutant types sustain the infected state and maintain
immunosuppression.

HIV Attachment and Host Cell Entry

Like other viruses, HIV needs to recognize specific receptor molecules on the surface of its target cells. The primary

GENES AND GENOMES

receptor for HIV is the CD4 surface protein on CD4 T lymphocytes (T cells). The normal function of CD4 surface
proteins is to connect the T cell with an antigen-presenting
cell, which activates the T cell to turn on B-cell production
of antibodies (discussed in Section 24.2). Disruption of this
antibody production is the main cause of the AIDS-related
susceptibility to opportunistic infections. Note, however,
that CD4 proteins appear on many other cell types, such as
microglia (macrophage-like cells in the central nervous system) and Langerhans cells (immune cells of the epidermis).
Their presence may make other cells susceptible to infection
by HIV.
Spike proteins mediate membrane fusion. The binding
of HIV to CD4 receptors involves the envelope spike protein SU (Fig. 11.24). Spike proteins are the main external
proteins accessible to the host immune system.
HIV attachment to the cell membrane requires a fusion
peptide rearrangement similar to that of influenza virus,
except that it takes place at the cell surface (Fig. 11.24).
When SU (gp120) binds to CD4, the spike transmembrane
component TM (gp41) unfolds and extends its fusion peptide into the host cell membrane. In addition, SU binds
to secondary receptors in the membrane called chemokine
receptors (CCRs), such as the macrophage receptor CCR5.
Chemokines are signaling molecules for the immune system, but their receptor proteins can bind viruses that evolve
to take advantage of them. After the spike protein SU binds

receptors and the TM fusion peptide inserts, the HIV-1
envelope fuses with the plasma membrane. A CCR such
as CCR5 is also called a coreceptor, a protein acting with
CD4 to bind the HIV spike proteins.
The requirement for CCR attachment varies among different types of HIV. Some chemokine receptors are found
on neurons, and their involvement in HIV infection may
mediate the neurological disorders seen in AIDS. Furthermore, the predominance of different viral envelope types
with different receptor preferences varies over the course
of infection. As HIV evolves a quasispecies, the virions target the CCR5 receptor early in infection, whereas laterevolved virions target a different host surface protein,
called CXCR4. These “X4” virions can infect early-stage
T cells that do not yet carry CCR5; thus the AIDS disease
accelerates. The X4 virions are less infective when transmitted; thus, most new infections start with a CCR5 strain.
An exciting discovery was that individuals who lack
the CCR5 protein because of a genetic defect show a
high degree of resistance to HIV infection. This finding prompted the Pfizer company to develop an antiviral
blocker of CCR5, maraviroc (see Fig. 11.24), which was
approved for therapy in 2007 (see eTopic 11.5).
After HIV binds to membrane receptors, how does its
genome enter the cell? The HIV envelope fuses with the
cell membrane, enabling the HIV core to enter the cytoplasm directly. This HIV entry mechanism differs from

that of influenza virus, in which endocytosis and lysosome fusion are required to open the capsid and release the
genome into the cell. The HIV core (composed of CA and
the host-derived cyclophilin A) dissolves, releasing the two
RNA genomes, along with associated viral enzymes, into
the cytoplasm.

Thought Question

11.7 How do attachment and entry of HIV resemble attachment and entry of influenza virus? How do attachment and
entry differ between these two viruses?

The two RNA genomes each possess a 5′ “cap” and a
3′ poly-A “tail” that enable them to mimic host nuclear
mRNA. Each RNA is hybridized to a tRNA primer for
DNA synthesis. The primer is a lysine-specific tRNA from
the previous infected cell. The primer might be expected
to hybridize at the 3′ end of the template, where its 3′ OH
“points” toward the opposite end, positioned to synthesize
all the way down. Surprisingly, however, the 3′ OH end of
the tRNA actually binds near the 5′ end, where initially it
can generate only a brief sequence. These early sequences
bind key regulatory factors for transcription and for DNA
insertion into the host genome (discussed next).

Reverse Transcriptase
Copies RNA to DNA

A retrovirus, unlike other RNA viruses, must integrate its
entire genome into the host genome in order to replicate
viral genomes and produce new progeny virions. Thus,
the RNA genome needs to serve as a template to synthesize a DNA complement; but then the original RNA template must be degraded and replaced by a DNA strand, for
host integration. All these processes are accomplished by
reverse transcriptase (RT), the defining enzyme of a retrovirus. Reverse transcriptase is the source of the high error
rate of retroviral replication—on average, one or two errors
per copy of HIV. This high error rate generates the quasispecies of different strains within an HIV-infected person.
Reverse transcriptase is the target of the first clinically
useful drug to treat HIV infection, the nucleotide analog azidothymidine (AZT). AZT is incorporated into the
growing DNA chain in place of a thymidine, but because
its 3′ OH is replaced by an azido group (–N3), no further
nucleotides can be added.
The reverse transcriptase complex actually possesses
three different activities:
■

DNA synthesis from the RNA template. Synthesis
of DNA is first primed by the host tRNA, which was
hybridized to the chromosome within the virion.

■

VIRAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY

■

425

■

RNA degradation. After DNA synthesis, the template
RNA is gradually removed through an RNase H activity
of the RT complex. Removal of RNA enables replacement of the entire original RNA template by DNA.

■

DNA-dependent DNA synthesis. To make the DNA
complementary strand replacing the RNA, the RT needs
to use the newly made DNA as its template. Thus, RT
has the rare ability to use either DNA or RNA as a
template.

As shown in Figure 11.25A, the RNA template with
its short RNA primer is threaded through the RT complex between the “thumb” and “fingers”—a configuration
typical of other RNA polymerases (discussed in Chapter 8).
The RT complex adds successive deoxynucleotides from
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) starting at the
3′ OH end of the RNA primer. As DNA elongates, however, the RNA template is cleaved from behind by the RT
complex. Thus, the new DNA actually replaces preexisting
RNA sequence. This “destructive replication” is unique
to retroviruses. The details are important, as they suggest
possible targets for new antiviral drugs.
Reverse transcription. Reverse transcription of the HIV

genome involves unexpected complications (Fig. 11.25B).
First, the host-derived tRNA primer initiates synthesis (by
reverse transcriptase, RT) of a DNA strand complementary
to the RNA chromosome. DNA is elongated toward the 5′
end of the HIV chromosome, generating a short segment
(Fig. 11.25B, step 1). The original RNA template for this
short segment is then degraded by the RNase H activity of
RT, leaving only the DNA extension of the tRNA primer
(step 2).
The new DNA primes the second template. The original RNA template had repeated ends (labeled “r,” lowercase,
for RNA in Fig. 11.25B), and the exposed DNA copy of
the 5′ end has a complementary sequence (“R,” uppercase,
for DNA). The “R” DNA from the second tRNA extension
hybridizes to the 3′ end of the original RNA (Fig. 11.25B,
step 3). The hybridized DNA elongates along the rest of the
chromosome (step 4), up to the primer-binding site (pbs) for
mRNA transcription. DNA completion is followed by degradation of the remaining RNA template, except for occasional
short fragments to serve as primers, such as the polypurine
tract (ppt). A complementary DNA strand is then synthesized through the PPT primer, leaving a nick at U3 (step 5).
Interestingly, human host cells have evolved a protein,
APOBEC3G, that deaminates viral cytosines and thus
increases the error rate of reverse transcriptase. APOBEC3G
can be packaged into progeny virions, decreasing production of infective virions in the next host. However, HIV has
evolved an accessory protein, Vif (see Table 11.2), that binds
APOBEC3G to prevent it from being packaged into virions.

Integration into the host genome. The fi nal step of

genome processing requires integration into host DNA.
The double-stranded DNA copy of the HIV genome (plus
a short repeat of the 5′ end) circularizes (Fig. 11.25B,
step 6). The circular molecule then integrates into the host
chromosome by site-specific recombination at a host target sequence (step 7), mediated by the HIV integrase protein (IN). This step forms an integrated viral genome, or
provirus. Integration generates two copies of the provirus
5′ end (sequence U3-R-U5), which is called a long terminal repeat (LTR). The provirus and LTR ends are also
flanked by two copies of the host target sequence. Proviral
sequences can now be expressed, directing production of
progeny virions.
An alternative to virion production is that the integrated
HIV genome lies dormant, like the lambda prophage in
E. coli. The integrated HIV genome is replicated passively
within the genome of its host cell, hiding for many years
with only infrequent production of virions. The few virions
shed by the patient, however, can infect an unsuspecting
individual who has sexual contact with or is exposed to the
blood of the patient.

Replication Cycle of HIV

The steps of HIV replication are outlined in Figure 11.26 . The main points of viral entry and replication are typical of retroviruses. HIV, however, has
an exceptionally large number of accessory proteins that
govern the level of viral production and the duration of
the quiescent phase, when the integrated chromosome
replicates with the host cell.
Synthesis of HIV mRNA and progeny genomic RNA. After

the HIV virion attaches to the host receptors, its envelope
fuses with the host membrane (Fig. 11.26, step 1). Unlike
influenza virus, the HIV core enters the cytoplasm directly,
without endocytosis (step 2). The core partly uncoats, while
the RNA chromosomes within are reverse-transcribed to
make double-stranded DNA (step 3). The double-stranded
DNA enters the nucleus through a nuclear pore (step 4)—a
key step facilitated by Vpr accessory protein. Vpr enables
infection of nondividing cells, which only lentiviruses can
do; other retroviruses, such as those causing lymphoma,
must infect dividing cells, in which the nuclear membrane
dissolves during mitosis.
Upon entering the nucleus, the DNA copy of the HIV
genome integrates its sequence as a provirus at a random
position in a host chromosome (step 5). Integration is catalyzed by integrase (the IN protein; see Fig. 11.21). Integrase inhibitors such as raltegravir are an important class
of anti-HIV drugs. Within the nucleus, full-length RNA
transcripts are made by host RNA polymerase II, including

a 5′ cap and a 3′ poly-A tail (step 6). Some of the RNAs exit
the nucleus (step 7) to serve as mRNA for translation of
polyproteins. Polyproteins are translated in alternative versions, such as Gag-Pol. Other full-length RNA transcripts
exit the nucleus to form RNA dimers for progeny virions
(step 8). Still other RNA transcripts within the nucleus
are cut and spliced to complete the env gene sequence for
translation of Env (envelope) proteins (step 9).
The Env proteins are made within the endoplasmic
reticulum (ER) (Fig. 11.26, step 10). They pass through
the Golgi for glycosylation and packaging (step 11) and are
exported to the cell membrane (step 12). At the membrane,
Env proteins plug into the core particle as it forms from the
RNA dimers plus Gag-Pol peptides (step 13).
Virion assembly and exit. The core particles are packaged
with envelope derived from host cell membrane containing Env spike proteins (Fig. 11.26, step 14). To escape the
host cell, emerging virions require accessory protein Vpu to
bind a “tetherin,” a host adhesion protein induced by interferon to cause reuptake and digestion of virions. Vpu causes
proteosomal degradation of the tetherin. Emerging virions,
some still tethered to the cell, are seen in Figure 11.27A.
As the virion buds off, the protease (PR) cleaves the GagPol peptide to complete maturation of the core structure
containing Gag subunits as well as reverse transcriptase
(RT) (Fig. 11.26, step 15). The Gag subunits now form
the conical core structure. Proteases that cleave Gag-Pol
offer important drug targets, which have led to the development of anti-HIV drugs known as protease inhibitors.
However, HIV has alternative means of cell-to-cell
transmission that avoid exposing virions to the immune
system. One alternative is cell fusion, mediated by binding
of Env in the membrane to CD4 receptors on a neighboring cell (see Fig. 11.26). The two cells then fuse, and HIV
core particles can enter the new cell through their fused
cytoplasm. The fusion of many cells can form a giant multinucleate cell called a syncytium. Cell fusion with formation
of syncytia enables HIV to infect neighboring cells without
ever exiting a cell. Another means of cell-to-cell transmission is to travel through a “nanotube” connection between
two T cells (Fig. 11.27B).
The intricate scheme in Figure 11.26 actually omits
many functions of HIV accessory proteins that enhance
the virulence of HIV infection (see Table 11.2). Mutation
of genes for accessory proteins often decreases virulence;
thus, these proteins are potential targets for chemotherapy.
Surprisingly, even a modest decrease of HIV infectivity can
have major benefits for the patient, suggesting that HIV is
so crippled by its high mutation rate that the slightest interference greatly decreases production of infective virions.
Thus, numerous effective antiviral agents are now known—
but all have side effects, and all select for resistant strains.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes an
ongoing pandemic of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Molecular biology has led to drugs that
control the infection.
HIV is a retrovirus whose RNA genome is reversetranscribed into double-stranded DNA, which integrates
into the DNA of the host cell.
The HIV core contains two different copies of its RNA
genome, each bound to a primer (host tRNA) and
reverse transcriptase (RT). The core is surrounded by an
envelope containing spike protein trimers.
HIV binds the CD4 receptor of T lymphocytes
together with the chemokine receptor CCR5. Following
virion-receptor binding and envelope-membrane fusion,
HIV core particle is released into the cytoplasm, where
it partly uncoats.
Reverse transcriptase synthesizes DNA from the
HIV RNA template, primed by the tRNA. RNA degradation allows formation of a double-stranded DNA.
Entering the nucleus, the retroviral DNA integrates
into the host genome.
Retroviral mRNAs are exported to the cytoplasm for
translation. Envelope proteins are translated at the ER
and exported to the cell membrane.
Retroviruses are assembled at the cell membrane,
where virions are released slowly, without lysis. Alternative

Endogenous Retroviruses
and Gene Therapy

Suppose an integrated HIV genome mutated and lost
the ability to produce progeny. What would happen to
its genome? The integrated genome would be “trapped”
within a cell, an endogenous retrovirus. If the cell entered
the host germ line, over many host generations in its host
the retroviral sequence would inevitably accumulate more
mutations. It could even provide the material for evolution
of a new trait. Such endogenous retroviruses inspired the
idea that researchers could intentionally manipulate a retrovirus to impart a useful trait and use it for gene therapy.

Retroelements in the Human Genome

The human genome is riddled with remains of retroviral
genomes, in various states of decay. These decaying genomes
are collectively known as retroelements (Fig. 11.28). Endogenous retroviruses (in humans, HERVs) are retroelements
that retain all the genomic elements of a retrovirus, including
gag, env, and pol genes. An example is HERV-K, an endogenous retrovirus that activates during normal development of
human embryos (see Current Research Highlight).

GENES AND GENOMES

Other elements, known as retrotransposons, retain
only partial retroviral elements but may maintain a reverse
transcriptase to copy themselves into other genomic locations. An example of a retrotransposon is the well-known
Alu sequence, a short sequence found in about a million
copies in the human genome. In some cases, a retrotransposon such as Alu can interrupt a key human gene, leading
to a genetic defect such as a defective lipoprotein receptor
associated with abnormally high cholesterol level and heart
failure. Still other retroelements, known as LINEs (long
interspersed nuclear elements) and SINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements), show more vestigial remnants of
retroviral genomes. Amazingly, retroelements and transposons appear to have generated about half the sequence of
the human genome.
Many HERVs and other mammalian ERVs are now
known to express viral components, such as reverse transcriptase, as part of normal host function. An example
in mice is an ERV participating in the B-cell immune
response to carbohydrate antigens (Fig. 11.29). In
mice, normal function of the B-cell response involves
B-cell antigen receptors, antibody-like molecules that
reside in the plasma membrane (discussed in Chapter 24). Like antibodies, B-cell receptors specifically recognize certain types of foreign molecules—in this case,
carbohydrates that might come from a pathogen. The
B-cell receptor signal requires a cascade of intracellular

signals culminating in B-cell proliferation and antibody
production. Part of the cascade requires induction of an
ERV to express retroviral R NA and reverse transcriptase. Both the R NA and the reverse-transcribed DNA
activate genes for antibody production. The requirement is demonstrated by treating mice with inhibitors
of reverse transcriptase, which consequently inhibit antibody production.

Gene Therapy with Lentivectors

The exceptional ability of lentiviruses to deliver their own
DNA to human cells makes them our most effective gene
transfer vectors. A gene transfer vector is a DNA sequence
that can express a recombinant gene within an animal or
plant cell, either from a plasmid or from a sequence integrated into the host genome. Vectors derived from HIV
are particularly useful for their ability to transfer genes into
nonmitotic cells.
The viruses used as gene transfer vectors are those
whose replication cycles establish a viral genome within
the host nucleus. Some of the first viral vectors were
made from double-stranded DNA viruses such as adenoviruses, which cause mild respiratory illness. An adenoviral genome enters the cell nucleus, where it circularizes
and replicates separately from the host chromosomes, in
a cycle similar to that of herpes viruses. Thus, adenoviral
vectors avoid the long-term risks
of inserting DNA permanently

coated with a VSV envelope protein

contains a human transgene that becomes integrated into
the host genome.
Could lentiviral integration be dangerous for the patient?
Lentiviral integration into host DNA poses the danger of
activating an adjacent proto-oncogene—that is, a human
gene that causes cancer when expressed at the wrong time.
To avoid this problem, lentivectors are modified so that
their promoters can activate only the gene of choice, not an
adjacent cancer gene. Furthermore, lentiviral vectors offer a
way to integrate DNA into nondividing cells of differentiated tissues such as brain neurons. For example, in 2009 a
lentivector derived from HIV halted progression of a fatal
brain disease, adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), in two young
boys. The lentivector inserted a gene replacing a defective
gene in each boy’s blood stem cells.
In a different case, in 2012, the first leukemia patients
were successfully treated by lentiviral gene therapy. The
HIV-derived vector reprogrammed the patients’ own T
cells to attack cancerous B cells. A 7-year-old girl, Emily
Whitehead (Fig. 11.30 inset), was the first child to be considered fully “cured” of disease by a lentiviral vector.

How a Lentivector Works

To construct a safe and effective vector, the HIV genome
is modified extensively. In the example shown in Figure 11.31 , accessory genes vpr, vpu, nef, and vif, which
encode HIV virulence factors for disease, were removed.
Other protein-encoding genes necessary for virion production were put into DNA helper plasmids, to be provided
only in tissue culture for vector production. These genes
provide the capsid monomer (gag), reverse transcriptase
(pol), envelope glycoprotein (env), and a regulator of mRNA
export from the nucleus (rev). The HIV env gene is replaced
by an env gene from another virus, vesicular stomatitis virus
(VSV). The VSV envelope protein has a broad tropism (host
range) and thus enables the lentivector to infect a broad
range of host cell types. Each helper plasmid drives its gene
expression from a well-studied promoter of another virus,
such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or respiratory syncytial
virus (RSV). The original HIV vector genome retains only
the LTR end sequences (R-U5) required for genome integration, a packaging signal from the start of gag, and the
infectivity-enhancing polypurine tract (PPT).

plasmids. Their expression is driven by regulatory elements from other viruses (red). Source: Modified from Blesch. 2003. Methods 33:164.

To express the transgene (the gene of interest for
expression in the host), a CMV promoter was inserted in
the HIV-derived RNA vector. To further enhance transgene expression, a genetic enhancer sequence was added
from woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV). Note that a “lentiviral” gene transfer system, in fact, includes genetic elements from a diverse set of human and animal viruses, all
found in previous studies to contribute specific properties
to infection. Although these genes originate from different
viruses, they nevertheless function together like parts of a
machine.
To produce infective virions, the HIV-derived RNA
vector plus the three helper plasmids are introduced into
a special tissue culture line. The vector and plasmids enter
the cells by a process, called transfection, in which calcium phosphate treatment promotes the uptake of nucleic
acids across the cell membrane. The host tissue culture cells
are derived from human embryonic kidney 293T cells containing a gene for a protein from simian virus 40 (SV40)
that enables the replication of DNA plasmids containing an
SV40 replication site. The 293T cells allow efficient expression of the viral genes on the helper plasmids, as well as
a full virion production cycle in which the vector RNA is
replicated and packaged into virions.

Safety of Lentivectors

The use of disease-causing viruses for human therapy raises
important concerns about safety. The viruses might express
toxins, induce cancer, or trigger a damaging immune
response. These concerns need to be weighed against the
risks of the conditions they are used to treat, such as severe
combined immunodeficiency (SCID), cystic fibrosis, and
cancer. In general, gene therapy is approved only for conditions that are life-threatening and for which alternative
therapies are inadequate.
Viruses used for gene therapy are engineered extensively
to decrease risks, using techniques of genetic engineering
presented in Chapter 12. Safety features of viral vectors
include:
■

Deleting virulence genes. Viral genes that promote
disease and virion proliferation, but are not required
for establishment of the viral DNA in the nucleus, are
deleted from the vector genome. To produce the vector
in tissue culture, the viral proliferation genes are provided on helper plasmids.

■

Avoiding genome insertion next to oncogenes.
Vectors engineered from adenoviruses are usually designed to avoid host chromosome integration

CHAPTER 11

altogether. The disadvantage of avoiding integration is
that the separate viral DNA is soon lost from host tissues, and the therapy requires frequent repetition. In
lentivectors, molecular modification avoids activation
of proto-oncogenes.
■

■

Altering tissue specificity. The tropism, or tissue
specificity, can be altered by replacing the gene for
the viral envelope glycoprotein (spike protein) with
the envelope gene from a different virus. For example,
a rabies virus glycoprotein can be used to target the
vector to brain cells. The alteration of viral tissue
specificity by envelope gene replacement is called
“pseudotyping.” Pseudotyping can be used either to
narrow the host range or to broaden it, depending on
the needs of the vector.
Avoiding germ-line infection. Current medical standards prohibit alteration of the germ line, the egg and
sperm cells that transmit genes to the next generation. Because the long-term risks of gene therapy are
unknown, only somatic gene therapy (gene insertion
into somatic, or body, cells) is permitted.

RNA viruses and encode a wider range of viral enzymes;
for example, the vaccinia genome encodes nearly 200 different proteins. The complexity of viruses such as vaccinia
and herpes approaches that of small cells.
Herpes viruses have been associated with humans and
our ape ancestors for hundreds of millions of years (see
Chapter 6). Different herpes viruses cause diseases ranging from chickenpox (varicella-zoster virus) to birth defects
(cytomegalovirus). Today, in a remarkable twist, we have
engineered a “tumor-eating herpes” to treat metastatic
tumors (discussed shortly).
Herpes viral DNA replicates by mechanisms similar to those
used in the replication of prokaryotic and phage genomes,
either bidirectionally from an origin of replication (as in bacteria) or by the rolling-circle method (as in phages such as T4).
Like cellular genomes, herpes viral DNA replication requires
more than a polymerase; enzymes such as helicase, primase,
and single-strand binding proteins are also needed.

Herpes Simplex Virus Infects
the Oral or Genital Mucosa

An important example of a DNA virus is herpes simplex
virus (HSV). Strains HSV-1 and HSV-2 cause one of the
most common infections in the United States. Approximately 60% of Americans acquire herpes simplex, usually
HSV-1, in epithelial lesions commonly known as cold sores.
About 30%–60% acquire genital herpes, usually HSV-2,
through sexual contact (oral or vaginal). Genital herpes

causes recurrent eruptions of infection in the reproductive
tract (Fig. 11.32). Many of those infected are unaware of
symptoms, but they can still transmit the disease to others.
Herpes simplex virus typically infects cells of the oral
or genital mucosa, causing ulcerated sores. The primary
infection is epithelial, followed by latent infection within
neurons of the ganglia. A common site of infection is
the trigeminal ganglion, which processes nerve impulses
between the face and eyes and the brain stem.
The latent infection of the ganglia later leads to new
outbreaks of virus, often triggered by stress such as menstruation, sunlight exposure, or depression of the immune
system. Progeny virions travel back down the dendrites to
the epithelia, causing lytic infection. In the trigeminal ganglion, herpes reactivation can lead to eye disease or lethal
brain infection. In most cases, herpes symptoms can be
controlled by antiviral agents such as acyclovir (discussed
in Chapter 27). No cure or means of preventing future outbreaks exists. In pregnant women, HSV can be transmitted
to the fetus, with serious complications for the child.
Herpes simplex virus is closely related to varicella-zoster virus, the cause of chickenpox, also an epithelial infection. Varicella, too, can hide in ganglial neurons, emerging
decades later to cause painful skin lesions called shingles.

packaged within an icosahedral capsid. The capsid is surrounded by tegument, a collection of virus-encoded and host-derived proteins. The
tegument is contained within a host-derived membrane envelope, including several kinds of envelope proteins. B. The genome of HSV-1 spans
152,000 base pairs, encoding more than 70 gene products. The HSV sequence consists of two segments: long (UL) and short (US). Each segment contains a unique region (UL or US) flanked by two inverted-repeat regions—terminal (TRL or TRS) and internal (IRL or IRS)—where the
two segments meet.

(Fig. 11.33A ). The capsid is surrounded by tegument,
a collection of about 15 different kinds of virus-encoded
proteins, as well as proteins from the previous host. The
tegument is contained within a host-derived membrane
envelope with several kinds of spike proteins. The HSV-1
genome spans 152 kb, encoding more than 70 gene products (Fig. 11.33B). The sequence includes two unique
segments, long (U L) and short (US), each flanked by a terminal repeat (TR L or TR S) and an internal repeat (IR L
or IR S). Within the host, the genome circularizes, so the
genetic linkage map appears circular.
Herpes genes and gene regulatory elements resemble those of eukaryotic genes. Each gene has a promoter
with eukaryotic control sequences such as the TATA box.
Genes are transcribed and translated individually; there is
no polyprotein. Genes fall into temporal classes within the
viral replication cycle: immediate, early, and late expressed
genes. Each class has specific regulatory elements. Thus,
the virus expresses only the gene products needed for a
given phase of infection. An additional class, consisting of the LAT genes, is expressed for latent infection
(discussed next).

Herpes Simplex Attachment
and Host Cell Entry
Unlike HIV, the relatively large herpes virion has several
envelope proteins that can bind to several alternative receptor molecules on the host cell surface, such as a homolog
of tumor necrosis factor receptor called HveA or intercellular adhesion molecules called nectins (Fig. 11.34 , step
1). As in the case of HIV, the entire herpes capsid enters
the cytoplasm (step 2); but unlike HIV, whose core particle
partly uncoats, the intact herpes capsid travels down a scaffold of microtubules (step 3) to the nuclear membrane. During this stage, the virion host shutoff factor (Vhs) degrades
host mRNA, thus shutting off host protein synthesis. At
a nuclear pore complex, the herpes capsid injects its DNA
(step 4). The DNA is forced out of the capsid and into the
nucleus by the high pressure of double-stranded DNA packing in the capsid, similar to the high-pressure injection of
phage T4 DNA into a bacterial cell. The DNA then circularizes (step 5) to form a plasmid-like intermediate.
The herpes genome now takes one of two alternative directions: expression of mRNA for proteins of the infection cycle,

or expression of mRNA encoding LAT proteins to maintain latency (Fig. 11.34, step 6). If the latent course is taken,
the DNA circle can persist within the cell for decades before
switching to lytic infection. Latent infection is seen most
often in nerve cells, such as those of the trigeminal ganglion.

Replication of Herpes Simplex Virus

In the nucleus, herpes DNA is transcribed to mRNA by host
RNA polymerase II (see Fig. 11.34, step 5). If mRNA for
lytic infection is produced, it exits the nucleus to be translated by ribosomes. Many different mRNAs are produced
and exported, including those required for “immediate” and
“early” stages of infection (Fig. 11.34, step 7). The translated
proteins return to the nucleus for packaging within capsids.
To generate progeny genomes, the circular DNA is replicated by viral enzymes, including DNA polymerase, singlestrand binding protein, and a proofreading endonuclease
(Fig. 11.34, step 8). Additional enzymes are provided
by the host cell. DNA is replicated by the rolling-circle
method, generating a concatemer similar to that of phage
T4. Unlike T4, however, the herpes DNA is eventually cut
into segments defined by the terminal repeat sequences.
The newly synthesized DNA expresses late-stage mRNA
(Fig. 11.34, step 9), which exits the nucleus for translation.
Translated envelope proteins are inserted into the ER membrane, through which they migrate to the nuclear membrane
(step 10). Other late proteins reenter the nucleus for assembly into capsids containing DNA genomes (step 11). The
envelope forms from the outer nuclear membrane (step 12).
The virions are then transported through the ER, where
they undergo secondary envelopment (step 13). The secondary-enveloped virions move to the Golgi, and ultimately to
the cell membrane (step 14). The secondary envelope fuses
with the cell membrane, releasing mature virions through
exocytosis (step 14). Rapid release of virions destroys cells,
causing the characteristic sores of herpes infection.

Herpes viruses can infect humans and other animals indefinitely, following initiation of latency by the viral LAT proteins (see Fig. 11.34, step 6). Most humans are infected by
several latent herpes viruses, such as human herpes viruses
6 and 7, Epstein-Barr virus, and cytomegalovirus (see Special Topic 11.1). We may be infected all our lives without
knowing it; in fact, our bodies may actually benefit from
the presence of these viruses. For example, in 2007, Herbert Virgin and colleagues at the Washington University

School of Medicine in St. Louis showed that mice infected
with a gamma herpes virus similar to Epstein-Barr virus
resist infection by the bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes (the cause of listeriosis) and Yersinia pestis (the
cause of bubonic plague). The mechanism of antibacterial
resistance may involve stimulation of the immune response.
Thus, some of our silent herpes viral “partners” may have
coevolved with humans in a mutually beneficial relationship, or mutualism (discussed in Chapter 21).
The maintenance of persistent or latent viral infection
involves several kinds of processes that are surprisingly similar in DNA viruses such as herpes and in retroviruses such
as HIV. These processes include:
■

Infection of cell types suitable for long-term persistence. After infecting skin cells for rapid viral replication, some HSV virions infect neurons. Neurons are
long-lived cells that provide the virus with an everlasting
home in the host. Similarly, Epstein-Barr virus persists
within long-lived memory-B-cell lymphocytes.

■

Regulation of viral gene expression. The LAT proteins suppress expression of viral genes for lytic replication, thus preventing host cell destruction where the
latent viral DNA resides. Suppression is the result of
assembly of “heterochromatin,” chromosome-associated
host proteins that inactivate all viral genes except those
encoding LAT proteins.

■

Viral subversion of cellular apoptosis. To maintain
latent infection, a viral DNA must prevent host cell apoptosis, a form of programmed self-destruction in response
to viral infection. For example, cytomegalovirus prevents
apoptosis by mimicking one host apoptosis protein and
inhibiting another. Similarly, the HIV retroviral accessory protein Tat prevents apoptosis by inhibiting protein
p53, which suppresses tumors through apoptosis.

■

Evasion of immune responses. Both herpes viruses
and retroviruses express proteins that inhibit signaling
molecules of the immune system, or that mimic immunosuppressive signals.

Herpes Viruses Engineered
to Kill Tumors

The long-standing adaptation of herpes viruses to the human
body confers properties useful for virotherapy. Some kinds
of viruses have a preference for infection of tumor cells. Such
a virus is called “oncolytic.” Oncolytic viruses are being
developed to treat cancer. An example of an oncolytic virus
for tumor therapy is the engineered form of HSV-1 virus
called T-VEC, developed by a company acquired by Amgen.
In 2015, the United States approved the use of T-VEC to
treat melanoma in patients with inoperable tumors.

defects or developmental problems later. Birth defects may
include microcephaly, neurological problems, and loss of
hearing or vision.
How does CMV infection cause birth defects? Lee Fortunato

We often think of herpes viruses as something to avoid
“catching,” like chickenpox or herpes simplex. But some members of this ancient and diverse virus family are hard to avoid.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infects between 50% and 80% of us
before age 40. The virus is transmitted by person-to-person
contact, usually causing no symptoms. But CMV may start
to replicate in immunocompromised people—for example,
after an organ transplant. And during pregnancy, new CMV
exposure or reactivation of a latent infection can expose the

embryonic neural progenitor cells (NPCs, left) grow as clumps of round neurospheres. NPCs infected with virus (right) form long
projections and commence migration—a sign of premature differentiation.
■

T-VEC infects tumor cells and replicates, but it cannot
replicate within normal cells. When T-VEC infects tumor
cells, it also releases tumor cell fragments that attract cells
of the immune system to recognize the tumors for destruction. Because T-VEC activates the immune system, it helps
destroy tumors throughout the body. This antitumor effect
of a virus is particularly promising for metastatic tumors
that are hard to treat by other means.

■

■

■

To Summarize
■

■

Herpes simplex virus causes recurring eruptions of
sores in the oral or genital mucosa. Initial transmission
is by oral or genital contact, followed by eruptions from
reactivated virus latent in ganglial neurons.
The herpes virion contains a double-stranded DNA
genome, packed in an icosahedral capsid. The capsid is surrounded by numerous matrix proteins and by an envelope.

■

■

■

HSV attachment may involve several alternative receptors. A microtubular scaffold transports the herpes virions to the nucleus, where the DNA genome is inserted.
The DNA circularizes for transcription.
LAT protein expression leads to latent infection, usually in nerve cells, where the DNA persists silently for
months or years.
DNA genomes of HSV are synthesized by the rollingcircle method, using viral DNA polymerase supplemented by viral and host-generated components.
Infectious mRNA expression leads to production of
capsid, matrix, and envelope proteins for assembly of HSV.
HSV assembly takes place at the nuclear membrane or
other membranes. The virions are released from the cell
by exocytosis. Rapid release leads to mucosal pathology.
HSV can be engineered to specifically kill tumors.

CHAPTER 11

on human neural progenitor cells (NPCs), the cells that develop
into neurons. Neural progenitor cells were obtained from the
brain of a premature infant that died of natural causes. When
cultured in a dish, the neural cells grow as round cells in a clump,
remaining in position. The cells can be induced to differentiate
(become more advanced neural cells). But what happens when
the cells are infected by CMV? Fortunato found that infected
NPCs begin to differentiate prematurely, at the wrong stage
of development, thus causing a defect. In Figure 1B, the CMVinfected cells (right-hand photo) are differentiating, extending
their cytoplasm, and starting to move. Thus, Fortunato shows
how cytomegalovirus could alter the differentiation of embryonic cells during neonatal development.
To uncover the details of CMV infection, we need an
immortalized cell line in which the virus replicates its genome
indefinitely. Fortunato developed such a line, using T98G
glioblastoma cells (Fig. 2). Glioblastoma is a cancer of the
glia, accessory cells to neurons. The cancer cells have lost
their growth inhibition and replicate continually in tissue culture. Figure 2 shows infected cells with the nuclei stained
blue (Hoechst stain) and the CMV viral genomes stained
pink (FISH, fluorescent DNA probe). We hope that improved
understanding of this viral process can yield insights that will
help prevent future birth defects.

RESEARCH QUESTION
How could you use the glioblastoma cell line to determine which
viral proteins initiate or prevent the CMV replication cycle?

Concluding Thoughts
In considering the mechanisms of viral infection, a picture
emerges of interesting commonalities, as well as intriguing
diversity:
■

Viral infection requires host membrane receptors.
Different viruses evolve to take advantage of different
cell membrane proteins in order to recognize and gain
entry into host cells. Mutation of host receptors confers
resistance to the virus.

■

Viruses recruit host cells to replicate their genomes.
Viral genomes are remarkably diverse, including RNA or
DNA, single- or double-stranded, linear or circular. Within
the host cell, replication proceeds by a variety of methods,
with varying dependence on viral and host enzymes.

■

Virus particles (and their genomes) range in size
from a few components to assemblages approaching

the minimal requirement for resources. The advantage
of complexity is the fi ne-tuning of infection mechanisms
for evading host defenses.
The study of viral molecular biology raises intriguing questions about the nature of viral replication and
about viral origins (see eTopic 6.1). Research in virology
offers hope for new drugs and cures for humanity’s worst
plagues, as well as devastating diseases of agricultural
plants and animals. At the same time, it is sobering to note
that despite the enormous volumes we now know about
viruses such as HIV and influenza, the AIDS pandemic
continues to grow, and we face the likely emergence of a
new deadly flu strain. Molecular research can succeed only
in partnership with epidemiology and public health (discussed in Chapter 28).

We can now ask previously unanswerable questions about ribosome function. For example, we assumed that
the two ribosomal subunits had to

is inaccurate. We can also use Ribo-T
to create the first ever fully independent ribosome mRNA

Transposons Inactivate
and Mark Target Genes

How were E. coli acid survival genes found and their function discovered? An early step taken to gain insight into
E. coli acid resistance involved isolating mutants defective
in that process. The initial goal was to inactivate relevant
genes and tag them with an antibiotic resistance marker. To
do this, a transposon (see Section 9.5) containing a tetracycline resistance gene was randomly inserted into the chromosome by transposition. When a transposon inserts into a
target gene sequence, the target gene is inactivated and the
mutant cell becomes antibiotic resistant. In our example,
each tetracycline-resistant cell resulting from transposition
grew into a colony; the colony was picked with a sterile
toothpick and transferred into a well of a microtiter plate
containing growth medium (Fig. 12.2A).
After about 10,000 colonies were transferred to microtiter dishes and grown, a multipronged replicator device
(a square with 48 metal prongs arranged in six rows of eight)
was used to transfer small amounts of each culture to new

microtiter plate wells that contained a pH 2 medium. After
several hours of incubation, the multipronged replicator was
again used to sterilely transfer samples of the pH 2 culture
from each well to an agar plate. A few of the tetracyclineresistant mutants failed to grow on the agar, meaning they
had been killed by the pH 2 environment. The transposon in these acid-sensitive mutants had inserted into a gene
required for acid resistance, rendering it inactive. The acidsensitive mutants were retrieved from the original growth
medium microtiter plates and subjected to further analysis.

Thought Questions

12.1 How would you modify the technique illustrated in

Figure 12.2A to identify mutants defective in the synthesis
of an amino acid, such as glutamic acid? Hint: You can use a
minimal agar medium.

a strategy to construct a strain of E. coli that cannot synthesize histidine?

DNA Sequencing of Insertion
Sites and Computer Analysis

Once mutants in a project are identified, it is important to
know which genes the insertions occurred in. In our example, an oligonucleotide primer (a short, single-stranded
DNA molecule) that anneals to one end of the transposon
was used to sequence across the insertion joint and into the
adjacent E. coli DNA (Fig. 12.2B). The DNA sequences
obtained were subjected to computer-based homology
searches with the sequenced genome of E. coli. The resulting matches indicated that insertions had occurred in four
genes. Two of these genes encode isoforms of glutamate
decarboxylase (GadA and GadB) that differ by only a few
amino acids. A third gene produces a glutamate/GABA
antiporter (GadC), and a fourth gene encodes a putative
DNA-binding protein with no known function, although it
was annotated as a possible regulator.
The nature of the genes’ functions suggests how the
system might protect cells submerged in acid (Fig. 12.3).
When E. coli is placed in a pH 2 environment, the cytoplasmic pH falls to dangerously low levels. Glutamate decarboxylase removes a carboxyl group from glutamate and replaces

gene target of a transposon insertion. A primer that anneals to a

annealing temperature, bind random sequences around the chromosome (including downstream of the transposon) are used to amplify
the junction between the transposon and the gene into which it
has inserted. Subsequent sequencing of the product using only the
transposon primer identifies the gene and the insertion point.

FIGURE 12.3

Model of acid resistance in E. coli. DNA
sequence data identified the location of the transposon insertions leading to acid sensitivity. The genes identified included two
isoforms of glutamate decarboxylase and a putative antiporter that
brings glutamate into the cell in exchange for the decarboxylation
product gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is transported out
of the cell. The combined action of the decarboxylase and antiporter
removes H+ from the cell.

it with a proton from the cytoplasm, thereby decreasing
acidity and elevating cytoplasmic pH. The decarboxylation product of the reaction is gamma-aminobutyric acid
(γ-aminobutyric acid), also known as GABA. But to continue draining protons from the cytoplasm, E. coli must
bring in more glutamate. The glutamate/GABA antiporter
does this by importing glutamate while expelling GABA.
Alternative strategies have also been used to identify
genes potentially related to acid resistance. Microarrays and
RNA deep sequencing techniques have been used to identify all cellular transcripts regulated by growth of E. coli
under milder acid environments. Bioinformatic strategies
outlined in Chapter 8 were then used to hypothesize function of the products (regulator, transporter, and so on).
Some of the acid pH-regulated genes were then selectively
deleted using in vivo molecular tools that precisely delete
the gene of interest, replacing it with an antibiotic drug
marker. Once these genes were deleted, researchers could
determine the effects of the missing gene on acid resistance
or on the expression of other acid-regulated genes.

Exploring Gene Regulation:
Transcriptomics versus
Reporter Fusions

Another important question in our research example was
whether acid resistance genes are regulated in response to
changes in the environment. Are they always expressed, making the cell ever-ready to encounter acid stress? Or does the
cell sense when it might encounter life-threatening low pH
and only then express acid resistance genes? Recall that the
cell can control production of a protein by regulating transcription and/or translation, or by altering mRNA or protein stability (processes described in Chapters 8 and 10). How
do microbiologists differentiate among these possibilities or
determine whether there is any regulation in the first place?
As will be described in Section 12.2, quantitative (realtime) PCR can be used to measure changes in the amount of
a specific RNA transcript when cells are subjected to environmental or genetic perturbations. RNA deep sequencing (RNAseq), described in Section 10.6, can measure the
levels of all transcripts in a cell. However, those techniques
have drawbacks if you want to continually monitor gene
expression in a live cell or if you want to screen for regulatory genes that control the expression of the target gene.
One technique that allows continuous monitoring of a
gene’s expression involves linking (or fusing) the promoter of
the gene of interest to what is called a promoter-less reporter
gene, such as lacZ (which encodes beta-galactosidase) or gfp
(GFP, green fluorescent protein; see Chapter 2). Reporter
genes encode proteins whose activities are easily assayed. In
the case of lacZ, beta-galactosidase (β-galactosidase) converts the substrate o-nitrophenyl galactoside (ONPG) to a

GENES AND GENOMES

Because there is only one promoter, only one mRNA transcript is made. The 5′ end of the newly engineered polycistronic mRNA will contain the target gene transcript
followed at the 3′ end by the reporter gene transcript. Now,
any factor that controls expression of the target gene’s promoter will also control production of the reporter. Because
the reporter retains its own ribosome-binding site, it will
not respond to translational controls over the target transcript. The fusion just described is known as a transcriptional fusion, which can monitor transcriptional control
of the target gene.
Another type of reporter lacks both its promoter and its
RBS. This reporter produces gene fusions (also known as
protein fusions or translational fusions). For the reporter
protein to be synthesized, the reporter gene sequence must
be joined to the target gene sequence in the proper codon
reading frame (Fig. 12.4C). Now, not only will the mRNA
transcripts of the target and reporter genes be fused, but
the peptides of the truncated target gene and the reporter
gene will also be linked. In this case, anything controlling
the transcription or translation of the target gene will also
control reporter protein levels.
Each type of fusion can be constructed in vitro using
plasmids and then transferred into recipient cells in a way
that promotes the exchange of the reporter fusion for the
resident gene. Once constructed, these fusions allow the
researcher to monitor how different growth conditions,
or whether suspected regulators, influence the transcription or translation of the gene. These fusions provide convenient phenotypes (for example, lactose fermentation or
fluorescence) that can be exploited in mutant hunts to
screen for new regulators. eAppendix 3 describes how lacZ
fusions can be used to find regulatory genes.

dips. Now imagine looking down at a neighborhood of
houses. You see that the heater in one house turns on as
another house’s heater turns off. The result appears to be a
stochastic (random) process of heaters being turned on and
off, but the population as a whole stays warm.
Do bacterial cells respond to stress in the same way? What
technique could even address this question in single cells?
LacZ fusions are inadequate because LacZ enzyme activity is
measured as an average of all cells in the population. However, green fluorescent protein (GFP), or a derivative such as
yellow fluorescent protein (YFP), fused to a gene does allow
scientists to view (in real time) what happens inside single
cells within a population. Realizing this, Michael Elowitz
and colleagues from the California Institute of Technology
used a YFP fusion to elegantly reveal stochastic gene expression in Bacillus subtilis subjected to energy stress.
Elowitz and co-workers placed the promoter and
ribosome-binding site of the gene encoding sigma B, a
major stress sigma factor from B. subtilis, in front of yfp.
Cells in which sigma B was expressed would fluoresce
green. A sigma B–YFP cell was then treated with mycophenolic acid to induce energy stress. What happened
next was observed using quantitative time-lapse microscopy. Surprisingly, the constant energy stress imposed on
the population triggered unsynchronized pulses of sigma
B activation in individual cells (Fig. 12.5). As the stress
increased, the pulses became more frequent. Thus, sigma B
controls its target genes through sustained on/off pulsing
(like the neighborhood house heaters) rather than by continuous activation.
As this example illustrates, GFP fusions are more versatile than LacZ fusions in many ways. GFP fusions can be

You find a 50-fold increase in expression of gadA (based on

is transcriptional or translational?

Targeted Gene Editing and Regulation
with CRISPR-Cas9 Technology

Chapter 9 described a form of bacterial and archaeal
“immune system” called CRISPR (clustered regularly
interspaced short palindromic repeats). Recall that when a
bacterial cell survives a viral attack, a short DNA sequence
from the virus is captured and inserted into the CRISPR
locus as a kind of memory of the attack (see Fig. 9.13).
The CRISPR locus includes sequences captured from
many viruses, forming a kind of rogues’ gallery of viral
suspects. The virus-derived sequences are separated from
each other by short (32 bp) palindromic repeat sequences.

■

BIOTECHNIQUES AND SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY

449

Once captured, transcripts of the virus memory sequences
are periodically incorporated into a “search and destroy”
endonuclease called Cas (Fig. 9.13). If the same virus reinvades the cell at a later date, the CRISPR transcript (called
csRNA) guides Cas to the target viral DNA sequence and
cleaves it, thereby destroying the virus. This is how the system works in nature. One CRISPR-Cas system has now
been repurposed into a powerful molecular tool that can
genetically edit any gene in a eukaryotic cell. The technology has enabled precision gene editing in species where this
has never been possible.
The CRISPR-Cas9 editing tool. The system most often used
is the CRISPR-Cas9 from Streptococcus pyogenes. The key to
this tool is in programming a synthetic csRNA (now called
a guide RNA, or gRNA) to direct Cas9 endonuclease to a
specific eukaryotic gene. The programmed gRNA is fused to
what is called the tracer RNA, a molecule that binds to and

into eukaryotic cells? The gene that encodes Cas9 and the

then introduces a double-strand break in the target DNA—a
critical feature of this gene-editing tool. To survive, the
eukaryotic cell will try to re-join the blunt ends using nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair (Fig. 12.6A; described
in Section 9.4). However, the process often deletes a few
bases, which may cripple the gene. Once mutated, the effect
of the altered gene on cell physiology can be assessed.
The targeted gene can also be changed or replaced using
CRISPR-Cas9 technology. In this case, a third plasmid is
introduced that expresses a modified version (or allele) of
the gene. Both ends of the replacement gene are homologous to DNA flanking the target gene, so homologous
recombination systems will replace the broken gene with
the modified allele. Any type of insertion, deletion, or
change in sequence can be introduced.
A striking example of this technology’s potential was
demonstrated when it was used to disrupt latent HIV provirus in infected cells. As described in Chapter 11, HIV
DNA made by reverse transcriptase integrates into the host
genome. Current drug therapies can stop HIV replication
and transmission, but will not expunge the provirus from
infected cells. Scientists from Kyoto University led by Hirotaka Ebina used the CRISPR-Cas9 system to disrupt HIV
provirus, offering hope that this system may provide a tool
for curing HIV infection.

The CRISPR-Cas9 system has also been modified to serve
as a regulator of gene expression. CRISPR interference
(CRISPRi), for example, uses an inactive version of Cas9
(dCas9) that no longer works as an endonuclease but can
still be guided to target DNA sequences. Once bound to its
target, dCas9 blocks transcription. Timothy Lu’s laboratory
at MIT recently used CRISPRi to control gene expression
in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron growing in a mouse intestine. B. thetaiotaomicron is an important bacterial member
of mammalian gut microbiomes (discussed in Sections 13.4
and 23.1). The scientists designed an sgRNA (single guide
RNA) to target a luciferase gene that was part of the organism’s genome. The sgRNA and the gene for dCas9 were
also integrated into the microbe’s genome (Fig. 12.6B).
The gene for dCas9 also included the lacO operator, which
means that dCas9 can be induced by the addition of IPTG.
Without IPTG, the circuit allows luciferase to be made,
and cells glow. Adding IPTG, however, induces dCas9 production. The sgRNA guides dCas9 to the luciferase gene
to turn it off. The authors demonstrated that the system
worked when the programmed organism resided in the
mouse intestine and IPTG was added to drinking water.
The ability to precisely modulate gene expression in commensal organisms should enable functional studies of the
microbiome, noninvasive monitoring of in vivo environments, and long-term targeted therapeutics.

Transposons can be used to mutate genes and mark the
defective gene with antibiotic resistance.
The location of a transposon insertion can be determined by sequencing from the end of the transposon
across the insertion junction. The junction sequence
is examined by online comparative BLAST analysis to
identify the gene in the genome.
Annotations of the gene may provide clues about the
function of the protein.
Regulation of a gene can be determined by fusing that
gene to an easily assayed reporter gene.
Transcriptional fusions to reporter genes reflect transcriptional control of the subject gene.
Translational fusions to reporter genes (gene fusions)
reflect transcriptional and translational control of the
subject gene.
The CRISPR-Cas9 microbial “immune system” has
been adapted as a tool to quickly and efficiently edit
eukaryotic genes.

Molecular Techniques

In many cases, making gene fusions is not possible. For
instance, some fusion proteins can aggregate and block
membranes. In these situations, deep sequencing and mass
spectrometry techniques can be used for whole-cell transcriptomic and proteomic purposes, respectively (see Chapter 10).
But sometimes, examining only a specific gene or protein is
desired. Classic molecular techniques can then be used, such
as the northern blot (for RNA), the Southern blot (for DNA),
and the western blot (for protein). All rely on electrophoresis
to separate relevant macromolecules (see Section 3.2). Details
of the northern and Southern blot techniques are found in
eAppendix 3. Here we briefly review the techniques and
show how they helped reveal details of E. coli acid resistance.

Northern and Southern Blots

Northern blots are used to analyze the presence, size, and
processing of a specific RNA molecule in a cell extract. In the
northern blot technique, RNA is extracted from the cell, and
individual molecules are separated by size, using electrophoresis through an agarose-formaldehyde gel (see eAppendix 3).
The separated fragments are transferred by simple capillary
action onto a nylon or nitrocellulose membrane, forming the
blot. After the RNA has been transferred, the membrane is

blots can be used to monitor the quantity and breakdown of RNA.
The blot shown illustrates that gadB and gadC are transcribed as
an operon (note the size markers on the left). The gadA gene is
located elsewhere in the genome and is transcribed separately. The
data also illustrate that gadA and gadBC mRNAs accumulate after
growth at pH 5.5. The accumulation is due to increased transcription. A second blot using a gadC probe was used to show that the
larger transcript also contains gadC (not shown). Source: Modified from

hybridized (or “probed”) with a small, labeled DNA fragment (usually made via PCR) that will anneal to a specific
mRNA species on the blot. A similar probing strategy, called
the Southern blot technique, is used to detect the presence
of specific DNA bands (genes) among electrophoretically
separated DNA fragments (see eAppendix 3).
In our acid resistance example, northern blots were used
to ask whether the E. coli acid resistance genes are regulated. The northern blot in Figure 12.7 reveals that when
cells are grown under acidic conditions (low pH), the gadA
gene and the operon gadBC are both induced. The DNA
probe used can bind to either the gadA or gadB mRNA.
Because gadB and gadC form an operon, a longer mRNA
molecule appears on the blot. The RNA bands are also
more intense in the lane from acid-grown cultures (pH 5.5)
than in the lane from cultures grown at high pH (pH 7.7),
suggesting that the transcription of these genes is induced
by acid. An alternative procedure for quantifying levels (but
not sizes) of specific RNA molecules is quantitative (realtime) PCR, which is discussed later in this section.

Western Blots

Another way to examine gene regulation is to detect the
protein products themselves using a technique called the
western blot. The western blot is frequently used in today’s
laboratories. To begin with, the protein extract is subjected
to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
(see Section 10.6 and eAppendix 3). The protein bands are
electrophoretically transferred from the gel to a membrane
made of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) (Fig. 12.8A).

protein bands to which the primary antibody has bound
will be detected. The technique is used to determine
whether, and at what levels, specific proteins are present in
a cell extract; it can also reveal whether a protein has been
cleaved (processed) from a larger to a smaller form.
In the acid resistance example (Fig. 12.8B), western
blot analysis was performed to detect glutamate decarboxylase protein. The blot shows that the level of this protein is
induced by growth under acidic conditions. Thus, the acidinduced increase in mRNA from transcription (as shown by
northern blot) correlates with an increase in translated protein (as shown by western blot).
Thought Question

12.5 What would you conclude if the northern blot of the gad
genes showed no difference in mRNA levels in cells grown at
pH 5.5 and pH 7.7, but the western blot showed more protein
at pH 5.5 than at pH 7.7?

DNA Mobility Shifts

Once a gene encoding a putative transcriptional regulatory
protein has been identified by sequence annotation, proof of
function requires a demonstration that the protein will bind
to a DNA sequence present in the target promoter area.
One approach is to add purified protein to the putative target DNA fragment and then see whether the protein causes
a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of that fragment in
a gel. An example of this method, as applied to our acid
resistance problem, is illustrated in Figure 12.9A. Linear
DNA molecules travel in agarose or polyacrylamide gels at
an inverse rate relative to their size; that is, larger molecules

■

travel more slowly than smaller ones. If a protein binds to a
DNA molecule, the complex is larger than the DNA alone
and will travel even more slowly in the gel. This method of
analyzing protein-DNA binding is called the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) (see Section 10.1).
In our research example, one of the genes that affected
acid resistance (yhiE) was annotated in databases as a
potential transcriptional regulator. The encoded protein
was purified and tested by EMSA for its ability to bind to
the promoter regions of the two potential targets, gadA
and gadBC. As shown in Figure 12.9B, the purified YhiE
protein, renamed GadE because of its role in regulating
glutamic acid decarboxylase expression, did bind the gadA
sequence and retard its mobility. Thus, GadE is a true regulator of the acid resistance genes.

Purifying Proteins by Affinity Tag

How do researchers purify proteins? Today, a protein with
a known sequence can be purified in about a week. The
trick is to fuse the gene encoding the protein to a DNA
sequence encoding a peptide tag that strongly binds a particular small ligand molecule. The target ligand is attached
to beads, and the cell extract containing the tagged protein
is passed over the beads. The tagged protein binds to the
beads, while other proteins do not. This technique, called
affinity chromatography, allows researchers to essentially
“fish” the tagged protein from a complex mixture of proteins present in a cell extract.
There are several commonly used peptide tags. One tag
is a series of six histidines, called a His6 tag, which tightly
binds to nickel. A commercially available plasmid that
is used to make His-tagged proteins includes an inducible promoter constructed by linking the promoter from
T5 phage to two copies of lacO (Fig. 12.10A ). Adding

the lactose analog IPTG will induce transcription (see
Chapter 10) and control when the fusion protein is produced. To make the fusion, the vector (the DNA carrier
molecule) sequentially contains a ribosome-binding site
(RBS), a start ATG codon, a sequence encoding six histidine residues, and a multicloning site (MCS) to insert the
desired open reading frame (ORF). The translational reading frame of the His codons and the codons of the ORF
must be the same to yield a protein fusion.
To purify the resulting protein, nickel-coated beads are
loaded into a column, and then a crude extract containing
the tagged protein is added to the top (Fig. 12.10B). Proteins that do not bind to the nickel (that is, those without
the His6 tag) are eluted with buffer. The tagged protein
molecules that did bind are then eluted from the column
with an elution buffer containing imidazole. Imidazole has
a stronger affinity for the nickel, so it displaces the His6 tagged protein from the beads. Analysis of the progressive purification of GadB by the His6 tag fusion method is
shown in Figure 12.10C.

Mapping Transcriptional Start Sites

Recall from Section 8.1 that promoters have consensus sequences located at –10 and –35 bp from the transcription start site. To begin searching for upstream
promoter sequences, we need to define where each
transcript begins. One method to determine transcript
length is called primer extension (details are provided in
eAppendix 3). In brief, a single DNA primer is designed
to anneal near the 5′ end of an mR NA. Reverse transcriptase, which synthesizes DNA from an R NA template, is then used to extend the primer to the 5′ start of
the message. The result is complementary DNA (cDNA)
of a precise length. When electrophoresed next to a DNA
sequencing ladder of the region (made using the same
primer), the cDNA product aligns with the base corresponding to the transcription start site. eAppendix 3
describes how primer extension was used to identify the
gadA promoter.
Primer extension will identify transcripts for single genes,
but how can transcript start sites for an entire genome be
determined all at once? This is possible using modern deep
sequencing technologies (see Section 10.6). Briefly, wholecell RNA transcripts are extracted from cells and made into
small fragments that are converted to cDNA. The cDNA
is sequenced using next-generation sequencing platforms.
Computer programs then assemble the fragments and align
them with the genomic DNA sequence. An example of this
strategy is shown in Figure 12.11A. The 5′ end of each
assembled, nonoverlapping transcript is presumed to be the
transcriptional start site. So the segment in the figure contains two transcripts—or does it?

RNA molecules can undergo a type of processing in
which a long transcript starting from a bona fide promoter
is cleaved into smaller fragments. So, is transcript B in
Figure 12.11A made from its own promoter, or is it a product made from a larger transcript encompassing A and B?
Recall that the 5′ nucleotide in all primary RNA transcripts is a triphosphate, whereas the first nucleotide of a
cleaved (processed) transcript has to be a monophosphate
(Fig. 12.11B). This distinction led to a novel differential
RNA sequencing (dRNAseq) approach that was developed to discover primary transcriptional start sites on
a genome-wide scale. It uses the 5′-monophosphatedependent terminator exonuclease (TEX) that specifically degrades 5′-monophosphorylated RNA species, such
as processed RNA (including mature rRNA and tRNA).
Any 5′-triphosphorylated RNA species (primary transcripts) remain intact. This approach makes it possible to
identify primary-transcript start sites by comparing TEXtreated transcripts with untreated libraries. The dRNAseq
procedure has been used to identify primary transcripts in
numerous species, including small RNAs (sRNAs) in the
plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris.

DNA Protection Analysis Identifies
DNA-Protein Contacts

Although EMSA identifies DNA fragments bound by a
transcriptional regulatory protein, the technique does not
reveal which nucleotides are bound. There are several techniques that can do this. One method asks which nucleotides
are protected from nuclease digestion when a regulatory
protein binds to a DNA fragment. The protected bases represent what is called the “footprint” of the binding protein.
Identifying specific nucleotide-protein interactions between
transcriptional regulators and their target sites (for instance,
an activator of a pathogenicity operon) provides insight into
how these interactions promote or inhibit transcription.
Because a regulatory protein covers DNA at its bindingsite sequence, an enzyme that might attack the sequence
cannot get close enough to do damage. Deoxyribonuclease
I (DNase I), one of many different types of DNases, is one
such enzyme. It cleaves phosphodiester bonds between bases.
Figure 12.12 presents the DNase I footprinting technique.
In this method, DNase I is added to a DNA fragment at a
concentration that can nick each molecule only once during
the incubation period (Fig. 12.12A). When the DNA is
later denatured by heat, arrays of single-stranded fragments
are produced (Fig. 12.12B). Each fragment is a different
size, depending on where the nick occurred. Because only
one end of one strand of the DNA is labeled (by radiation
or fluorescence), only the fragments containing that label
will be seen following polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
and autoradiography.

Figure 12.12C presents the actual footprint of GadX,
another regulator of E. coli acid resistance. The regulatory
protein GadX covers a region around the promoter of gadA
and gadB (only gadA is shown). The region is immediately
upstream of the promoter. It is thought that both regulatory proteins GadE (previously described) and GadX communicate with RNA polymerase at the promoter, allowing
it to transcribe the acid resistance genes.
DNA protection assays do not definitively show contact
points between protein and DNA. Areas of the protein only
have to be close enough to the DNA to hinder nuclease
access. Protein-DNA interaction sites can be better defined

by other, more difficult methods that cause a cross-link
between amino acids of the protein and the specific bases
they contact in the DNA. Nevertheless, the DNA protection assay remains a useful tool.

Thought Question

12.6 Another regulator of glutamate decarboxylase (Gad)
production does not affect the production of gad mRNA, but
is required to accumulate Gad protein. What two regulatory
mechanisms might account for this phenotype?

Another modification of the PCR technique is called quantitative (real-time) PCR (RT PCR). Real-time PCR uses fluorescence to monitor the progress of PCR as it occurs (that is,
in real time). Data are collected throughout the PCR process
rather than just at the end of the reaction. Quantitative PCR
can be used to quantify the level of DNA or RNA in a sample. DNA is quantified by how long it takes to first detect an
amplified product while the polymerase chain reaction is still
running. The higher the starting copy number of the nucleic
acid target, the sooner a significant increase in fluorescence is
observed. Thus, the time at which fluorescence increases is a
reflection of the amount of nucleic acid in the original sample.
How does quantitative PCR work? Two techniques are
commonly used. In one, a compound called SYBR green is

Visualizing the Interactions
and Movements of Proteins

When a cell encounters a change in its environment, the
impact on the cell radiates along and between pathways
affecting many different genes and proteins. Tracking
these global regulatory influences can show how a species adjusts its physiology to better tolerate, or even flourish in, a new environment. Transcriptomic and proteomic
techniques described in Chapters 7, 8, and 10 reveal the
global changes in mRNA and protein levels that cells
undergo when entering new environments. Here we will
show how to reveal interaction networks between proteins
and genes, and between proteins and proteins. We will
also see how to track protein movements through cells.

Whole-Genome DNA-Binding
Analysis: ChIP-seq

The techniques discussed in Section 12.2 are great for identifying a protein-DNA binding site where you already suspect
that the protein binds. But is there a way to blindly determine
all the sites in a genome to which a given protein binds? There
is, and the basic process, called ChIP sequencing (ChIP-seq)
is outlined in Figure 12.15. In the cell, the DNA-binding
protein of interest (a transcription factor, TF) binds to all of
its DNA target sites in the genome. The cells are treated with
formaldehyde to covalently cross-link proteins to DNA. The
DNA and its bound proteins are isolated and sheared into
small fragments. Next, the transcription factor–DNA complexes are “fished” from the extract using tiny beads with

antibodies attached that bind only to that particular TF protein. The beads are pelleted by centrifugation, which “pulls
down” antibody bound to the TF protein–DNA complexes.
Unbound DNA fragments are washed away. This process is
called chromatin immunoprecipitation, or ChIP.
Next, the protein-DNA cross-links are removed (usually
by heat), and the released DNA fragments are amplified
by PCR. (To amplify the unknown fragments, the fragments are ligated at both ends to linker oligonucleotides
that can be amplified by known primers containing fluorescent dye.) The fluorescently tagged, amplified fragments

Many cellular proteins interact with and influence the
function of other proteins in the cell. For example, antisigma factors help control the timing of sporulation in
Bacillus by interacting with sigma proteins. Many proteins, such as RNA polymerase and the ribosome, function as components of multisubunit complexes. However,
there are other intracellular situations in which protein
complexes can simplify physiological processes. A complex
containing fatty acid biosynthesis enzymes, for instance,
allows intermediates to pass quickly from one subunit to
another without having to diffuse through the cell. Thus,
all the protein-protein interactions of a living cell, which
are collectively referred to as the interactome, are essential to the normal workings of the cell. Unraveling these
interactions is an invaluable way of understanding protein
function. How, then, does one map an interactome?
Yeast two-hybrid analysis. It is important to probe

protein-protein interactions in vivo, where the proteins
actually work. An ingenious tool to measure in vivo protein-protein interaction is the two-hybrid system. Twohybrid analysis can be used to mine for unknown “prey”
proteins that interact with a known “bait” protein.
While there are many types of two-hybrid techniques, a
classic example is the yeast two-hybrid system shown in
Figure 12.16. In yeast two-hybrid analysis, genes encoding two potentially interacting proteins are fused to separated parts of the yeast GAL4 transcription factor, which is
normally one protein (Fig. 12.16A). One gene is fused to
the GAL4 activation domain, while the other gene is fused
to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain. If the two proteins of
interest interact with each other, then the two parts of GAL4
are brought together. The DNA-binding domain binds to the
yeast GAL1 gene promoter region, and the activation domain
(towed behind by the interacting proteins) is positioned to
bind RNA polymerase and stimulate GAL1 transcription.
The target reporter gene is typically a chromosomal
GAL1-lacZ transcriptional fusion, although other reporter
genes can be used. When the two hybrid proteins interact,
the complex activates transcription of GAL1-lacZ, which is
visualized on agar plates containing X-Gal. X-Gal is a colorless substrate of beta-galactosidase that, when cleaved,
produces a blue product.
The power of this technique is that it can also be used
to find unknown proteins that interact with a known protein. A known protein fused to one of the GAL4 domains

can be used as “bait” to find the “prey” proteins expressed
by randomly cloned “prey” genes fused to the other
GAL4 domain. Plasmids containing the bait and prey
fusions are transformed into yeast cells, and the transformants are plated onto a medium containing X-Gal.
Colonies that express beta-galactosidase are the result of
protein-protein interactions between the bait and prey
fusion proteins. Sequencing the DNA insertion can then
identify the gene encoding the prey protein. An example
of two-hybrid analysis is shown in Figure 12.16B.
Another approach to mapping interactomes uses individual
bait proteins to pluck all of a particular protein’s interacting
partners out of the cell. A small-peptide affinity tag added to
one end of the bait protein will allow the bait protein and its
interacting proteins to be purified by affinity chromatography.
The process is described in eTopic 12.1. A graphical representation of part of an interactome is shown in Figure 12.17.

12.8 You suspect that proteins A and C can simultaneously
bind to protein B, and that this interaction then allows A to interact with C in the complex. How could you use two-hybrid analysis to determine whether these three proteins can interact?

Tracking Cells with Light

The use of green fluorescent protein (GFP) to track the
location of plasmids and nucleoids in living bacteria is
described at the start of Chapter 7. GFP technology can
also be used to target how microbial proteins move through
eukaryotic cells. For instance, the potato virus X (or potexvirus) is a positive-strand RNA virus (a positive-strand
RNA is equivalent to mRNA). One viral protein, called
TBGp3, is required for the virus to move between plant
cells. Investigators fused GFP to the TBGp3 protein and
asked where the protein ended up in the plant leaves. They
delivered the genes to plant cells by bombarding leaves with
the fusion plasmids. As shown in Figure 12.18, GFP alone

was diffusely located throughout the leaf. However, the
GFP-TBGp3 fusion protein inserted only into the reticulated network of veins. Altering specific residues within the
protein via mutation prevented this localization, causing
the fusion protein to remain diffused throughout the plant
cells. These results suggest that TBGp3 protein helps guide
the virus through the plant’s reticulated network.
This type of gene fusion technology has been used extensively to trace the movement and final location of numerous proteins delivered into host cells by pathogenic bacteria.
GFP tagging has also been used to track the intermingling
of different bacteria forming a biofilm (eTopic 12.2).

Applied Biotechnology

It is remarkable how many useful products can be imagined
and are being developed using the tools of biotechnology (see
Chapter 16). You may be surprised to learn that plants have
been engineered to produce microbial vaccines, and that vaccines can be delivered not only by injecting a protein, but by
simply injecting DNA or RNA that encodes the antigenic
protein (DNA vaccines are discussed in eTopic 12.3). We even
have technology that uses a genetically engineered virus to
repair a human genetic defect (eTopic 12.4). These are all
remarkable additions to our scientific toolbox and are already
helping to improve human life.

Protecting crops such as corn and cotton
from hungry insects is an age-old problem. Insects such as moths or beetles
can cause widespread damage to a crop
in a short period of time. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, chemical
pesticides were widely used to kill these
pests. While generally effective, chemical pesticides can contaminate soil and
groundwater and can impact human
health. Through bioengineering, we
now have a better, safer way.

Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a close relative of Bacillus
anthracis, sporulates on the surfaces of plants. In addition
to the spore, the sporulating cell makes a separate parasporal body that cradles the spore (Fig. 12.19). The parasporal body contains crystallized proteins that are toxic
to insects feeding on the plant. A single subspecies of B.
thuringiensis can produce multiple insecticidal proteins.
After the insect or insect larva ingests the insecticidal protein crystals, the alkaline environment in the insect midgut dissolves the crystals, and insect proteases inadvertently
activate the proteins. Activated insecticidal proteins insert
into the membrane of the midgut cells and form pores that
lead to a loss of membrane potential, cell lysis, and death
of the insect through starvation. It is also proposed that
death is due to septicemia by enteric bacteria that escape
the damaged midgut (antibiotic treatment reduces death).
Because of its effectiveness, farmers have taken to spreading
B. thuringiensis directly on their crops, where even dead
cells are effective.
B. thuringiensis is considered a highly beneficial pesticide with few downsides. Unlike most insecticides,
B. thuringiensis insecticides do not have a broad spectrum of activity, so they do not kill animals or beneficial insects—including the natural enemies of harmful
insects (predators and parasites) and beneficial pollinators
(such as honeybees). Therefore, B. thuringiensis integrates
well with other natural crop controls. Perhaps the major
advantage is that B. thuringiensis is nontoxic to people,
pets, and wildlife, so it is safe to use on food crops or in

other sensitive sites where chemical pesticides can cause adverse
effects.
Although spreading B. thuringiensis on crops is helpful, an
even more effective means of
delivering the toxin has been
developed. The genes encoding
insecticidal proteins have been
spliced right into the genomes of
agriculturally important plants
such as cotton and corn. The
gene is placed under the control
of a plant promoter, so that the
transgenic plant makes its own
insecticide. As of 2013, over 75%
of the cotton and corn planted
in the United States contains
B. thuringiensis genes. Rigorous scientific studies have shown
that foods from these transgenic
plants are safe.

Thought Question

12.9 Would insect resistance to an insecticidal protein be a

concern when developing a transgenic plant? Why or why not?
How would you design a transgenic plant to limit the possibility of insects developing resistance?

Vaccine Proteins Produced in Plants

Starting with the war against smallpox in the late 1700s,
vaccines have been used to inoculate humans against
many terrible diseases (see Chapters 25 and 26). However, the cost of producing them is enormous, and the
price, of course, is passed on to those who are vaccinated or to governments that conduct vaccination programs. Because the cost is problematic for impoverished
nations, 20% of the world’s infants are not vaccinated
properly, resulting in over 2 million preventable deaths
annually.
One potential solution to this problem was to engineer
plants to express vaccine proteins. The gene encoding a
vaccine protein is inserted into the genome of a plant so
that the plant makes the vaccine protein as part of itself.
The vaccine gene must be placed under the control of a
well-expressed plant promoter (recently, plastid genes have
been used). Transgenic plants expressing bacterial or viral
virulence proteins can be used in two ways: They can be
direct vaccine delivery systems, as through edible fruits
and vegetables (such as potatoes, tomatoes, and corn);

CHAPTER 12

or, as with transgenic tobacco crops, they can be a cheap
way to grow large amounts of the vaccine protein that can
be extracted later and used in more conventional ways.
Producing vaccine in edible fruits was an attractive idea
because the fruit could be grown locally and distributed
to residents of poor countries even without refrigeration.
But practical and ethical problems have, so far, prevented
implementation. The use of engineered plants to mass-produce and purify vaccine proteins, however, especially for
use in animals, is happening. Plants used to make vaccines
are listed in Table 12.2.

GENES AND GENOMES

peptides, antibodies cloned from natural sources, or libraries (collections) of mutant enzymes that one wishes to
study. Phage display enables scientists to screen for peptide
variants with altered properties such as increased affinity
for ligand.
The phage vectors used most often are the filamentous bacteriophages fd and M13 (discussed in eTopic 11.2).
These phages infect E. coli strains containing the F plasmid (the phages attach to the sex pili) and replicate without
killing the host cell. The phage particle consists of a single-stranded DNA molecule encapsulated in a long, cylindrical capsid made up of five proteins. The product of gene
3 (g3p)—present in three to five copies—confers phage
infectivity. Most phage display libraries have been produced
by cloning into gene 3.
Peptides displayed on filamentous phages have been used
to select peptides, including antibodies, with high affinities for receptors or antigens (see Section 24.2). Recombinant phages that display high-affinity binding peptides
are isolated from libraries in a process called biopanning
(Fig. 12.20B). In biopanning, the target ligand—for
example, a human virus attachment protein—is attached
to a plastic plate or other support, and phages displaying
random peptides are added. The phages that do not stick
to the human virus protein are washed away. Those that do
bind are subsequently released by adding free ligand (for
example, human virus protein). This process is analogous
to the way miners would pan rivers for gold. Several rounds
of biopanning are required to obtain high-affinity clones.
Following each round, the selected phages are enriched
by repropagation in E. coli. Phage display was successfully
used to identify high-affinity peptides that bind to attachment proteins of some eukaryotic viruses. These virusbinding peptides effectively block viral infection. More
recently, phage display was used to identify specific singlechain antibodies that bind to a surface protein uniquely
present on cancer cells. The antibody disrupts the function
of this protein and significantly decreases viability of the
cancer cell.
Phage display can also be used for directed evolution
projects that retool enzymes (directed evolution is discussed in Chapter 17). Natural enzymes, because they
were selected by evolution to sustain life, do not necessarily have the stability or catalytic activity that would
make them suitable for more harsh biotechnological
applications. Phage display, with its ability to screen millions of mutants, can quickly find the variant with the
desired trait. An example of how phage display was used
to direct the evolution of a more effective beta-lactamase
enzyme that cleaves penicillin is described in eTopic 12.5.
Other in vitro evolution techniques—DNA shuffling and
site-directed mutagenesis—are described in eTopics 12.6
and 12.7.

Thought Question

12.10 You have just employed phage display technology to
select for a protein that tightly binds and blocks the eukaryotic cell receptor targeted by anthrax toxin. When this receptor
is blocked, the toxin cannot get into the target cell. You suspect that the protein may be a useful treatment for anthrax.
How would you recover the gene following phage display and
then express and purify the protein product?

In addition to what we describe here, microbes have been
genetically engineered for many other applications that we
will discuss in later chapters. These applications include the
bioremediation of organic wastes (Chapter 13) and inorganic wastes (Chapter 14); mine leaching (Chapter 14);
engineering of producer microbes (Chapter 16); and oilspill cleanup, mercury removal, and wastewater treatment
(eTopic 22.2).

Biocontainment: “Who
Let the Bugs Out?”

Since the advent of genetic engineering in the 1970s, scientists and ethicists have struggled with how to prevent
the accidental escape of a genetically engineered microbial
“Frankenstein” from the lab. Physical containment such as
air locks at the entrances of some labs is necessary to prevent the escape of lethal pathogens (see Section 28.6), but
what about genetically modified organisms (GMOs)? The
potential consequences of releasing GMOs into an environment are largely unknown. A GMO designed for laboratory
use but accidentally released into the natural environment
might alter ecological balances through competition or by
sharing modified genes with other organisms in the environment. A highly improbable, but not inconceivable,
concern is that a GMO microbe could evolve to become
pathogenic to plants, animals, or humans. With these
unknowns in mind, might there be a way to efficiently contain these organisms without resorting to extreme physical containment strategies? For instance, could we engineer
the organisms to quickly self-destruct if they escape the
laboratory environment?
Existing biocontainment strategies employ natural auxotrophies that are not easily met in nature, or conditional
suicide switches introduced into the organism’s genome
(described in Section 12.5). But many of these mechanisms can be compromised through metabolic crossfeeding or genetic mutation. However, a promising new
approach involving a bioengineered synthetic auxotrophy
has emerged from the Yale University laboratory of Farren

in laboratories. To recode the bacterium, they replaced all
UAG stop codons with UAA stop codons. They then converted UAG into a sense codon by introducing an orthologous aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase–tRNA pair derived from
the archaean Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. The tRNA
recognizes the UAG codon, and the amino acid binding
pocket of the tRNA synthetase was modified to accept the
unnatural amino acid p-azido-L-phenylalanine (pAzF). The
new tRNA synthetase will charge the UAG tRNA with
pAzF.
Finally, UAG codons were introduced into three essential genes encoding DnaA (initiation of replication), MurG
(peptidoglycan synthesis), and SerS (serine aminoacyl
tRNA synthetase). For this strain to grow, the unnatural
amino acid pAzF must be incorporated by translation into
those three essential proteins. Because pAzF is not found
in the environment, any recoded microbe released from the
lab will die and not pose a threat. Synthetic auxotrophies
like the one just described will allow us to control when
and where genetically engineered microbes of unknown
risk can grow.

maybe even remember things—much like a computer?
These are all goals of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology is the design and construction of new biological parts,
devices, and systems for a desired purpose, similar to building electronic circuits.
How do we make these new parts or components? All
living organisms already contain an instruction set encoded
in DNA that determines what the creature looks like and
what it does. Humans have been altering the genetic codes
of plants and animals for millennia by selectively breeding individual plants and animals with desirable features.
Today, scientists easily take pieces of genetic information
from one organism and insert them directly into another,
bypassing the need to breed. This is the basis of genetic
engineering.
Recent technological advances now allow scientists to
synthesize and manipulate DNA in ways never before possible. By applying engineering principles to these genetic
manipulations, researchers can take components of genes
from several different organisms, link them together
like Lego blocks, and design new organisms that do
new things. For instance, Jay Keasling’s laboratory (UC
Berkeley) used genes from several species to engineer a
new pathway for artemisinin, an important antimalarial
drug. By exploiting E. coli, Keasling’s team eliminated
the effort required to chemically synthesize a structurally
complex molecule. In another example, Chang Li and colleagues (Harvard Medical School) engineered an E. coli
that prevented cancer in mice. The new strain contained
the invasin gene from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and the
hemolysin gene from Listeria monocytogenes. The invasin
gene allowed the modified E. coli to invade mouse cells.
The hemolysin enabled delivery of an inhibitory small
RNA molecule that reduced expression of a tumor-initiating gene. Amazingly, this novel E. coli prevented cancer
in this mouse model.

Principles of Synthetic Biology

The key to synthetic biology is engineering. Among the
more visually intriguing ways to apply engineering principles to biological systems involves the use of GFP as a visual
on-or-off output; that is, cells light up or go dark. If you
build the biological circuit correctly, you can make a population of bacteria alert you to the presence of a toxic compound by flashing on and off (Special Topic 12.1).
What engineering principles are employed by syntheticbiology scientists? Many of them are borrowed from the
field of electrical engineering and involve “logic gates.”
An electronic logic gate (as in semiconductors) receives a
tiny current as an input and produces voltage as an output. A genetic logic gate is simply a promoter and a gene.
An input signal such as a regulatory protein affects the

GENES AND GENOMES

We know that bacteria “talk” to each other using signaling molecules, but with synthetic biology can we also
train them to keep time? The answer appears to be yes.
Jeff Hasty’s laboratory at UC San Diego constructed a network circuit that relies on quorum sensing to propagate a
signal through a population of cells (Fig. 1). The network
design is shown in Figure 2. The organism, E. coli, was built
to contain the luxL gene from Vibrio fischeri and the aiiA
gene from Bacillus thuringiensis. LuxL synthase produces
an acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) autoinducer (see Chapter 10); AiiA is a secreted enzyme that degrades extracellular AHL. Both luxL and aiiA have a luxL promoter that can
be activated by LuxR bound to AHL. LuxR was also engineered into this synthetic organism, but it is constitutively
expressed. The output signal is a form of GFP, so the cells
glow when the circuit is on.
How does it work? Figure 3 shows what happens when
these cells are grown as a streak on an agar plate. The system produces a flash of emission that propagates bidirectionally along the streak and then shuts off. The flash starts
at a point in the colony where AHL stochastically accumulates at a low level. The secreted AHL reenters nearby cells,
where AHL binds LuxR and activates the expression of all
three circuits in the cell cluster. Those cells then glow (see
the 100-minute panel in Fig. 3). The new burst of AHL diffuses and activates more nearby cells, which also start to
glow (the 106- and 118-minute panels). Because the AHL
signal diffuses away from the producing cells, the light wave
propagates through the streak. However, the AiiA enzyme
that degrades AHL is also made and secreted by the glowing cells. AiiA degrades AHL and shuts the system off beginning where the light wave started (the 138-minute panel).
The remaining GFP is degraded by cell proteases, and cells
stop glowing. But now, without AHL, AiiA is no longer made.
Consequently, small amounts of AHL can again accumulate
at some point in the streak and the migrating flash begins
again (the 170- and 180-minute panels).

promoter, which drives the output signal (mRNA and protein). The output signal for one gate can be an input signal
for another part of the logic circuit. The final output signal
of the circuit does something useful or eye-catching (think
GFP fluorescence).
Many of the symbols used in building an electronic circuit are also used when building a complex genetic circuit.
Figure 12.21 shows three common logic gates used in synthetic biology and the symbols that represent them. The
first is a “buffer gate” that amplifies signals (Fig. 12.21A).
For a simple gene, the protein input activates a promoter;

(right) and Arthur Prindle examine a culture used for their
synchronous-clock experiments.
The system was then modified to be a sensor for arsenic.
For this purpose, luxR was placed under the control of a promoter repressed by ArsR. Arsenic inactivates the ArsR repressor. In the absence of arsenic, flashing was not seen, because
LuxR is needed to activate the luxP-gfp fusion. When even small

a message is then transcribed and a protein is made. With
a “NOT gate,” a protein input represses a promoter and
the output protein is not made (Fig. 12.21B). Finally, an
“OR gate” involves several genes. For instance, two alternative gene output proteins can activate a third gene. So,
in Figure 12.21C, the alternative input proteins I1 and I 2
activate gene 1 or gene 2, respectively, to make product 1
or product 2 (Pr1 or Pr2). Either of those output signals can
activate gene 3 to make product 3, Pr3 (such as GFP). Once
you understand how these gates work, you can make any
kind of circuit.

Toggle Switches

Electrical systems rely heavily on toggle switches to control whether a system is turned on or off. Similarly, synthetic-biology circuits depend on biological toggle switches.
Figure 12.22 illustrates a basic, genetically engineered toggle
switch designed to control whether a gfp gene is turned on
or off. The circuit involves two repressor genes (called NOT
gates) whose products can repress each other’s transcription.
The switch depends on whether one of two different inducer
signals is present. Inducer 1 inactivates repressor 1, which
means repressor 2 is produced. Repressor 2, in turn, stops

So, when inducer 1 is added, GFP is not made and the system
is stably toggled off. Alternatively, inducer 2 inactivates repressor 2, which means that the genes for repressor 1 and GFP are
transcribed and the cell lights up. The system is stably toggled
on because repressor 1 halts transcription of repressor 2. So,
a genetic engineer can control the on/off switch of these cells
by adding one or the other inducer. Of course, for this system
to toggle, at least a small amount of both repressor proteins
must be made at all times—just enough to bind to inducer
molecules and have an effect on gene expression.

systems discussed in Chapter 10. One component is the
gene for the AraC activator protein, which was linked by
Hasty’s group to a hybrid operator region that included
an ara activator sequence and a LacI repressor control
sequence. The next component is the gene encoding the
repressor LacI, which was also spliced to the hybrid ara

Before we discuss more complex circuits, we should first
talk about “noise.” Noise (variance from a mean) is a
problem in any electrical circuit but also arises in biological circuits, because of f luctuations of gene expression
among single cells in a population (see Section 12.1).
The concept of noise in a biological or electrical system
might be best explained by the following analogy. Imagine you are at a concert and your friend is trying to talk
to you. You can’t understand what she is saying, because
the sound of her voice is not rising above the music and
all of the background noise. The band would have to go
quiet in order for you to hear her. The same is true for
anything you want to measure. The less noise there is,
the easier it is to measure what rises above it. In bacteria,
translation inefficiency is a major contributor to noise,
although many factors can inf luence the expression of a
gene (Fig. 12.24). To be useful, synthetic biological circuits must operate with transcriptional and translational
controls balanced in a way that minimizes noise. Choosing the right ribosome-binding sequence and promoter,
as well as using a small R NA to control message stability
or translation, can help to decrease noise.

■ The basic synthetic riboswitch. Cis-repressed mRNA (crRNA) folds to obscure a ribosome-binding site (RBS) needed
to translate a downstream output gene (A). Trans-activating RNA (taRNA), driven by a different promoter (B), can base-pair with crRNA (C),
thus opening up the hairpin to expose the RBS. Whatever activates the taRNA will activate translation of the output genes’ mRNA.

riboswitch consists of two parts: a cis-repressed mRNA
(crRNA) and a trans-activating RNA (taRNA). The crRNA
sequence is linked to an output gene and, by forming a
hairpin, hides a ribosome-binding site to prevent translation. The taRNA, once it is made, will promote translation
of the output gene by base-pairing with the crRNA. The
base pairing releases the RBS for translation. Transcription
and translation of the output gene can now be manipulated
by whatever activates the promoters used to express the
crRNA and taRNA genes. This process can reduce noise
in a system.
Members of James Collins’s laboratory (Harvard University) designed a series of matched crRNA/taRNA riboswitches and linked them to various promoters and output
genes. The design and response of these circuits to various
environmental signals is shown in Figure 12.26. Notice
that each riboswitch responded to only one signal.
The Collins group then linked these riboswitches to
genes encoding carbon metabolism enzymes and placed
them all in the same cell, essentially making a metabolic
switchboard that could channel carbon flow through alternative metabolic pathways depending on which riboswitch
was activated. Metabolic switchboards would have important industrial applications. For instance, the device could
simultaneously sense a variety of metabolic states in a large

batch fermentation system and maximize the efficiency of
an industrially attractive pathway.

Kill Switches

Most of what we have described about synthetic biology has
little chance of dangerous unintended consequences, but
what about the long term? Biologists would like to engineer new strains that do new tasks, such as gobble up toxins in the environment. Remediating toxin contamination
in nature, however, would require the release of genetically modified organisms outside the laboratory. This raises
concerns about potential, unknown havoc these organisms
might cause.
To allay these concerns, scientists must engineer failsafe mechanisms that kill the organism at a predetermined point. Hence the quest for effective “kill switches.”
A genetically modified organism equipped with a kill
switch can be made to commit suicide once the bacterium’s job is done. One proof-of-principle kill switch
engineered by synthetic-biology techniques is shown in
Figure 12.27.
The gene for CcdB, a potent DNA-damaging toxin,
was linked to the promoter PLtetO , which is repressed by
the TetR protein. Repression is relieved (and CcdB is made)

only when an analog of tetracycline is present. Tetracycline binds
and inactivates TetR, which then
releases from the ccd promoter. As
a result, the kill toxin gene ccdB
is expressed and can kill the cell.
The engineers, however, added
a fail-safe mechanism to prevent
the organism from killing itself
too early. They made sure that
the translation of CcdB mRNA
is blocked by a crRNA. A second
component of the system, activated by arabinose, encodes the
compensatory taRNA that can
expose the RBS buried within the
crRNA-CcdB message. So, both
tetracycline and arabinose must
be added for the cell to effectively
produce CcdB and kill itself.
Although this system, as
designed, is impractical for realworld use, its success shows that
kill switches can be made. How
could this kill switch be modified so that it could be used in
the real world? What if repression
of CcdB was tied to the presence
of a toxic product found in the
environment? Once the organism destroyed the toxin, the kill
switch would be “thrown,” and
the bacterium would kill itself.

Despite its potential for good, one concern about synthetic biology is that anyone, theoretically, can do it. In
fact, the lure of constructing a new organism, combined
with the ever-lowering cost of equipment needed to carry
out these experiments, has spawned a community of doit-yourself (DIY) genetic engineers, including high school
students and so-called garage scientists. Most of these DIY

Tinkering with gene circuits is one thing, but carrying out
a complete genome transplant is another. We have been
able to manipulate small pieces of bacterial genomes for
many years via mutation, cloning, and recombination techniques. But manipulating an entire genome has been out of
reach—until now. Scientists have taken the genome of one
bacterial species, Mycoplasma mycoides, moved it to yeast
(they added a yeast centromere so that it would replicate),
modified the genome using yeast genetics, and then transplanted the modified genome into a different species, Mycoplasma capricolum, replacing the M. capricolum genome.
This biotechnological advance is especially exciting because
genetic manipulation of M. mycoides was previously impossible. Using this technique, we might redesign bacterial
systems and even engineer new species.

microbiome. Colonic bacteria compete intensely for the
carbon sources ingested by the host. But Bacteroides species
actually release their catabolic enzymes into the community,
by pinching off vesicles from the outer membrane. These
outer membrane vesicles contain enzymes that break down
lipids, carbohydrates, and peptides into small molecules.
Vesicle formation increases the surface area for catabolism,
but it also makes the catabolites available to unrelated
bacteria. This unexpected resource sharing is important for
the gut microbiome.

What is so exciting about intestinal
bacteria exporting catabolic enzymes
in vesicles?

Bacteroides species digest a broad
spectrum of polysaccharides in the
human gut, including host-derived
glycans. We showed that the bacteria
selectively secrete a large number of
sugar hydrolases via outer membrane
vesicles. The liposomal nature of vesicles stabilizes the
secreted hydrolases compared to the soluble form. Moreover, the secretion of hydrolases into vesicles enables the
bacteria to use out-of-reach nutrients.
How do you think our assumptions will change about
patterns of catabolism in the microbiome?

0.5 µm

Bacteroides fragilis can regulate the level of hydrolases
packed into outer membrane vesicles in response to the
kinds of glycans available. These results suggest that outer
membrane vesicle secretion is a regulated process that helps
Bacteroides adapt to its niche. Other researchers have shown
that Bacteroides vesicle hydrolases also target key molecules
in the host signaling pathways. In addition, vesicle sulfatases
play a fundamental role in the inflammatory response triggered by Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron during colitis.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

The intestines of humans and other animals support vast
communities of microbes that digest much of the food
we consume. Many of our gut microbes break down food
molecules using enzymes that our bodies don’t have—thus
extending the repertoire of our genome. The microbes
grow as mutualists, while our bodies provide a home in
return for breakdown of complex foods into small molecules that we can digest. Microbes catabolize (break down
for energy) many carbon sources that animals cannot. For
example, soil bacteria such as Pseudomonas species may
catabolize benzene and chlorinated pollutants.
But who would have thought that digestive bacteria are
also mutualists of each other? We have long assumed that
the vast number of intestinal microbes compete with each
other for food. Yet recent research shows that bacteria such
as Bacteroides species actually share their catabolic enzymes
with the community. The enzymes are shared by vesicles

pinched off from the bacterium’s outer membrane (see the
Current Research Highlight). The outer membrane (discussed in Chapter 3) contains enzyme complexes that break
down polysaccharides to oligosaccharides (short sugar
chains) and transport the oligosaccharides to the periplasm
(Fig. 13.1). These enzymes and transporters comprise the
“starch utilization system” (SUS). Within the periplasm,
oligosaccharides are further degraded to monosaccharides,
which then cross the inner membrane to the cytoplasm. At
the same time, some of the outer membrane pinches off to
form outer membrane vesicles. These vesicles include some
of the SusD starch-binding proteins, as well as glycosidases
(sugar breakdown), lipases (fat digestion), and peptidases
(protein breakdown). Their breakdown products diffuse
back to Bacteroides cells, as well as to other bacteria.
Why share catabolic enzymes? Amazingly, Bacteroides
species possess hundreds of SUS homologs for polysaccharide catabolism and transport. Catabolism is reactions that
break down complex organic substrates (discussed in Section 13.4). Different versions of SUS proteins catabolize
different types of polysaccharides, such as those with sulfated sugars. Suppose two different species possess enzymes
for different steps of a pathway. Individually, the two bacteria might not digest a certain substrate, but together they
may complete its breakdown. The surprising
nutritional cooperation of our microbiome
is discussed further in Chapter 21.

Living organisms need energy to build cells. Cell growth must spend energy while synthesizing biomass and

or cell growth. Energy is used to organize proteins, maintain ion gradients, and build biomass (Fig. 13.2). Yet the
second law of thermodynamics tells us that systems tend
to become less ordered and that entropy—the disorder, or
randomness, of the universe—always increases. For life to
build order out of disorder, cells need energy.

Many Sources of Energy

Collectively, microbes use more diverse energy sources
than do multicellular organisms (Table 13.1). Recall from
Chapter 4 that an organism may gain energy from chemical
rearrangement of molecules (prefix “chemo-”) or from light
absorption (prefix “photo-”). Chemotrophy yields energy
from electron transfer between chemicals, yielding products
that are more stable. Chemotrophy in which organic
compounds donate electrons to yield energy is known as
organotrophy or chemoorganotrophy. Organic compounds
include the foods we eat—which our intestinal bacteria
help catabolize. Most organotrophs are also heterotrophs,
organisms that use preformed organic compounds
for biosynthesis (a process called heterotrophy). But
chemotrophy also includes lithotrophy or chemolithotrophy
(literally “rock eating”), obtaining energy from inorganic
reactions. For example, the archaeon Pyrodictium occultum
gains energy by oxidizing hydrogen gas with sulfur.
Phototrophy yields energy from light absorption.
Phototrophs such as marine cyanobacteria are autotrophs.
A photoautotroph gains energy solely from light and builds
biomass solely from CO2. Other bacteria, such as purple

proteobacteria, practice photoheterotrophy, in which
energy from light supplements chemotrophy. Phototrophy
and lithotrophy are discussed in Chapter 14.
But all sources of energy pose the challenges of how to
obtain the energy, how to avoid losing it, and how to convert it for cell growth and function.

Note:

Distinguish the following prefixes for “-trophy” terms.

Carbon source for biomass
Auto- CO2 is fixed and assembled into organic molecules.
Hetero- Preformed organic molecules are acquired from outside and assembled into new organic molecules.
Energy source
Photo- Light absorption captures energy.
Chemo- Chemical reactions yield energy without absorbing
light.
Electron source
Litho- Inorganic molecules donate electrons.
Organo- Organic molecules donate electrons.

Microbes Use Energy to Build Order

Since the universe overall becomes more disordered, how
can microbes use energy to assemble less-ordered molecules into a complex cell? As order increases, the cell is
said to decrease in entropy, or disorder. But the decrease
in entropy is local to the cell, and temporary. Ultimately,
the cell’s energy must be spent as heat, which radiates away,

causing entropy to increase. In other words, the local, temporary gain of energy enables a cell to grow. Continued
growth requires continual gain of energy and continual
radiation of heat. We see this release of heat, for example, in
a compost pile, where heat is produced faster than it dissipates. The temperature of compost typically rises to 60°C.
Similarly, throughout Earth’s biosphere, the total
metabolism of all life must dissipate energy as heat. Biological heat production is not always obvious, because soil and
water provide a tremendous heat sink. But overall, Earth’s
biosphere behaves as a giant thermal reactor (Fig. 13.3). As
solar radiation reaches Earth, a small fraction is captured by
photosynthetic microbes and plants. The fraction captured
is largely in the range of visible light (Fig. 13.4), the wavelengths at which photon energies are appropriate for the
controlled formation and dissociation of molecular bonds.
Some bacteria conduct photosynthesis using ultraviolet and

near-infrared radiation. At shorter wavelengths (X-rays),
chemical bonds are broken indiscriminately; at longer wavelengths (microwaves and radio waves), the quantum energy
is too low to drive chemical reactions.
Microbial and plant photosynthesis generates biomass,
which is catabolized by consumers and decomposers. The
consumers store a small fraction of their energy in biomass.
At each successive level, the majority of energy is lost, radiated from Earth as heat. Thus, despite the growth of living
organisms on Earth, the universe as a whole becomes more
disordered. The complex roles of microbial metabolism in
global ecosystems are discussed in Chapters 21 and 22.

Note:

The principles of energy change, discussed next, apply
to all the reactions of Table 13.1. These reactions are covered in
detail in Chapters 13 and 14.

from Earth as heat.

Gibbs Free Energy Change

From Table 13.1 we see that microbes can harness an
enormous variety of chemical reactions for growth. But
what determines whether a given reaction can support life?
Gibbs free energy change (ΔG). To provide energy to a cell,
a biochemical reaction must go forward from reactants to
products. The direction of a reaction can be predicted by a
thermodynamic quantity known as the Gibbs free energy

Solar radiation

■

ΔH = change in enthalpy, the heat energy absorbed
or released as reactants become products at constant
pressure. When reactants absorb heat from their
surroundings as they convert to products, ΔH is positive.
When, instead, heat energy is released,
ΔH is negative. Release of heat (negative
value of ΔH) can yield energy for the cell
to use. An example of a reaction with
negative ΔH is the oxidation of glucose
by O2.

change, ΔG (also known as free energy change or Gibbs
energy change). The ΔG value of a reaction determines how
much energy is potentially available to do work, such as to
drive rotary flagella, to build a cell wall, or to store accurate
information in DNA. The sign of the free energy change,
ΔG, determines whether a process may go forward. If ΔG is
negative, the process may go forward, whereas positive values mean that the reaction will go in reverse. The sign of
ΔG determines which “foods” a microbe can eat or, more
precisely, which reactions between available molecules can
be harnessed for microbial growth.
Under defined laboratory conditions, calculating the
ΔG value of a reaction can predict how much biomass
microbes will build (Fig. 13.5). Figure 13.5A lists various reactants for catabolic reactions performed by our gut
bacteria, and by bacteria in soil. When oxygen is available,
oxidative catabolism of sugars or of short-chain fatty acids
yields relatively large amounts of energy. Once oxygen is
used up, some bacteria can oxidize food with an alternative
electron acceptor, such as nitrate (NO3 –)—a process called
anaerobic respiration. Alternatively, bacteria can ferment
the carbon source with no mineral oxidant. Whatever the
reaction, a linear relationship appears between ΔG and the
biomass produced (Fig. 13.5B). In natural environments,
however, the changing concentrations of substrates and
products make the ΔG calculation more complicated.

ΔS = change in entropy, or disorder.
Entropy is based on the number of
states of a system, such as the number of possible conformations of a
molecule. If a cellular reaction splits
one molecule into two, all else being
equal, entropy increases; the system
is more disordered, and ΔS is positive. Most catabolic reactions have a
positive value of entropy change. A
positive value of ΔS makes ΔG more
negative and increases the potential
energy yield of a reaction.

The relationship of the free energy change ΔG with ΔH and
ΔS is given by:
ΔG = ΔH – TΔS
The overall sign of ΔG depends on its two components:
ΔH (the absorption or release of heat energy) and –TΔS [the
negative product of entropy change (ΔS) and temperature
(T)]. In living organisms, a sufficiently negative ΔH (energy
lost as heat) often overrides –TΔS, the term for increase in
order (negative value of ΔS, positive value of –TΔS). Thus,
a living organism, whose development entails increasing
order and decreasing ΔS, can grow as long as the sum of
its metabolism has a sufficiently negative value of ΔH. The
heat loss associated with ΔH is obvious in a compost pile,
where temperature rises. Similarly, all living organisms and
communities lose heat.

Note: The joule (J) is the standard SI unit to denote energy.
1 kilojoule (kJ) = 1,000 joules. Another unit commonly used is the
kilocalorie (kcal). The conversion factor is: 1 kJ = 0.239 kcal.

Enthalpy and Entropy in Metabolism

How do ΔH and –TΔS affect biochemical reactions? Each
reaction in a living cell is associated with these two types
of energy change, but to differing degrees depending on
the reaction. In general, a reaction yields energy for the
cell if:

Negative ΔG Drives a Reaction Forward

2H 2 + O2 → 2H 2O
In this reaction, two molecules of hydrogen gas donate
four electrons to oxygen, forming water. Under conditions

ΔG = ΔH – TΔS
= –572 kJ/mol – (298 K)
[–0.327 kJ/(mol · K)]
= –572 kJ/mol + 97 kJ/mol
= –475 kJ/mol

Overall, ΔG is negative, so bacteria with the appropriate enzyme pathways can use the reaction of hydrogen gas
with oxygen to provide energy.

■

An example of a thermodynamically favored reaction is
the oxidation of hydrogen gas (H2) to form water. Hydrogen is oxidized for energy by many kinds of bacteria in soil
and water (a form of lithotrophy discussed in Chapter 14).
For example, hydrogenotrophic bacteria of the genus Ralstonia have been isolated from ultrapure water used for nuclear
fuel storage, where radioactive ionization generates H2. The
chemical reaction of dissolved hydrogen and oxygen gases is:

of standard temperature (298 kelvins,
or K) and pressure (sea level), ΔH =
–572 kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol).
The ΔH is strongly negative (much
heat is released) because the bonds of
the product H 2O are much more stable
than those of the substrates H 2 and O2.
However, entropy decreases because
the three molecules are replaced by
two—a more ordered state. Thus, ΔS
is negative [ΔS = –0.327 kJ/(mol · K)].
In the Gibbs equation the negative sign
on the entropy term –TΔS makes its
contribution to ΔG positive—unfavorable for reaction. So which term wins:
ΔH or –TΔS?

■

Molecular stability increases. When reactants combine
to form products with more stable bonds, the reaction
has a negative ΔH. For example, the reaction of a sugar
with oxygen has a negative ΔH because the relatively
unstable oxygen molecules are reduced to H 2O.
Entropy increases. Reactions in which a complex molecule is broken down to a greater number of smaller
molecules increase entropy (positive ΔS, negative value
of −TΔS). An important class of such product molecules
is carboxylic acids, such as lactic acid, in which a H+ dissociates from a carboxylate ion (R–COO –). Entropy also
increases with conversion of a solid reactant to a gas,
such as CO2. For example, glucose may be fermented
to ethanol and CO2, as in the production of alcoholic
beverages.

CHAPTER 13

The relative contributions of ΔH and –TΔS are important because they determine the effect of temperature on
microbial growth. ΔH-dependent reactions such as glucose
oxidation release a lot of heat, causing, for example, the
rise in temperature of an aerated compost pile. By contrast,
the entropy component of Gibbs energy, –TΔS, does not
reflect heat loss. The magnitude of –TΔS grows larger as
temperature increases. An extreme case of entropy-driven
metabolism is that of acetate conversion to methane and
CO2, conducted by soil archaea such as Methanosarcina
barkeri. This methanogen’s growth is driven solely by the
increase in entropy (–TΔS). But the sign of ΔH is positive;
thus the organism actually absorbs heat and cools its environment. Despite the positive ΔH, the larger magnitude of
the entropy change –TΔS allows the reaction to proceed,
yielding net free energy.
How do we measure ΔG and its components, ΔH and
–TΔS? The amount of energy released by a reaction is measured in an instrument called a calorimeter. A calorimeter
may be designed to measure thermal energy (heat) released
by a reaction of pure chemicals in a test tube, or of metabolizing bacteria—or even a large farm animal (Fig. 13.6).
The cow’s thermal energy includes microbial digestion
coupled to its own digestive processes, and to its own cellular biosynthesis; what is measured is residual energy lost as
heat. In a calorimeter, the release of heat during a reaction
(or collection of reactions) maintained at constant temperature gives a measure of ΔH. Measurement conducted
at various temperatures (T) yields the temperature dependence of heat release, from which we calculate –TΔS. The
sum of the two components yields ΔG.

Energy enables cells to build ordered structures out of
simple molecules from the environment.
Cells release heat continually because transfer of
energy is never perfectly efficient.
The free energy change (ΔG) includes enthalpy (ΔH),
the heat energy absorbed or released; and –TΔS, the negative product of temperature and entropy change (ΔS).
Most reactions include both ΔH changes (such as oxidation-reduction) and ΔS changes (such as breakdown to a
larger number of products).
Negative values of ΔG show that a reaction can drive
the cell’s metabolism. The sign of ΔG depends on the
relative magnitude of ΔH and –TΔS.
ΔH-driven reactions release heat.
TΔS-driven reactions do not release heat, but they cause
a greater change in free energy (ΔG) at higher temperature.

Thought Questions

13.1 Consider glucose catabolism in your blood, where the
sugar is completely oxidized by O2 and converted to CO2:
C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O
Do you think this reaction releases greater energy as heat, or
by change in entropy? Explain.

13.2 The bacterium Lactococcus lactis was voted the official
state microbe of Wisconsin because of its importance for
cheese. During cheese production, L. lactis ferments milk
sugars to lactic acid:

Large quantities of lactic acid are formed, with relatively small
growth of bacterial biomass. Why do you think biomass is
limited? Cheese making usually runs more efficiently at high
temperature; why?

Energy in Biochemical
Reactions

For a given reaction in a given environment, many factors
determine ΔG. These factors fall into two classes—those
intrinsic to the reaction, and those dependent on the
environment:

these properties relative to arbitrary standard conditions
such as concentration and temperature.
Concentrations and environmental factors. The
direction of the reaction depends on the concentrations of reactants and products. An excess of reactants
over products makes ΔG more negative (favoring the
forward reaction), whereas an excess of product makes
ΔG more positive (favoring the reverse reaction). Reaction direction also depends on environmental factors
such as temperature, pressure, and ionic strength (salt
concentrations).

Standard Reaction Conditions

Scientists commonly present thermodynamic values under
standard conditions for temperature, pressure, and concentration. The standard conditions enable scientists to compare the intrinsic properties of reactions. The standard
Gibbs free energy change is designated ΔG°. The standard
conditions for ΔG° are as follows:
■

The temperature is 298 K (25°C).

■

The pressure is 1 atm (standard atmospheric pressure).

■

All concentrations of substrates and products are
1 molar (M).

For every chemical compound, a standard ΔG° of formation can be determined by chemical measurement. We
obtain the ΔG° for a molecular reaction under standard
conditions by summing the ΔG° values of the products, and
subtracting the sum of ΔG° values of the reactants. A table
of standard ΔG° values and a sample calculation are provided in Appendix 1.
But the ΔG° values reported in data tables hold only for
isolated reactions under “standard reaction conditions.”
Standard conditions differ greatly from the actual conditions of living cells. These conditions include temperature,
ionic strength, and gas pressure (in the case of gaseous
components, such as CO2), as well as the concentrations
of reactants and products. To account for some differences,
biochemists add special standard conditions: the hydrogen
ion concentration at pH 7, because living cells commonly
maintain their cytoplasm within a unit of neutral pH; and
the water concentration of 55.5 M for dilute solutions. The
free energy change in biochemistry is thus designated ΔG°′.
The additivity of energy change is central to all living
metabolism. Additivity makes it possible to do work by
coupling an energy-yielding reaction to an energy-spending
reaction (see Section 13.3). Figure 13.7 shows an example,
the initial reaction of glycolysis (see Section 13.5), in which
ATP phosphorylates glucose to glucose 6-phosphate, catalyzed by the enzyme hexokinase. In this reaction, the loss
of a phosphoryl group from ATP yields energy, some of

ΔG3°′ = –16.7 kJ/mol

Note:

Distinguish these forms of the Gibbs free energy term:

ΔG = change in Gibbs free energy for a reaction under defined
conditions.
ΔG° = ΔG at standard conditions of temperature (298 K) and pressure (1 atm, sea level), with all reactants and products at a
concentration of 1 M. (Table of values in Appendix 1.)
ΔG°′ = ΔG at standard temperature, pressure, and concentrations
for ΔG°, plus the biochemically relevant conditions of pH 7
(H+ concentration of 10–7 M) and water (H2O concentration of
55.5 M; activity = 1). Some biochemists standardize additional
factors, such as magnesium ion concentration ([Mg2+] = 1 mM).

Concentrations of Reactants
and Products

In living cells, the concentrations of reactants and products
usually differ from 1 M; for example, in the E. coli cytoplasm,

CHAPTER 13

the concentrations of ATP and Pi are about 8 mM. Thus, the
actual ΔG of reactions within a cell differs from ΔG° or ΔG°′.
Consider a reaction in which reactants A and B are
reversibly converted to products C and D:
A+B

C+D

Higher concentration of reactants (A or B) drives the reaction forward, whereas higher concentration of products
drives it in reverse. So, ΔG includes the ratio of products
to reactants:
[C][D]
ΔG = ΔG° + RT ln
[A][B]
[C][D]
= ΔG° + 2.303RT log
[A][B]
where R is the gas constant [R = 8.315 × 10 –3 kJ/(mol ·
K)] and T is the absolute temperature in kelvins (298 K,
or 25°C). The factor 2.303 converts the logarithm of the
ratio of products to reactants from base e (ln) to base 10
(log). Note that in ΔG°′ calculations, the water “activity”
(concentration modified by a constant) is set at 1. The logarithm of 1 equals zero, so the water activity falls out of the
equation.
Table 13.2 shows how the concentration ratio affects ΔG.
In reactions at medium temperature (25°C–40°C), a 100fold increase in the ratio of products to reactants adds about
11 kJ/mol to ΔG. ΔG is then less negative and the reaction
less favorable. On the other hand, a 100-fold decrease in the
concentration ratio makes ΔG more negative by –11 kJ/mol.
In some environments, a highly negative concentration term can override a positive ΔG°, resulting in a reaction with negative ΔG that microbes can use for energy.
For example, in an iron mine the high concentration of
reduced iron favors iron-oxidizing microbes. Alternatively,
a high temperature may increase the magnitude of the term
2.303RT log [products]/[reactants] when it is negative,

until it overrides a positive ΔG°. This temperature dependence of ΔG is observed in thermophiles such as Sulfolobus,
which metabolizes sulfur at 90°C; these sulfur reactions
could not go forward at lower temperatures.
Another way the direction of reaction may change is
for a second metabolic process to remove one of the reaction’s products (C or D) as fast as it is produced. The
decrease in product concentration could then change the
ΔG of the first reaction to a negative value. For example,
when our intestinal bacteria break down glucose to pyruvate (see Section 13.5), many of the individual reactions
have ΔG°′ values smaller than 5 kJ/mol. Their actual direction of reaction in the cell depends on concentrations of
products and reactants. Glycolytic reactions with near-zero
ΔG°′ are reversible and can, in fact, participate in the biosynthetic pathway of gluconeogenesis (glucose biosynthesis, discussed in Chapter 15).
A surprising discovery has been that many bacteria and archaea in natural environments grow extremely
slowly, using energy-yielding metabolism with values of
ΔG approaching zero (that is, near thermodynamic equilibrium). When the actual ΔG (under actual reaction conditions) equals zero, a reaction proceeds equally forward and
in reverse, and there is no net change in energy. At equilibrium, the ratio of product and reactant concentrations
exactly cancels ΔG° or ΔG°′:
ΔG = 0 = ΔG° + 2.303RT log
ΔG° = – 2.303RT log

[C][D]
[A][B]

[C][D]
[A][B]

Living cells can never grow exactly at equilibrium
(ΔG = 0). But most soil bacteria and archaea gain energy from
anaerobic metabolism with near-zero values of ΔG. Such
organisms must form biomass very slowly, but if no other
metabolism is available, they may outgrow competitors. The
discovery of low-ΔG energetics has opened new possibilities
for environmental remediation previously thought impossible, such as the anaerobic digestion of complex organic pollutants in contaminated soil (see Section 13.6).
Some of the near-zero anaerobic pathways involve syntrophy, an intimate metabolic relationship between two species. Jessica Sieber at the University of Illinois and Michael
McInerney at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, show
how syntrophy works for microbes that break down pollutants (Special Topic 13.1). For syntrophy, a bacterium catabolizes reactants by a reaction that has a positive ΔG°′ value,
while H 2-oxidizing organisms such as methanogens complete the reaction with a net negative ΔG°′. The bacterial
catabolism provides H 2 gas, which the partner species consumes, thus keeping H 2 concentration low enough to drive
the syntrophic reaction. Analogous partnerships may link
many catabolic reactions of gut bacteria (see Chapter 21).

SPECIAL TOPIC 13.1, , Microbial Syntrophy Cleans Up Oil

NEIL WOFFORD, UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA

Have you ever wondered how to clean up polluted soil and
water? Michael McInerney at the University of Oklahoma, Norman, thinks about cleanup from the point of view of microbial energetics (Fig. 1). As the son of a wastewater treatment
engineer in Chicago, he learned early on about pollution in the
Great Lakes. Later, in Oklahoma, he realized that there was
a growing problem of water supplies contaminated by sewage and waste petroleum. He began to study how microbes
catabolize sewage components, such as the short-chain acids

FIGURE 1 ■ Jessica Sieber at the University of Illinois

University of Oklahoma, Norman.

propionate and butyrate, and aromatic oil compounds such as
benzoate.
A fundamental challenge to degrading these pollutants is
the lack of oxygen. The molecules seep into the depths of soil
or water, where any oxygen is quickly used up by microbes
capable of respiration. Jessica Sieber, as a postdoctoral fellow, took up the challenge of elucidating anaerobic pathways
to degrade aromatics. Since her move to the University of Illinois, Sieber has kept her focus on anaerobic life, tweeting as
@SyntrophySieber, “I tune out when O2 is mentioned!”
As microbes use up the long-chain components of sewage
or oil, the remaining short-chain molecules and aromatic rings
can be broken down only by transferring leftover electrons
onto hydrogen ions, forming H2. For example, Syntrophus aciditrophicus and Syntrophomonas wolfei catabolize benzoate
into acetate and bicarbonate ions, releasing H2 (Table 1).
But the H2-releasing reactions of Syntrophus and Syntrophomonas have a positive value of ΔG° (see Table 1), and thus
they cannot go forward to yield energy. So how can these
bacteria obtain energy? The ΔG can be shifted by rapidly
removing H2 gas, thus lowering the concentration of this key
product. Once the equations are balanced, negative values of
ΔG are obtained. H2 can be removed by other microbes that
oxidize hydrogen using alternative electron acceptors such
as bicarbonate (the archaeal methanogen Methanospirillum),
sulfate or nitrate (the bacterium Desulfovibrio) (Fig. 2A).
Hydrogen-producing bacteria have evolved to grow in
close proximity to the hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria or archaea.

within a wastewater sludge granule, where anaerobic catabolism must degrade sewage components to CO2. The granule
is stained with fluorescent markers for the H2-producing bacteria (red) and their partner methanogen (yellow). In order for
the syntrophy to proceed, the H2 from the catabolizing bacteria must be transferred quickly to the methanogenic partner,
by processes that are not yet understood. Genomic analysis of
Syntrophus aciditrophicus reveals genes for flagellar motility,
suggesting that flagellar motility helps the cell find its partner
in order to form an association. Microscopy reveals intercellular nanotubes that may transmit electrons from the H2 producer to the partner.
Under laboratory conditions, Sieber and McInerney demonstrated syntrophic growth in the presence of defined
concentrations of reactants and products (Table 1). Their calculations showed that cells grew with negative values of free
energy change. Yet even in the presence of the syntrophic
partner, these anaerobic pathways have free energy changes
that are remarkably low (about –20 kJ/mol), often below
the theoretical minimum required to generate ATP (about
–60 kJ/mol). Such extremely low energy levels require
special arrangements called “reverse electron transport,” in
which electrons are transferred from one carrier to the next,
despite a positive ΔG value (requiring energy input). The elec-

tron transfer must be coupled with a compensating reaction
that spends enough energy to yield a net negative ΔG.
Syntrophic partnerships are considered “thermodynamic
extremophiles” because they grow at such low ΔG values.
Nonetheless, these organisms are of global importance
because they play an essential role in recycling the smallmolecule products of anaerobic catabolism. Furthermore,
they present exciting industrial applications. For instance,
the methanogenic partnership between H2-producing bacteria and Methanococcus maripaludis might be used to attack
unextractable oil residues and convert the carbon into methane for recovery as natural gas. Other syntrophic interactions
may be used to increase the efficiency of sewage mineralization during water treatment.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Thought Question

A. Diffusion: positive ∆S

13.3 The thermophilic bacteria Thermus species grow
in deep-sea hydrothermal vents at 80°C. It was proposed that they metabolize formate to bicarbonate ion
and hydrogen gas:
HCOO – + H2O → HCO3– + H2
But the standard ΔG°′ is near zero (–2.6 kJ/mol). Under
actual conditions, do you think the reaction yields
energy? Assume concentrations of 150 mM formate,
20 mM bicarbonate ion, and 10 mM hydrogen gas.

Concentration Gradients

B. Transmembrane gradient

So far, our discussion of energy has assumed an isotropic system, in which concentrations are the same
everywhere. But a living cell needs to obtain its molecules from outside, such as sugars, amino acids, and
inorganic ions (discussed in Chapter 4). Suppose a
blood pathogen needs to obtain a scarce substance
such as iron (Fe2+). How does the microbe move the
iron “uphill” against its concentration gradient?
A substance dissolved in water diffuses by random
movements until its distribution has the same concentration throughout (Fig. 13.8A). The random
distribution of molecules at uniform concentration
represents the state of greatest entropy. Diffusion in the
environment ultimately brings nutrients into contact with
microbial cells, even cells that lack chemotactic motility to
hunt for food. For example, sugars in the food we eat diffuse through our saliva to reach the bacteria growing in
biofilms on our teeth.
The cell membrane contains transporters for useful
molecules, allowing nutrient molecules to cross. Entropy
favors their movement from higher to lower concentration
(Fig. 13.8B). In most environments, however, the nutrients are at lower concentrations than inside the cell. To
obtain these molecules from outside, the bacterial cell must
transport them against their gradient—that is, from lower
to higher concentration—increasing the concentration difference and thus decreasing entropy. Uptake against a concentration gradient requires an energy source to power
transport proteins embedded in the membrane (as shown
in Chapter 4). Alternatively, a transmembrane gradient of
ions can store energy for the cell. The most important ion
gradient is the H+ gradient, a component of the proton
motive force (to be explained in Chapter 14).

Energy is required
to move molecules
up the gradient.

By convention, standard conditions are set to define ΔG°
(for biochemists, ΔG°′).

Intrinsic properties of the reaction determine the
standard value of ΔG°. Properties include the molecular

■

Concentrations of reactants and products affect the
actual value of ΔG. The lower the concentration ratio of
products to reactants, the more negative the value of ΔG.
Environmental factors such as temperature and pressure
also affect ΔG.
Within living cells, energy-yielding reactions are coupled with energy-spending reactions. The measurement of energy flow under changing conditions requires
calculations more complex than those shown here.
A concentration gradient stores energy. Solutes run
down their concentration gradient unless energy is
applied to reverse the flow. Gradient energy can be interconverted with energy from chemical reactions.

CHAPTER 13

13.3

Energy Carriers and
Electron Transfer

Our ΔG equations show only the total energy of a reaction
such as glucose oxidation. If all the energy were released
at once, however, it would dissipate as heat without building biomass. In living cells, glucose is never oxidized in
one step. Instead, the energy yield is divided among a large
number of stepwise reactions with smaller energy changes.
In this way, the cell can be thought of as “making change”
by converting a large energy source to numerous smaller
sources that can be “spent” conveniently for cell function
and biosynthesis. The “spending” of energy is controlled
by enzymes that couple all of the energy-providing reactions to specific energy-spending reactions.

Energy Carriers Gain and
Release Energy

Many of the cell’s energy transfer reactions involve energy
carriers. Examples of energy carriers are ATP (adenosine
triphosphate) and NADH (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). Energy carriers are molecules
that gain and release small amounts of energy in reversible
reactions. Energy carriers are used to transfer energy in a
wide range of biochemical reactions.

■

ENERGETICS AND CATABOLISM

■

489

Some energy carriers, such as NADH, transfer energy
associated with electrons received from a food molecule. A
molecule that transfers, or “donates,” electrons to another
molecule is called an electron donor or a reducing agent;
a molecule that receives, or “accepts,” electrons is called
an electron acceptor. For example, during glucose catabolism a molecule of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate transfers a pair of electrons (2e –) with a hydrogen ion (H+) to
NAD+, forming NADH. NAD+ is an electron acceptor that
receives the electrons; it then becomes the electron donor
NADH. Electron donors such as NADH transfer electrons
from reduced food molecules to a terminal electron acceptor such as oxygen (see Chapter 14). Energy carriers that
transfer electrons are needed for all energy-yielding pathways and for biosynthesis of cell components such as amino
acids and lipids (see Chapter 15).
Note that in living cells, all energy transfer reactions
are coupled by enzymes to specific biochemical processes.
Without enzyme coupling, energy dissipates and would be
lost from the living system.

ATP Carries Energy

Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP (Fig. 13.9A), is composed of a base (adenine), a sugar (ribose), and three
phosphoryl groups. Note that adenine-ribose-phosphate
(adenosine nucleotide) is equivalent to a nucleotide of

RNA. The base adenine is a fundamental molecule of life,
one that forms spontaneously from methane and ammonia
in experiments simulating the origin of life on early Earth
(discussed in Chapters 1 and 17). Like the sugar ribose,
ATP is an ancient component of cells, found in all living
organisms.
Under physiological conditions, ATP always forms a
complex with Mg2+ (Fig. 13.9B). The magnesium cation
partly neutralizes the negative charges of the ATP phosphates, stabilizing the structure in solution. Most enzymebinding sites for ATP actually bind Mg2+-ATP. This is one
reason why magnesium is an essential nutrient for all living
cells.

ATP is a “medium-sized” energy carrier, since the
cell contains many phosphorylated molecules that yield
greater energy upon hydrolysis. Table 13.3 summarizes
examples of free energy change associated with hydrolysis
of various phosphoryl groups. As we will see, phosphoryl
group hydrolysis with ΔG°′ values larger than –31 kJ/mol
can yield energy that is stored by ATP formation. ATP

hydrolysis can yield energy to phosphorylate molecules at

The phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP requires energy
input (positive ΔG).
Why does ATP formation require energy? The inorganic phosphate molecule has four oxygen atoms that
share a negative charge. When phosphate reacts with
another phosphate to form a bond, the charged oxygens
of adjacent phosphates are forced to interact despite charge
repulsion. The charge repulsion in ATP limits rotation of
oxygens, and thus decreases entropy, which results in a
negative ΔG of hydrolysis. Hydrolysis of each phosphoryl
group yields energy. The formation and hydrolysis of ATP
can be shown as:

Glucose 6-P + H2O → glucose + Pi

Reaction of hydrolysis

■

Hydrolysis releasing phosphate. The hydrolysis of
ATP at the terminal phosphate consumes H 2O to produce ADP and Pi, releasing energy. The energy released
by ATP hydrolysis can be transferred to a coupled reaction of biosynthesis, such as building an amino acid. The
two reactions are coupled by an enzyme with binding
sites specific for ATP and the substrate.
Hydrolysis releasing pyrophosphate. ATP can hydrolyze at the middle phosphate, releasing pyrophosphate
(PPi). The pyrophosphate usually hydrolyzes shortly
afterward to make 2 Pi. Overall, the release of 2 Pi from
ATP yields approximately twice as much energy as the
release of 1 Pi. Pyrophosphate release and subsequent
hydrolysis drives a reaction strongly forward, because
twice as much energy would be required to reverse the
reaction. Pyrophosphate is released in reactions that
must avoid reversal—for example, the incorporation of
nucleotides into growing chains of RNA.
Phosphorylation of an organic molecule. ATP can
transfer its phosphate to the hydroxyl group of a molecule such as glucose to activate the substrate for a subsequent rapid reaction. No inorganic phosphate appears,
and no water molecule is consumed:
ATP + glucose → ADP + glucose 6-P

Some enzymes catalyze ATP transfer of phosphate to
activate sugar molecules for catabolism. Other enzymes

CHAPTER 13

couple the phosphorylation of a sugar to its transport across
the cell membrane; consequently, these enzymes make up
the phosphotransferase system (PTS). The PTS enzymes
play a critical role in determining which nutrients from the
environment some microbes can acquire and catabolize
(discussed in Chapter 4).

Note that, besides ATP, other nucleotides carry energy.
Guanosine triphosphate (GTP) provides energy for ribosome elongation of proteins. And the phosphodiester
bonds of all four nucleotide triphosphates, as well as their
corresponding deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, carry
energy for their own incorporation into RNA and DNA,
respectively.

Thought Questions

13.4 When ATP phosphorylates glucose to glucose
6-phosphate, what is the net value of ΔG°? What if ATP
phosphorylates pyruvate? Can this latter reaction go forward
without additional input of energy? (See Table 13.3.)
13.5 Linking an amino acid to its cognate tRNA is driven by
ATP hydrolysis to AMP (adenosine monophosphate) plus pyrophosphate. Why release PPi instead of Pi?
ATP produced by glucose catabolism. A large number of

ATPs can be formed by coupling ATP synthesis to the
step-by-step breakdown and oxidation of a food molecule
such as glucose. In theory, complete oxidation of glucose
through respiration can produce as many as 38 ATP molecules. The overall ΔG°′ of the coupled reactions is:
C6H12O6 + 6H 2O + 6O2 →
12H 2O + 6CO2

ΔG°′ = –2,878 kJ/mol

38[ADP + Pi → ATP + H 2O]

ΔG°′ = 38 × (+31 kJ/mol)

Net ΔG°′ = –1,700 kJ/mol
The difference in ΔG°′ for the coupled reactions is the energy
lost as heat and entropy—in this case, –1,700 kJ/mol
(–2,878 kJ/mol + 1,178 kJ/mol). Thus, the maximal efficiency of energy capture by ATP is about 40%, a level that
may be approached by highly efficient systems such as
mitochondria. When ΔG values are corrected for cellular
concentrations of reactants and products, the actual efficiency may be greater than 50%. Under conditions such as
low oxygen concentration, much smaller amounts of ATP
are made per molecule of glucose. For comparison, the efficiency of a typical machine, such as an internal combustion
engine, is about 20%.
Thought Question

13.6 In the microbial community of the bovine rumen, the
actual ΔG value has been calculated for glucose fermentation
to acetate:
C6H12O6 + 2H2O → 2C2H3O2– + 2H+ + 4H2 + 2CO2
ΔG = –318 kJ/mol
If the actual ΔG for ATP formation is +44 kJ/mol and each
glucose fermentation yields four molecules of ATP, what is the
thermodynamic efficiency of energy gain? Where does the
lost energy go?

NADH Carries Energy and Electrons

Another major energy carrier is nicotinamide adenine
dinucleotide, or NAD (NADH, reduced; NAD+, oxidized). Unlike ATP, NADH carries energy associated with
two electrons that reduce a substrate (Fig. 13.10). NADH
carries two or three times as much energy as ATP, depending on cell conditions. During sugar catabolism, NADH
carries electrons from breakdown products of glucose. Its
oxidized form, NAD+, receives two electrons (2e –) plus a
hydrogen ion (H+) from a food molecule; a second H+ from
the food molecule enters the solution. Overall, reduction
of NAD+ consumes two hydrogen atoms to make NADH:
NAD+ + 2H+ + 2e – → NADH + H+

ΔG°′ = +62 kJ/mol

For this reaction, ΔG°′ is positive; therefore, it requires
input of energy from the catabolism of the food molecule.
The reduced energy carrier NADH can then reverse this
reaction by donating two electrons (2e –) to another molecule, regenerating NAD+.

Note:

A hydrogen ion, or “proton” (H+), does not exist free in
solution. In water, a H+ combines with H2O to form a hydronium ion
(H3O+), but for clarity we use H+. An atom of hydrogen removed
from a C–H bond consists of a proton (H+) plus an electron (e–). In
a reaction, the proton and electron may be transferred to one molecule or to separate molecules.

NADH structure and function. NAD+ consists of an ADP

molecule attached to nicotinamide instead of a third phosphate. The nicotinamide mononucleotide, like a ribonucleotide, contains a nitrogenous base attached to a sugar
phosphate. In NAD+, the nicotinamide has a ring structure (shaded orange in Fig. 13.10A) that forms a stable
cation.
NAD+ is a relatively stable structure because the ring
electrons are aromatic; that is, the bonding electrons delocalize around the ring, as in benzene. Aromatic rings that
contain noncarbon atoms are said to be heteroaromatic.
Many biologically active molecules are heteroaromatic,
including adenine and other nucleotide bases. A heteroaromatic ring is stable, but its disruption requires less energy
than the disruption of benzene. Thus, it is possible to disrupt the ring by adding two electrons with H+ eliminating
one double bond. The donation of electrons eliminates the

energy in an amount useful for cell reactions.
The electrons transferred to NADH eventually must
be put somewhere else, onto the next electron acceptor. If
NADH builds up in a cell, no NAD+ remains to continue
oxidizing food molecules. One way that the energy stored

ΔG°′ = –62 kJ/mol
ΔG°′ = –158 kJ/mol
ΔG°′ = –220 kJ/mol

Thus, the total energy released during NADH oxidation
through the ETS is –220 kJ/mol (–62 kJ/mol – 158 kJ/mol).
This energy is converted to transmembrane proton potential (composed of the H+ concentration difference plus the
charge difference across the membrane). The proton potential (see Chapter 14) drives nutrient transport, motility, and
synthesis of ATP.

Note:

Reduction potentials, electron transport, and proton
motive force are discussed further in Chapter 14.

Other energy carriers that transfer electrons. Different
steps of metabolism utilize different but related energy carriers. For example, NADPH differs from NADH only in
its extra phosphate attached to the 2′ carbon of adenine
nucleotide; the amount of energy carried is the same. Some
enzymes can utilize both NADPH and NADH, whereas
other enzymes use only one or the other.

Another related energy carrier is flavin adenine dinucleotide, or FAD (FADH 2, reduced; FAD, oxidized), in
which flavin substitutes for nicotinamide. The flavin nucleotide includes a ring structure whose aromaticity is eliminated by its receiving two electrons (Fig. 13.10B). The
redox function of the flavin isoalloxazine ring system is
similar to that of NADH:
FAD + 2H+ + 2e – → FADH 2
Like NADH, FADH 2 donates 2e – to an electron acceptor.
FADH 2 is a weaker electron donor than NADH, but when
FADH 2 is combined with a strong electron acceptor such
as O2, electrons are transferred and significant energy is
released:
ΔG°′ = –42 – 158 = –200 kJ/mol
Why do different kinds of reactions use different energy
carriers?
■

■

Different redox levels. Food molecules may have more
or fewer electrons (level of reduction/oxidation) than
those associated with the cell structure. For example,
lipids are more highly reduced than glucose. Thus, lipid
catabolism requires a greater proportion of electronaccepting energy carriers (such as NAD+ or NADP+)
than does glucose catabolism, and it makes relatively few
ATP molecules directly. A combination of energy carriers with different redox states enables cells to balance
their overall redox potential while transferring energy.
Different amounts of energy. Biochemical reactions
yield different amounts of energy—that is, different
values of ΔG. Suppose a reaction can provide more than
enough energy to generate ATP from ADP (31 kJ),
but not quite enough to generate NADH from NAD+
(62 kJ). An example is the conversion of succinate to
fumarate in the TCA cycle (see Section 13.6). Succinate

conversion provides the energy to reduce FAD to
FADH 2, whose oxidation by O2 can yield two molecules
of ATP. Thus, the use of FADH 2 enables the cell to
make more efficient use of its food than if generation of
ATP or NADH were the only choices.
■

Regulation and specificity. Specific energy carriers can
direct metabolites into different pathways serving different functions. For example, in many bacteria NADH is
directed into the ETS, whereas NADPH, the 2′-phosphorylated form of NADH, is directed into biosynthesis
of cell components such as amino acids and lipids.

The concentrations and reduction level of energy carriers provide much information on the state of a cell, such
as the effects of environmental stress on cell metabolism.
But energy carriers such as NADH undergo rapid turnover
(interconversion with NAD+). How can we observe NADH
and ATP concentrations within living cells? One method
uses nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (discussed in eTopic 13.1). The use of NMR to observe living
cells led to the development of magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to observe the entire human body.

Enzymes Catalyze Metabolic Reactions

In living cells, each reaction must occur only as needed, in
the right amount at the right time. The rate of a reaction is
determined by the activation energy (E a), the input energy
needed to generate the high-energy transition state on
the way to products (Fig. 13.11). Most biochemical reactions require an activation energy that exceeds the average
kinetic energy of the reactant molecules colliding. Thus, no
matter how negative the ΔG, the reaction will proceed at a
significant rate only when the activation energy is lowered
by interaction with a catalyst, an agent that participates in a
reaction without being consumed.

FIGURE 13.11 ■ Enzymes lower the activation energy of the
transition state. In the presence of an enzyme, the activation
energy of the reaction is decreased, allowing rapid conversion of
reactants to products.

Biological reactions are catalyzed by enzymes, structures composed of protein (or, in some cases, RNA) that
bind substrates of a specific reaction. The enzyme lowers
the activation energy by bringing the substrates in proximity to one another and by correctly orienting them to
react. In some cases, enzymes provide a reactive amino acid
residue to participate in a transition state between reactants
and products. Microbial enzymes have growing importance in industry; they are used for food production, fabric
treatment, and drug therapies (discussed in Chapter 16).
Enzymes couple specific energy-yielding reactions
(such as those of glucose breakdown) with the cell’s reactions requiring energy, such as making ATP. An example
of coupled reactions is shown in Figure 13.12. The substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), a phosphorylated breakdown product of glucose, is converted to pyruvate while
the phosphate is added to ADP to generate ATP:

The ΔG°′ of phosphate cleavage from PEP is –62 kJ/
mol, whereas the ΔG°′ of ATP formation is only +31 kJ/
mol. Thus, the net ΔG°′ is negative (–31 kJ/mol), and the
reaction goes forward to pyruvate. But a high activation
energy makes the reaction extremely slow; without help,
it rarely goes forward on the timescale of life. The reaction proceeds only when the two reacting substrates (PEP
and ADP) are coupled by the enzyme pyruvate kinase (Fig.
13.12A). Pyruvate kinase has specific binding sites for each
of its substrates: PEP and ADP. ADP and PEP are brought
together by the enzyme and positioned so as to lower the
activation energy of phosphate transfer.
In addition to the catalytic site, the enzyme has an
allosteric site (a regulatory site distinct from the substratebinding site) for its activator, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate.
The difference between a substrate-binding site and an
allosteric site can be seen in the molecular model based on
X-ray crystallography (Fig. 13.12B). The allosteric site is
found at a distance from the substrate-binding site, but its
interaction with the regulator, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate,
alters the conformation of the entire enzyme, increasing the
rate of reaction. As we will see, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate
is a central intermediate of glycolysis; thus, it makes sense
that as this molecule builds up, it activates pyruvate kinase
to remove products farther down the chain of catabolic
reactions, maintaining the steady flow of metabolites.
Thought Question

13.7 What would happen to the cell if pyruvate kinase

catalyzed PEP conversion to pyruvate but failed to couple this
reaction to ATP production?

Note that pyruvate kinase is actually named for its
reverse reaction: pyruvate phosphorylation to PEP. The
enzyme may have been named for activity that was originally observed in the reverse direction, before the cell function was understood. Enzymes can catalyze both forward
and reverse reactions. The predominant direction of catalysis depends on the concentrations of substrates and products (which determine ΔG) and on allosteric regulators.

13.4

Catabolism: The
Microbial Buffet

In the early twentieth century, it was thought that microbes
could catabolize a limited subset of naturally occurring
organic molecules, such as sugars. Molecules not known
to be catabolized were termed “xenobiotics,” especially
if they were “synthetic” products of human industry. We
have since found that virtually any organic molecule can
be catabolized by a microbe that has evolved the appropriate enzymes. Catabolism by microbes in our own digestive
system helps us digest complex food molecules. Catabolism
also plays key roles in microbial disease; for example, the
causative agent of acne, Propionibacterium acnes, degrades
skin cell components such as lipids.

Note:

The allosteric regulator
changes the enzyme
conformation to allow
substrate binding.

Besides releasing energy, the breakdown of organic
food molecules provides substrates for biosynthesis. Biosynthesis
is covered in Chapter 15.

Substrates for Catabolism

Here we present several important classes of catabolic
substrates (Fig. 13.13). While in principle virtually any
organic constituent may be catabolized, certain kinds of
substrates are used more rapidly because they require less
activation energy or fewer types of enzymes to break them
down. Many of these substrates form products important
to our nutrition and technology. Others, such as aromatic
components of petroleum, are environmental pollutants
that only bacteria and fungi can degrade (see Section 13.6).
Carbohydrates. Carbohydrates (sugars and sugar poly-

mers, or polysaccharides) (Fig. 13.13A), are important as
structural components of cells, and for their central role
in human digestion. Microbial catabolism is central to our
production of food and drink (presented in Chapter 16).
Glucose as such is rarely available to microbes, except to
pathogens growing within a host. But the pathways of glucose catabolism complete the digestion of a diverse range
of food molecules found in the environment. The main
carbohydrates digested by human enzymes are starches,
glucose polymers in which an acetal (O–COH) condenses
with a hydroxyl group, releasing H 2O.
But intestinal bacteria such as Bacteroides species can
digest a far greater range of polysaccharides, such as the
cellulose of plant cell walls and the pectin of fruit. Such

polysaccharides were originally defined as “fiber”—that is,
polymers indigestible by humans. We now know that partial digestion of fiber contributes significant caloric content
to the human diet. Members of the gut microbiome are so
important that human breast milk contains specific types
of carbohydrates to feed them.
Plant-derived polysaccharides are long molecules that
cannot be taken up by cells. Instead, microbes secrete
enzymes that initiate extracellular digestion (see Fig. 13.1).
Sugar chains are broken down by microbial enzymes,
first to short chains (oligosaccharides), then to two-sugar
units (disaccharides), and then to monosaccharides such

as glucose or fructose. In some sugars, the aldehyde is
replaced by a hydroxyl (sorbitol, mannitol) or a carboxylate
(gluconate, glucuronate). Polysaccharides are hydrolyzed to
products that enter central catabolic pathways such as glycolysis (Fig. 13.14).
Lipids. Many bacteria catabolize lipids (Fig. 13.13B)

from sources such as milk, animal fats, and nuts. The
oxidation of lipid catabolites causes the rancid odor of
spoiled meat or butter (issues of food microbiology,
discussed in Chapter 16). Microbes catabolize lipids
by hydrolysis to glycerol and fatty acids (Fig. 13.14).

■ Many carbon sources enter central pathways of catabolism.
Carbohydrates are broken down by specific
enzymes to disaccharides and then to monosaccharides such as glucose. Glucose and sugar acids are converted to pyruvate, which releases
acetyl groups. Acetyl groups or acetate are also the breakdown products of fatty acids, amino acids, and complex aromatic plant materials
such as lignin.

Glycerol, a three-carbon triol (a compound with three–OH
groups), can be considered a three-carbon sugar; it commonly enters catabolism as an intermediate of glycolysis. Alternatively, other pathways break down glycerol to
acetate. Fatty acids, more highly reduced than glycerol,
undergo oxidative breakdown by the fatty acid degradation (FAD) pathway, forming acetyl groups. These acetyl groups enter the TCA cycle when a terminal electron
acceptor is available; alternatively, they enter fermentation
or anaerobic syntrophy.

Peptides. We commonly think of proteins as essential parts
of a cell. However, when present in excess, proteins can be
catabolized to provide energy. Initially, proteins are broken
into peptides (Fig. 13.13C) by sequence-specific proteases.
Peptides are then hydrolyzed to individual amino acids
(Fig. 13.14). Some pathogens catabolize specific amino
acids as part of the disease process. For example, Legionella
pneumophila, the cause of legionellosis, catabolizes threonine. Threonine catabolism is required for the pathogen
to grow within macrophages, a type of white blood cells.

498

■

PART 3

■

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Thus, threonine catabolism may be a target for new drugs
against L. pneumophila.
Specific enzymes catalyze the early steps in the degradation of each amino acid until products are formed that
can enter common pathways of carbohydrate catabolism
or the TCA cycle. The initial step of amino acid degradation is one of two kinds: decarboxylation (removal of CO2)
to produce an amine, or deamination (removal of NH3) to
produce a carboxylic acid. Carboxylic acids are degraded
through the TCA cycle. Amine products, such as cadaverine and putrescine, are often excreted, causing the noxious
odor of decomposing flesh.
Aromatic molecules. Aromatic compounds are more dif-

ficult to digest than sugars because of the exceptional
stability of aromatic ring structures. Yet many bacteria
metabolize benzene derivatives, and even polycyclic aromatic molecules, either partly or all the way to CO2. A particularly important aromatic substance found in nature is
lignin (Fig. 13.13D), which forms the key structural support of trees and woody stems. A discouragingly complex
molecule, lignin is made from six-carbon sugars converted
to benzene rings, with ether connections that are difficult
for enzymes to break down. Fungi and soil bacteria catabolize lignin to oxidized benzene derivatives such as benzoate and vanillin (Fig. 13.14). Further breakdown produces
acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle.

Today, the environment contains increasing amounts
of human-made aromatic compounds, produced for herbicides and other industrial uses, that are highly toxic pollutants. These include halogenated aromatics, such as
polychlorinated biphenyls, the source of highly toxic dioxins. Halogenated aromatics turn out to be catabolized by a
number of soil microbes, which are promising candidates
for bioremediation of polluted environments (described in
Section 13.6). Other types of aromatic molecules catabolized by microbes are polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs). Found in petroleum, the multiple fused rings of
PAH compounds build up in natural environments—but
with time, microbes can catabolize them and remediate the
soil (see Section 13.6).

Products of Catabolism

What is the ultimate fate of all the bits of organic carbon
chewed up by microbial catabolism? The answer has myriad consequences for human nutrition and environmental
cycling, as well as food and industrial production. From
Table 13.1, recall two major forms of catabolism: fermentation, in which all the electrons from organic substrates
are put back onto the organic products; and respiration,
in which the electrons removed are ultimately transferred
to an inorganic electron acceptor such as oxygen or nitrate
(anaerobic respiration). In a third case, photoheterotrophy,

Respiration. Respiration combines catabolic breakdown

of organic molecules with electron transfer to a terminal
electron acceptor such as oxygen. Respiration yields far
more energy from catabolism than does fermentation. For
humans, respiration is synonymous with breathing; but in
the absence of O2, many microbes use alternative electron
acceptors such as nitrate (see Chapter 14).

Catabolism: Molecular and Cell Biology

In natural ecosystems, how do cells manage to break down
complex carbon sources? Free-living bacteria and fungi
may catabolize thousands of different carbon sources,
each requiring specific transporters and enzymes for initial breakdown. Most of these, particularly complex plant
constituents, are not digestible by animals, whose genomes
fail to encode the necessary enzymes. The only polysaccharides that human enzymes can digest are starch, lactose,
and sucrose. Yet human breast milk includes a mixture of
complex milk oligosaccharides, including branched chains
of N-acetylglucosamine, sialic acid, and fucose. Amazingly,
our own breast milk has evolved to support bacteria with
specific catabolic abilities to colonize the infant gut.
It is well known that animals such as cattle require
microbes living within their digestive tracts to ferment cellulose from grasses or wood. We now know that humans,
too, require related bacteria to digest a variety of plantderived fibers. For example, both cattle and humans contain
anaerobes of the Gram-negative genus Bacteroides and the
Gram-positive genus Ruminococcus (originally named for
the bovine rumen). By evolving a symbiosis with microbes,
animals avoid the need to acquire new catabolic genes in
their own genome. The microbial genomes are functionally part of the human metagenome, the total sequence of
genomes of a community of organisms.
The genome sequence of our microbiome determines our
ability to digest common foods such as lettuce and tomatoes (Fig. 13.15). The major polysaccharide fibers of these

vegetables are xyloglucans, beta-linked glucose polymers

Ann Arbor, and Johan Larsbrink at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, investigated how lettuce
and tomato fibers are digested in our microbiome.
Each type of xyloglucan requires a slightly different set
of genes, called a polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL).
The PULs evolved from a common ancestral starch utilization system (SUS). Most gut bacteria possess a number
of PULs distributed around their genomes, showing evidence of horizontal gene transfer and evolution of genomic
islands (discussed in Chapter 9). Figure 13.16A shows
the xyloglucan PUL for each of four different species of
Bacteroides found in the human gut. The DNA sequences
of these species show synteny—that is, sufficient similarity

sans air (“life without air”), fermentation is the partial
breakdown of organic food without net transfer of electrons
to an inorganic terminal electron acceptor. Thus, food ferments without oxygen. Fermentation has a negative ΔG,
owing to breakdown of a large molecule to several smaller
products, which are usually more stable as well. Examples
of fermentation pathways include ethanolic fermentation
producing alcoholic beverages, and lactate fermentation by
lactic acid bacteria producing cheese and yogurt. (We will
discuss more examples; also see Table 13.5).

of sequence and map position to predict common ancestry
(discussed in Chapter 17). Surprisingly, only a small minority of our gut microbiome possesses the ability to digest
xyloglucans. Thus, the caloric content we receive from lettuce and tomatoes depends on just a few key members of
our gut community.
How do our gut bacteria actually handle complex food
sources such as xyloglucans? Since bacteria have solid cell
walls and are incapable of phagocytosis, a bacterium cannot
take up a large food particle, but it can secrete enzymes or
place enzymes on the outer membrane to break down the

fibers into short oligosaccharides (Fig. 13.16B). The PUL
genes encode outer membrane–inserted enzymes (GH5A
and GH9A in Fig. 13.16B) that specifically cleave xyloglucans. Other genes encode oligosaccharide outer membrane
transporters (SusC and SusC-related proteins). Within the
periplasm, various amylases break down the oligosaccharides to monosaccharides. The monosaccharide products
are then transported across the inner membrane into the
cytoplasm, where they undergo glycolysis (discussed in the
next section). Metagenome analysis reveals hundreds of
Sus homologs, called Sus-like systems, that target different

CHAPTER 13

polysaccharides; these comprise, for example, 18% of the
genome of Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron.
In a complex environment, with numerous potential
substrates for catabolism, how does a given microbe decide
what to eat first? Organisms select substrates on the basis
of their availability and energy efficiency. Substrate selection involves gene regulation, as discussed in Chapter 10.
For example, in E. coli the sugar lactose induces transcription of genes that encode beta-galactosidase (lacZ) and
lactose permease (lacY). But in the presence of glucose, a
preferred carbon source, lac transcription is halted. Halting lac transcription enables preferential catabolism of
glucose. The process of prioritized consumption of substrates is known as catabolite repression (presented in
Chapter 10).
As we saw in Figure 13.14, the products of catabolism of many diverse substrates ultimately funnel into a
few common pathways of metabolism. The remainder of
this chapter presents key pathways in detail: glycolysis and
other pathways of glucose catabolism, the TCA cycle, and
the catechol pathway of benzoate catabolism. These pathways play key roles in medical microbiology and in industrial fields such as bioremediation.

Carbohydrates, or polysaccharides, are broken down
to disaccharides, and then to monosaccharides. Sugars and sugar derivatives, such as amines and acids, are
catabolized to pyruvate.
Pyruvate and other intermediary products of sugar
catabolism are fermented, or they are further catabolized to CO2 and H 2O through the TCA cycle (in the
presence of a terminal electron acceptor) or to CO2, H 2,
and CH4 through fermentation and syntrophy.

Glucose Breakdown
and Fermentation

C6H12O6 → 2C3H4O3 + 4H (2 NADH + 2H+)
Under anaerobiosis—the prevailing condition of many
microbial habitats—the pyruvate obtained from sugar
breakdown must be converted to compounds that receive
electrons from NADH, in order to restore the electronaccepting form NAD+. Different microbes reduce pyruvate
to different end products of fermentation. Alternatively,
through respiration, NADH may reduce an electron acceptor such as oxygen or nitrate, allowing pyruvate to feed into
the TCA cycle (discussed in Section 13.6).

Note:

The carboxylic acid intermediates of metabolism exist
in equilibrium with their dissociated, or ionized, forms, identified
by the suffix “-ate.” For example, lactic acid dissociates to lactate;
acetic acid dissociates to acetate. We use the “-ate” terms for acids
whose ionized form predominates under typical cell conditions
(around pH 7).

To catabolize glucose, bacteria and archaea use three
main routes to pyruvate (Fig. 13.17):
■

■

Fermentation and respiration complete the process
of catabolism. In fermentation, the catabolite is broken
down to smaller molecules without an inorganic electron acceptor. Respiration requires an inorganic terminal electron acceptor such as O2.
Catabolism of complex substrates requires specialized
enzymes and transporters. Different bacteria contain
homologous SUS or PUL complexes that fit different
carbon sources.

ENERGETICS AND CATABOLISM

For microbes feasting on complex carbohydrates, the main
breakdown product is glucose. Glucose catabolism is important as a widespread source of energy, and also as a source of
key substrates for biosynthesis, such as five-carbon sugars to
build nucleic acids (discussed in Chapter 15).
Glucose and related sugars are catabolized through
a series of phosphorylated sugar derivatives. A common
theme in sugar catabolism is the splitting of a six-carbon
substrate into two three-carbon products. The threecarbon products may form two molecules of pyruvate:

Lipids and amino acids are catabolized to glycerol and
acetate, as well as other metabolic intermediates.
Aromatic compounds such as lignin and benzoate
derivatives are catabolized to acetate through different
pathways, such as the catechol pathway.

■

Glycolysis, or the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP)
pathway, in which glucose 6-phosphate isomerizes to
fructose 6-phosphate, ultimately forming two molecules
of pyruvate. EMP is used by many bacteria, eukaryotes,
and archaea. From each glucose, the pathway generates
net 2 ATP and 2 NADH.
Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway, in which glucose
6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate, a phosphorylated sugar acid. Alternatively, sugar acids may be
converted directly to 6-phosphogluconate. Sugar acids
often derive from intestinal mucus, and the ED pathway
is essential for enteric bacteria to colonize the intestinal epithelium. The ED pathway generates only 1 ATP,
1 NADH, and 1 NADPH.
Pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), also known as
the pentose phosphate shunt, in which glucose 6-phosphate is oxidized to 6-phosphogluconate, and then

Glycolysis: The EMP Pathway

The Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) pathway, or
glycolysis, is the form of glucose catabolism most commonly studied in introductory biology; it is central for
animals and plants, as well as many bacteria. In the EMP
pathway, one molecule of D-glucose undergoes stepwise
breakdown to two molecules of pyruvic acid (or its anion,
pyruvate) (Fig. 13.18). Glucose is broken down in two
stages. In the first stage, the glucose molecule is primed for
breakdown by two steps of sugar phosphorylation by ATP.
Each ATP phosphotransfer step spends Gibbs free energy,
as we saw for glucose 6-phosphate formation in Table
13.3. The phosphoryl groups tag two sides of the glucose
molecule for subsequent splitting into two three-carbon
molecules of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).
In the second stage, each glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
is oxidized by NAD+ through steps leading to pyruvate.
Each conversion of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate to pyruvate
forms 2 ATP—one ATP molecule from dephosphorylation
of the substrate, and one from addition of inorganic phosphate. Since 2 ATP were spent originally to phosphorylate
glucose, the net gain of energy carriers from each glucose is
2 NADH plus 2 ATP.
Most of the conversion steps are associated with a small
change in energy—so small that the sign of ΔG depends
on the concentrations of substrates or products; thus, some
individual steps are reversible. In the cytoplasm, however,
as intermediate products form they are quickly consumed
by the next step, so the pathway flows in one direction. The
direction of flow is determined by the key irreversible reactions that consume ATP. These steps drive the pathway by
spending energy.

(Fig. 13.19, left). The fi rst phosphoryl group (phosphate) is added at carbon 6 of glucose. (In some species of
bacteria, the fi rst phosphoryl group is
added by phosphoenolpyruvate instead
of ATP, but the net effect is the same.)
The next enzyme-catalyzed step—
rearrangement of glucose 6-phosphate
to fructose 6-phosphate—involves no
significant change in energy but prepares the sugar to receive the second
phosphoryl group, forming fructose
1,6-bisphosphate.
The sugar then splits into two threecarbon sugars (trioses), each tagged
with one of the two phosphates. The

splitting of this molecule has a favorable entropy change
(ΔS), but its enthalpy change (ΔH) is unfavorable, largely
canceling out the energy yield. The two triose phosphates—
glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) and dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP)—have nearly the same energy,
so an enzyme interconverts them reversibly. Interconversion is necessary because only G3P proceeds further in the
pathway.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

First, the aldehyde (R–CHO) is converted to the carboxylate ion (R–COO –) plus H+. Conversion to a carboxylate releases a substantial amount of energy (negative ΔG).
This oxidation of the aldehyde represents the major source
of energy in glycolysis—the step at which the energy
obtained is used to transfer a pair of electrons onto NAD+,
forming NADH (with an ionized H+). In addition, sufficient energy is released to add a phosphoryl group (from
inorganic phosphate, Pi) to the carboxylate, generating
1,3-bisphosphoglycerate.
In subsequent steps, the added phosphoryl group will
be transferred to ADP, yielding net 1 ATP per pyruvate
(2 ATP per glucose). The transfer of a phosphoryl group
from an organic substrate to make ATP is called substratelevel phosphorylation. With subtraction of the initial two
ATP molecules invested, the net energy carriers gained
from each glucose molecule are as follows:

(breakdown) and anabolism (biosynthesis) are called
amphibolic.
The amphibolic pathway of glycolysis includes enzymes
that can run in either direction, such as phosphoglucose
isomerase. The direction of the pathway at a given time is
determined by key enzymes that operate only in the catabolic direction or in the anabolic direction. For example, in
glycolysis the ATP phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate
is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphofructokinase, whereas
in biosynthesis this step is reversed by a different enzyme,
fructose bisphosphatase. Instead of regenerating ATP, fructose bisphosphatase removes the second phosphoryl group
as inorganic phosphate—a step yielding energy and thus
driving the whole pathway in reverse (toward biosynthesis
of sugar). The two enzymes are regulated differently; the
catabolic enzyme phosphofructokinase is activated by ADP,
a signal of energy need, whereas the biosynthetic enzyme is
inhibited by such signals.

The Entner-Doudoroff Pathway

Regulation of glycolysis. Enzymes of catabolism are

The Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway offers a slightly
different route to catabolize sugars, as well as sugar
acids (sugars with acidic side chains). The ED pathway
was originally studied for its role in production of the
Mexican beverage pulque, or “cactus beer,” by Zymomonas
fermentation of the blue agave plant. Later, Tyrrell Conway
and colleagues discovered genes encoding the EntnerDoudoroff enzymes in the genomes of many bacteria and
archaea. In the human colon, the ED pathway enables E.
coli and other enteric bacteria to feed on mucus secreted by
the intestinal epithelium (Fig. 13.20). Some gut flora, such

regulated at the level of transcription of the enzyme.
In addition, the activities of certain enzymes in long
pathways require allosteric regulation. Allosteric regulation
by enzyme substrates and products ensures that excess
intermediates do not build up, and it avoids releasing more
energy than the cell can use at a given time. Glycolysis is
regulated so that its reactions go forward only when the
cell needs energy, not when the cell is trying to synthesize
glucose. The regulation occurs at steps where the products
are consumed so rapidly that their forward reaction is
effectively irreversible. Irreversible steps are shown as
unidirectional arrows in Figure 13.19.
Thought Question

A.

B.

Enzymes that catalyze irreversible steps are regulated so
as to maintain consistent levels of intermediates in the pathway. The most important irreversible reaction in glycolysis
is the phosphorylation of fructose 6-phosphate to fructose
1,6-bisphosphate, mediated by the enzyme phosphofructokinase. This enzyme is activated allosterically by ADP and
inhibited by ATP or by the alternative phosphoryl donor,
phosphoenolpyruvate.
What happens when the cell needs to reverse glycolysis
in order to make glucose? Most of the intermediate reactions are reversible, so the same enzymes can be used for
biosynthesis. Pathways that participate in both catabolism

production of the mucus that they consume. These bacteria
that “farm” intestinal mucus enhance human health by
preventing pathogen colonization, and by stimulating the
immune system.
The ED pathway appears to have evolved earlier than
the EMP pathway, because it involves fewer substrate phosphorylation steps and produces less ATP, and it is found
in a wider range of prokaryotes. As in the EMP pathway, glucose is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate
(Fig. 13.21). The next step, however, involves oxidation
by NADP+ at carbon 1, with loss of two hydrogens to form
6-phosphogluconate, a sugar acid. Gluconate is also found
in intestinal mucus; the sugar acid can be phosphorylated
to enter the ED pathway.
During ED, the hydrogens and electrons from glucose
6-phosphate are transferred to NADP+ instead of NAD+ as
in the EMP pathway. This step differs from the EMP pathway in two respects: The carrier used is NADP+ instead of
NAD+, and the electrons are transferred earlier, without a
second ATP-consuming phosphorylation step. When the

only 1 ATP per molecule of glucose—half that of the EMP
pathway (see Fig. 13.21, inset). The electrons transferred,
however, are equivalent: Instead of 2 NADH, the EntnerDoudoroff pathway generates 1 NADH and 1 NADPH.
What is the significance of NADPH, compared to
NADH? In most cases, NADH transfers electrons to the
ETS to store energy, whereas NADPH is used for biosynthesis (see Chapter 15). Thus, enzymes for amino acid
biosynthesis will use NADPH but not NADH. The ratio
between NADH and NADPH enables cells to balance their
need for energy with their need to build biomass.
Thought Question

13.9 Explain why the ED pathway generates only 1 ATP,

whereas the EMP pathway generates 2 ATP. What is the
consequence for cell metabolism?

The Pentose Phosphate Pathway

A third pathway of glucose catabolism is the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), which forms the key intermediate
ribulose 5-phosphate, a five-carbon sugar. The pentose
phosphate pathway generates 1 ATP with no NADH, but
2 NADPH for biosynthesis (Fig. 13.22). In addition, the
PPP generates a complex series of intermediates that can be
redirected as substrates for biosynthesis of diverse cell components such as amino acids and vitamins.
The pentose phosphate pathway starts like the
Entner-Doudoroff pathway: Glucose 6-phosphate gives
up two electrons to form NADPH and is oxidized to
6-phosphogluconate. The next step involves a second
oxidation by NADP+, with loss of a carbon as CO2. The loss
of CO2 generates the five-carbon sugar ribulose 5-phosphate
(hence the pathway name “pentose phosphate”). In
succeeding steps, pairs of sugars, such as sedoheptulose
7-phosphate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, exchange
short carbon chains, giving rise to sugar phosphates of
various lengths—for example, ribose 5-phosphate and
erythrose 4-phosphate, which are precursors of purines and
aromatic amino acids, respectively. Alternatively, if these
routes to biosynthesis are not taken, the intermediates
convert to fructose 6-phosphate and reenter the EMP
pathway, where ATP and NADH are produced.

Fermentation Completes Catabolism

None of the pathways from glucose to pyruvate constitute
completed pathways of catabolism, because NADH (and
for some pathways NADPH) remains to be recycled. In the

absence of oxygen or other electron acceptors, heterotrophic cells must transfer the hydrogens from NADH + H+
back onto the products of pyruvate, forming partly oxidized
fermentation products with the same redox level (balance of
O and H) as the original glucose had (see Table 13.5). For
example, the pyruvate may be converted to lactate by adding two electrons (with two hydrogen atoms) at the ketone,
generating an alcohol group. The product, lactic acid, has
a number of atoms (C3H6O3) equal to half of the original
glucose (C6H12O6). Overall, one glucose is converted to
two molecules of lactic acid—a process called lactic acid
fermentation:

How does lactic acid fermentation yield energy to be
stored as ATP? While two molecules of lactic acid contain
the same number of atoms and electrons as those found in
glucose, the molecular bonds are rearranged to form two
carboxylic acids. The carboxylate/carboxylic acid has multiple states and increased entropy compared to the hydroxyl
groups of glucose. Overall, glucose conversion releases free
energy, and the reaction has a net negative value of ΔG. The
ATP formation in such a reaction is called substrate-level
phosphorylation because it involves only substrate reactions, no proton pumping across membranes (discussed in
Chapter 14).
Alternative pathways of fermentation produce two molecules of ethanol plus two CO2 molecules (ethanolic fermentation) or one lactic acid, one ethanol, and one CO2
(heterolactic fermentation). Other kinds of fermentation
are shown in Table 13.5. In all cases, fermentation products must be excreted from the cell. The large quantities of
substrate consumed in fermentation generate large amounts
of waste products to be excreted. These bacterial wastes are
actually useful to human “fermentation industries” such as
the production of alcoholic beverages (ethanolic fermentation) or cheese (lactic acid fermentation).
Why do fermenting bacteria give up such large quantities of waste products that retain usable energy? The reason
is that in the absence of oxygen (or another electron acceptor), the fermentation products cannot yield energy. Most
fermentation pathways do not generate ATP beyond that
produced by substrate-level phosphorylation, the direct
transfer of a phosphate group from an organic phosphate

to ADP. An example is the final step of glycolysis, catalyzed
by pyruvate kinase (see Fig. 13.19). Much of the energy
available from glucose remains unspent or is lost as heat.
Nevertheless, fermentation is essential for microbes in environments such as anaerobic soil or animal digestive tracts.
Even aerated cultures of bacteria start fermenting once
their demand for oxygen exceeds the rate of oxygen dissolving in water. Microbes compensate for the low efficiency
of fermentation by consuming large quantities of substrate
and excreting large quantities of fermentation products. An
advantage of fermentation is that the rapid accumulation of
acids or ethanol can inhibit growth of competitors.
Mixed-acid fermentation. Numerous pathways have evolved

to dispose of the waste in different forms (Fig. 13.23).
E. coli ferments by a combination of routes known collectively as mixed-acid fermentation, forming acetate, formate, lactate, and succinate, as well as ethanol, H 2, and
CO2. Hydrogen (H 2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are the
main gases passed by the human colon.
Colonic H 2 plus CO2 can yield further energy for methanogenic microbes, through conversion to methane (discussed in Chapter 14). Excess hydrogen and methane
gases can cause problems for medical procedures such as
colonoscopy. For colonoscopy, the colon may need to be
flushed with a carbohydrate solution, which bacteria may
ferment, releasing hydrogen. When a polyp is removed
from the colon by electrocautery (high-frequency electric
current), the gas may ignite, causing an explosion. Colonic
explosion can be avoided by flushing out the gases before
electrocautery.
During mixed-acid fermentation, the proportions of
products vary with pH. Low pH favors ethanol and lactate
(which minimize acidification) over formate and acetate.
Clostridium species produce alcohols (butanol, isopropanol); Porphyromonas gingivalis, a cause of periodontal disease, produces short-chain acids (propionate, butyrate).

Many fermentation products share key intermediates,
such as acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is a versatile two-carbon
intermediate that serves as the “Lego block” of metabolism. The molecule consists of an acetyl group esterified
to coenzyme A (CoA) (Fig. 13.24), an important coenzyme whose discovery won Fritz Lipmann the 1953 Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine. CoA has a thiol (SH) that
exchanges its hydrogen for an acyl group, thus activating
the molecule for transfer in various metabolic pathways.
For example, the enzyme pyruvate formate lyase splits
pyruvate to form acetyl-CoA plus formate:

Acetyl-CoA

The SH group of CoA accepts the acetyl group to form
acetyl-CoA. The hydrogen (H+ + e –) of the SH group is
transferred onto the carboxyl carbon of pyruvate, generating formate.
Acetyl-CoA can be converted to various fermentation
products by several different pathways. The simplest is an
exchange of water with CoA, forming acetate:
CH3CO—S-CoA + H 2O

CH3COO – + H++ HS-CoA

Incorporation of water restores the hydrogen to the thiol of
CoA, and the OH to acetate. The acetate thus formed may
then be excreted by the cell.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

In soil ecosystems, various other fermentations have
evolved to utilize available substrates (see Table 13.5).
Clostridium species generate butanol and other solvents of
great industrial value. Other species ferment pairs of amino
acids, in a type of mechanism called the Stickland reaction. Fermenting a pair of amino acids avoids generating
H 2 (a loss that would waste reduction potential) and produces as much as 3 ATP. By contrast, the succinate fermentation of Propionigenium modestum is an anaerobic
reaction that proceeds with too small a ΔG value to generate a single ATP. Instead, the decarboxylation step (catalyzed by methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase) is coupled to
the pumping of sodium ions across the cell membrane. The
sodium pump stores energy (discussed in Chapter 14).

Food and Industrial Applications

The “waste products” of fermentation retain much of their
organic structure and food value. Their carbon-hydrogen
bonds retain the ability to reduce oxygen, and their organic

structures can be used for biosynthesis. Thus, fermentation
products have proved extremely useful in human culture
and technology. For thousands of years, ethanolic fermentation by yeast has been used to produce wine and beer,
while lactic acid fermentation has been used to produce
yogurt and cheese (see Chapter 16). The minor product
butyric acid (butyrate) lends taste to butter.
Fermentations involving amino acids generate small
amounts of products with intense odors and flavors. Products of amino acid catabolism confer some of the distinctive
flavors of fermented foods and beverages, such as cheese.
Swiss cheese is produced in two fermentation stages. In the
first stage, at high temperature, thermophilic lactic acid
bacteria such as Lactobacillus helveticus and Streptococcus
salivarius ferment the milk sugar lactose, a disaccharide of
glucose and galactose, generating mainly lactic acid. In the
second stage, Propionibacterium freudenreichii converts
lactate to propionate, acetate, and CO2, which bubbles to
form the “eyes” (Fig. 13.25). The propionate contributes
to the distinctive flavor of Swiss cheese, along with other
minor side products that have intense flavors. For more on
Swiss-cheese fermentation, see eTopic 13.2. Microbial food
production is discussed in Chapter 16.
In the chemical industry, microbial fermentation produces industrial solvents such as butanol and acetone. Acetone production had historic impact during World War I,
when Britain needed a source of acetone to manufacture
gunpowder. Acetone and butanol were produced as fermentation products by Clostridium acetobutylicum, a bacterium identified by the biochemist Chaim Weizmann.
Weizmann was a Russian-born Jew who sought a Jewish
homeland in Palestine. At the end of the war, Weizmann’s
process for acetone production helped

hospitals use rapid and inexpensive biochemical tests
(Chapter 28). A pH indicator added to growth media can
detect the acid produced when a substrate is fermented,
resulting in a color change (Fig. 13.26A). Phenol red is
a pH indicator that is orange-red at neutral pH. It turns
yellow in media acidified by fermentation acids (below pH
6.8) and red at higher pH (above pH 7.4). A culture of Escherichia coli, which ferments quickly, turns phenol red to a
medium yellow after 24 hours. Alcaligenes faecalis, meanwhile, ferments poorly on sugar but converts peptides in
the broth to alkaline amines; this culture turns deep red.
More specific tests depend on the microbe’s ability to
ferment specific sugars. Different species possess different
enzymes able to convert different sugars and sugar derivatives to glucose, which then enters the common fermentation pathway. A well-known example is the use of sorbitol
MacConkey agar to test for E. coli O157:H7, a lethal pathogen contaminating beef and vegetables. The O157:H7
strain of E. coli has a set of virulence genes absent from
nonpathogenic E. coli strains that are present among our
normal colon biota. But the pathogen also happens to
lack genes present in normal E. coli, such as a gene encoding an enzyme to ferment sorbitol. Thus, failure to ferment sorbitol indicates a high probability that the strain is
E. coli O157:H7. On sorbitol MacConkey agar, bacteria
that ferment sorbitol during growth produce acids. The
acidity causes a dye to turn red (the opposite of the phenol red test). Failure to ferment sorbitol (observed as pale
colonies) indicates high probability of E. coli O157:H7
(Fig. 13.26B).

Glucose catabolism is reversible, enabling cells to
build glucose from small molecules.
Fermentation is the completion of catabolism without the electron transport system and a terminal electron acceptor. The electrons from NADH are restored
to pyruvate or its products in reactions that generate
fermentation products, including alcohols and carboxylates, as well as H 2 and CO2. Energy is stored in the form
of ATP.
Fermentation has applications in food, industrial, and
diagnostic microbiology.

13.6

The TCA Cycle and
Aromatic Catabolism

The products of sugar breakdown can be catabolized to
CO2 and H 2O through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA)
cycle. The TCA cycle generates molecules of NADH and
FADH 2, which donate electrons to an electron transport
system (ETS) with a terminal electron acceptor such
as O2 (see Chapter 14). But sugars are not the cycle’s
only substrates. Lignins, phenolics, and even polycyclic
aromatic toxins are degraded to products that enter the
TCA cycle.
The TCA cycle is also known as the Krebs cycle, named
for Hans Krebs (1900–1981), who shared the 1953 Nobel
Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Fritz Lipmann. Krebs

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

and his colleagues at Sheffield University, England, studied
catabolism by observing the oxidizing activities of crude
enzyme preparations from sources such as pigeon breast
muscle, beef liver, and cucumber seeds. In all of these animal and plant tissues, the TCA cycle is conducted by mitochondria, using virtually the same process as their bacterial
ancestors used.

Pyruvate Is Converted to Acetyl-CoA

Glucose catabolism connects with the TCA cycle through
the breakdown of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2. Recall
from Figure 13.14 that acetyl-CoA is also generated from
many other catabolic pathways, including those for breakdown of fatty acids, amino acids, and lignin fragments in
soil. Regardless of its source, acetyl-CoA enters the TCA
cycle by condensing with the four-carbon intermediate
oxaloacetate to form citrate (Fig. 13.27). Citrate undergoes two steps of oxidative decarboxylation, in which CO2
is released and two hydrogens with electrons are transferred to make NADH + H+ or FADH 2. The TCA cycle,
in whole or in part, is found in all microbial species except
for degenerately evolved pathogens that are dependent on
host metabolism, such as Treponema pallidum, the cause of
syphilis (eTopic 13.3).

13.10 If a cell respiring on glucose runs out of oxygen and
other electron acceptors, what happens to the electrons
transferred from the catabolic substrates?

We present first the connecting step between pyruvate
and acetyl-CoA, followed by the details of the TCA cycle.
Bacteria and archaea use at least ten known variations on
the TCA cycle, conducted by diverse species under various
environmental conditions. You will no doubt be relieved to
hear that we present only one: the Krebs pathway, which
is found in most Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, and in most eukaryotes. Other pathways are detailed
in online resources such as the KEGG Pathway Database.
Pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA through removal
of CO2 and transfer of 2e – onto NAD+. The removal of
CO2 and transfer of two electrons is known as oxidative
decarboxylation. The oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate, coupled to CoA incorporation, is performed by an
unusually large multisubunit enzyme called the pyruvate
dehydrogenase complex, or PDC. PDC is a key component of metabolism in bacteria and mitochondria, the first
molecular player to direct sugar catabolism into respiration.
In human mitochondria, defects in PDC affect organs that
have a high metabolic rate, such as heart and brain, causing
myocardial malfunction and heart failure, and neurodegeneration. A structural model for PDC, and the details of its
reaction mechanism, are shown in eTopic 13.4.
The overall reactions catalyzed by PDC are:

enters the TCA cycle.

CH3COCOO – + H+ + HS-CoA →
CH3CO-S-CoA + CO2 + 2H+ + 2e –

The removal of stable CO2 yields energy for the electron
transfer to NADH. The protons dissociated from pyruvate
and from the thiol (SH) of CoA (2H+ in total) are balanced
by the net gain of protons by NADH + H+.
The activity of PDC is increased by high concentrations
of its substrates (CoA and NAD+) and inhibited by its products (acetyl-CoA and NADH). The product acetyl-CoA
may enter one of several pathways. In E. coli, when glucose is plentiful, acetyl-CoA is mostly converted to acetate
via the intermediate acetyl phosphate (Fig. 13.27). Acetyl phosphate is a global signaling molecule that indicates
to the cell the quantity and quality of carbon source available. As glucose decreases, the cell starts to reclaim acetate, converting it back to acetyl-CoA for entry into the
TCA cycle. At the level of gene expression, PDC responds
to environmental conditions. As would be expected, PDC
gene expression is repressed by carbon starvation and by
low levels of oxygen.

CHAPTER 13

Thought Question

13.11 Compare the reactions catalyzed by pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate formate lyase (see Section 13.5). What
conditions favor each reaction, and why?

Acetyl-CoA Enters the TCA Cycle

Recall that acetyl-CoA can participate in various fermentations (see Fig. 13.23). But when a strong terminal electron acceptor is available (such as O2), acetyl-CoA can enter
the TCA cycle to transfer its electrons to electron carriers
(Figs. 13.27 and 13.28). First, the acetyl group condenses
with oxaloacetate, a four-carbon dicarboxylate (double
acid). The condensation forms citrate, a six-carbon tricarboxylate. An advantage of intermediates with two or more
acidic groups is that the concentration of the fully protonated form is extremely low; thus, the molecule is unlikely to
be lost from the cell by diffusion across the membrane, as
are monocarboxylic acids, such as acetate.
Through the rest of the cycle, citrate loses two carbons
as CO2 by a series of reactions that transfer increments of
energy to 3 NADH, 1 FADH 2, and 1 ATP. Each reaction step couples energy-yielding to energy-storing events
(Fig. 13.28).
Step 1. As the acetyl group condenses with oxaloacetate, the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA consumes a molecule of H 2O to restore HS-CoA. The removal of
HS-CoA yields energy to condense acetate with oxaloacetate, forming citrate.
Step 2. Citrate undergoes two rearrangements (with
little energy change) to form isocitrate. Isocitrate
then undergoes oxidative decarboxylation. As we
saw for pyruvate, removal of CO2 yields energy to
transfer 2H+ + 2e – to form NADH + H+, producing
2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate).
Step 3. 2-Oxoglutarate undergoes decarboxylation to
release CO2 and make another NADH + H+. In this
case, CoA is incorporated, making succinyl-CoA.
Step 4. Succinyl-CoA releases CoA, yielding energy
to phosphorylate ADP to ATP. To form fumarate,
2H+ + 2e – are transferred to FAD to form FADH 2 —
a reaction involving negligible free energy change.
FAD is reduced instead of NAD+ because electron
donation from succinyl-CoA does not yield enough
energy to reduce NAD+.
Step 5. Fumarate incorporates water across its double
bond, forming the hydroxy acid malate. The increasing stability from fumarate to malate and from malate
to oxaloacetate yields enough energy to form the final
NADH + H+. Oxaloacetate is the original intermediate
of the cycle, which again accepts the next acetyl-CoA.

ENERGETICS AND CATABOLISM

Note:

Some textbooks state that succinyl-CoA synthetase, the
enzyme catalyzing step 4 in the TCA cycle (Fig. 13.28), phosphorylates GDP to GTP. According to the primary literature, ADP phosphorylation predominates in E. coli (Margaret Birney et al. 1996.
J. Bacteriol. 178:2883), whereas in Pseudomonas species, various
nucleoside diphosphates are phosphorylated (Vinayak Kapatral et
al. 2000. J. Bacteriol. 182:1333). Human mitochondria have two
enzymes, which form ATP and GTP, respectively (David Lambeth
et al. 2004. J. Biol. Chem. 279:36621).

Observing the TCA cycle intermediates. How were all
the TCA intermediates identified? The main experimental
approach available to Krebs and his contemporaries was to
guess at dozens of short-chain acids known to exist in cells,
and then to add each individually to an enzyme preparation and test for TCA cycle activity. In aerobic organisms,
the TCA cycle is tightly tied to respiration, so an increase
in uptake of oxygen signaled a TCA intermediate. A major
experimental advance was the use of tracer isotopes such as
14
C, discovered by Martin Kamen in 1940 (see eTopic 15.1).
Radioisotope tracers answered an important question about the TCA cycle. As the two acetyl carbons cycle
through, which two carbons of each intermediate are
removed as CO2? Which carbons are lost first: the acetyl
carbons or those of the original oxaloacetate? This question was answered by use of substrates radiolabeled with
14
C (highlighted green in Fig. 13.28). In the experiment,
bacteria are fed 14C-radiolabeled acetate, which enters
the TCA cycle. The radiolabeled carbons are captured by
the TCA intermediates and retained into the next cycle,
whereas two COOH carbons from the original oxaloacetate are lost. Thus, the four-carbon intermediate does not
recycle intact, but breaks down and re-forms each time it
passes through the cycle.
Loss of the second CO2 forms succinyl-CoA, which is
converted to succinate. Succinate is a symmetrical molecule;
thus, the former identities of the acetyl and oxaloacetate
moieties are now erased, and the carbons are equally likely
to disappear from either half of the molecule. Further conversion steps regenerate oxaloacetate—half its carbon from

have been released as waste CO2. From the standpoint of the
carbon skeleton, the glucose breakdown is now complete. But
do we have a completed metabolic pathway? No, because all
of the NADH and FADH2 need to be recycled by donating
their electrons onto a terminal electron acceptor.
The process of electron transfer from NADH and
FADH 2 is mediated by the electron transport system (ETS,
discussed in Chapter 14). In the ETS, electrons are transferred from reduced proteins and cofactors to more oxidized
proteins and cofactors, as in the examples in Table 13.4.

Some of the membrane proteins use the energy of electron
transfer to pump protons, generating a gradient of hydrogen ions across the membrane (Fig. 13.29)—a process discussed in detail in Chapter 14.
Assuming a theoretical maximum yield of 3 ATP generated per NADH and 2 ATP per FADH 2, the hydrogen ion
gradient then drives the membrane ATP synthase to synthesize as many as 34 ATP. Another 4 ATP come from glucose breakdown and the TCA cycle (38 total per glucose).
Under actual conditions, however, bacteria make less ATP;

■ Complete oxidation of glucose.
Glucose catabolism generates ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation and
through the electron transport system’s pumping of H+ ions to drive the ATP synthase. The complete oxidative breakdown of glucose to CO2
and H2O could theoretically generate up to 38 ATP. Under actual conditions, the number is smaller.

about 20 ATP per glucose are made by a well-aerated culture of E. coli. Bacterial cells make trade-offs for flexibility,
spending energy to maintain a stable proton potential during extreme changes in external pH and redox levels.
The overall process of electron transport and ATP generation is termed oxidative phosphorylation. The overall
process of oxidative catabolism from substrate breakdown
to oxidative phosphorylation is a form of respiration. The
overall equation for the aerobic respiration of glucose is:

cycle called the glyoxylate bypass (Fig. 13.30A). The glyoxylate bypass allows lung pathogens such as Pseudomonas
aeruginosa and Mycobacterium tuberculosis to catabolize
fatty acids, via their breakdown to acetyl-CoA.
The glyoxylate bypass consists of two enzymes that
divert isocitrate to glyoxylate, and then incorporate a second acetyl-CoA to form malate. The malate can then regenerate oxaloacetate to complete the bypass cycle, donating
2e – to form NADH. The net reaction is:

C6H12O6 + 6H 2O + 6O2 → 12H 2O + 6CO2

2 Acetyl-CoA + oxaloacetate + NAD+ →
succinate + malate + 2 CoA + NADH + H+

Glucose respiration can generate a relatively large number of ATPs per glucose—far more than fermentation can.
In bacteria, however, the actual number of ATP molecules
generated varies widely with availability of carbon source and
oxygen. For example, as oxygen decreases in the environment,
the ability to oxidize NADH decreases, so the cell may make
only 1 or 2 ATP per NADH (discussed in Chapter 14). In
addition, the enzymes of the TCA cycle are regulated extensively by substrate activation and product inhibition, and their
expression is induced by high levels of oxygen and glucose.
Glyoxylate bypass. What happens when glucose is scarce
and cells need carbon both for energy and for biosynthesis?
Bacteria may catabolize lipids instead of glucose, breaking
down the fatty acids into acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle.
But oxygen may be limited, and carbons would be lost as
CO2. Some bacteria can switch to using a modified TCA

Alternatively, malate or oxaloacetate can be diverted into
biosynthesis of glucose (gluconeogenesis)—a pathway that
reverses much of glucose catabolism (see Chapter 15). Most
bacteria need sugar biosynthesis to build their cell walls.
The glyoxylate bypass cuts out all loss of CO2 and electron transfer to energy carriers, with the exception of 1
FADH 2 and possibly 1 NADH from malate to oxaloacetate. Thus, limited energy is released, but two carbons can
be diverted to biosynthesis. Figure 13.30B shows how the
pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis uses the glyoxylate
bypass. A mystery of the disease tuberculosis is the ability
of M. tuberculosis to persist for long periods, growing slowly
within macrophages. What carbon source and metabolism
does the pathogen use? The question was addressed by
labeling infected cells with carbon sources enriched for the
isotope 13C. The intracellular bacteria were then isolated

The TCA cycle for amino acid biosynthesis. Analysis of

pathway evolution indicates that the TCA cycle originally
evolved to provide substrates for building amino acids (see
Chapter 15). For example, the TCA cycle intermediate
2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate) is aminated to form
glutamate, which leads to glutamine. The amine group
comes from nitrogen gas fi xed to ammonium ion (discussed with biosynthesis in Chapter 15). Oxaloacetate is
aminated to form aspartate, entering pathways to purines
and pyrimidines as well. The TCA cycle, like glycolysis,
is an amphibolic pathway that provides substrates for biosynthesis. Many bacteria use the TCA cycle and glycolytic
enzymes to build their sugars and amino acids, as discussed
in Chapter 15. Others, such as Treponema pallidum, the
cause of syphilis, have lost the TCA cycle by reductive evolution. They must obtain amino acids synthesized by their
host organism (see eTopic 13.3).

growth. Thus, key enzymes of the glyoxylate bypass, and
their regulators, offer targets for new antibiotics.

Catabolism of Benzene Derivatives

The TCA cycle plays a key role in the breakdown of aromatic
carbon sources such as the benzene ring. Natural sources of
aromatic carbon include lignin from wood, and polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from petroleum. Aromatic
components of petroleum cause much of the environmental damage during oil spills such as the Deepwater Horizon
spill in 2010. Soil is often polluted by industrial aromatic
compounds, such as nitrate explosives, aniline dyes, and
the solvent toluene. Even the most remote places on Earth,
such as Antarctica, show traces of such pollutants.
To remove aromatic pollutants from water and soil, we
depend on microbial catabolism. Aromatic molecules are
notoriously difficult to catabolize because of the stability of
the benzene ring. The benzene ring breaks down slowly, but
over time, bacteria and fungi catabolize a wide range of aromatic molecules. Figure 13.31 shows an example of research
to study microbial digestion of phenanthrene (a tricyclic
PAH) in the soil of Antarctica. Because the Antarctic Treaty
forbids introduction of exogenous organisms, any bioremediation of pollutants must be accomplished by native microbes.
Uchechukwu Okere and colleagues at Lancaster University sought evidence for phenanthrene biodegradation by
soil microbial communities at Livingston Island, off the
tip of the Antarctic Peninsula. The temperatures at this

appear to be psychrotrophs (cold tolerant) rather than psychrophiles, which require cold for growth. Psychrotrophs
may take advantage of a temporary rise in temperature to
outgrow their competitors.
How do microbes catabolize such tough carbon sources?
As we saw earlier (Fig. 13.14), fungi and bacteria break down
lignin and PAHs to form single-ring aromatic compounds
such as benzoate and phenols. Some of these products have
commercial uses—benzoate is a food preservative; vanillin,
a flavor additive; phenol, an industrial solvent. In nature,
the single-ring compounds are further catabolized to acetyl-CoA, which enters the TCA cycle. Benzoate, activated to
benzoyl-CoA, has a central role in the catabolism of aromatic
molecules, comparable to that of glucose in polysaccharide
catabolism. Bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Rhodococcus
species degrade benzoate and related molecules aerobically or
anaerobically. Anaerobic degradation takes much longer, but
it is critical because the volume of anaerobic habitat (such as
soil) greatly exceeds that of oxygenated habitat.

northernmost end of the continent are moderately cold,
between 3°C in southern summer and –11°C in winter.
Okere incubated soil samples with phenanthrene substrates
containing 14C-radiolabeled carbons. The incubation was
performed in a respirometer with a CO2 trap, and the 14C
radioactivity was measured in the trapped CO2. Okere
found that over 10–30 days, microbes degraded as much as
30% of the phenanthrene to CO2. The degradation rate was
higher at higher temperatures; thus, the catabolic microbes

matic compounds, such as toluene (methylbenzene), chlorobenzoate, and nitrobenzene, can be catabolized via
sequential oxidation steps, requiring the presence of an
ETS that terminates with O2 (Fig. 13.32). Early in the
pathways, enzymes must remove substituents such as chlorides or nitrates. The methyl group of toluene is oxidized
to carboxylate (R–COO –), whose removal then drives a key
breakdown step. Aerobic degradation commonly proceeds
through the intermediate catechol, a benzene ring bearing two adjacent hydroxyl groups. Each benzene derivative is converted to catechol by a specific dioxygenase, an
enzyme that coordinately oxygenates two adjacent ring carbons. Next follows ring cleavage and breakdown to pyruvate (forming NADH) and to acetyl-CoA, which may enter
the TCA cycle and respiration.
The intermediate catechol then undergoes another key
oxidation by a catechol dioxygenase, which adds two more
oxygens while cleaving the ring. In different bacterial species, the enzyme may oxidize catechol at either the 1,2
positions or the 2,3 positions, as shown in Figure 13.32.
Typical products are succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, which
enter the TCA cycle, completing breakdown to CO2. The
details of benzene catabolism vary among bacterial species,
and many diverse mechanisms continue to be discovered.
Anaerobic benzene catabolism. A challenge for biodegradation is that many pollution sources reach deep underground, where the soil is anoxic. Thus, oxygen is unavailable
to conduct the conversions shown in Figure 13.32, particularly the formation of carboxylate (R–COO –) and the
introduction of hydroxyl groups. How can microbes catabolize benzene and benzoate derivatives without oxygen?

Oxidative
catabolism of benzoate and various related compounds proceeds
through catechols. Catechols are degraded through several alternative pathways to the TCA cycle. Steps requiring oxidation are
marked O2. Inset: Bird contaminated by petroleum from an offshore
wellhead.

In early stages of anaerobic catabolism (Fig. 13.33),
benzene and naphthalene incorporate CO2, forming the
carboxylate group of benzoate. Because CO2 is a very weak
oxidant, these reactions require input of energy by hydrolysis of ATP. The carboxylate is then activated by HS-CoA,
forming benzoyl-CoA, the same key intermediate as for
aerobic benzene catabolism.
Anaerobically, the benzoyl-CoA must use reducing
energy from NADH to hydrogenate its ring carbons, thus
breaking the aromaticity. Some bacteria spend ATP as well,
whereas others, such as the iron-reducing bacterium Geobacter metallireducens, can break the ring without spending ATP. The hydroxyl groups that enable shifting of the
double-bond positions are introduced by incorporation of
H 2O. Catabolism continues, forming three acetyl groups

requires high initial investment of reducing energy—one
reason the process operates slowly. For soil bacteria, the
energy invested must come from anaerobic phototrophy or
from anaerobic respiration.
The discovery of effective benzene degraders is of great
interest for bioremediation of sites such as the South Platte
River, north of Denver, where a spill from the Suncor oil
refinery in 2011 released benzene (Fig. 13.34A). To identify novel benzene-degrading microbes, Nidal Abu Laban
and colleagues at the Helmholtz Centre, Munich, performed benzene enrichment culture of soil from a coal
gasification site. From the enrichment culture, the predominant organism was identified as Pelotomaculum species of
clostridia, Gram-positive endospore-forming bacteria. The

gene sequence (for methods, see Chapter 17).
Pelotomaculum bacteria are related to other clostridia
that use the anaerobic electron acceptor sulfate (SO42–). So
Abu Laban hypothesized that sulfate could be used during benzene catabolism. In the experiment whose results
are plotted in Figure 13.34B, 13CO2 was measured by gas
chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS), a technique
that measures molecular masses and can thus distinguish
“heavy isotopes” such as 13C from the more common isotope 12C. When benzene enrichment was performed in the
presence of sulfate, the 13C-labeled benzene showed conversion to 13CO2, while at the same time the sulfate concentration decreased. The autoclaved controls showed no
change in 13CO2 or sulfate concentration. These data are
consistent with anaerobic breakdown of benzene via the
TCA cycle and ETS, with sulfate oxidation.

The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) removes
CO2 from pyruvate, generating acetyl-CoA. PDC activity is a key control point of metabolism, induced when
carbon sources are plentiful, and repressed under carbon
starvation and low oxygen.
The tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) converts the
acetyl group to 2CO2 and 2H 2O in the presence of a
terminal electron acceptor such as O2 to receive the electrons associated with the hydrogen atoms.
Acetyl-CoA enters the TCA cycle by condensing
with oxaloacetate to form citrate. A series of enzymes
sequentially removes carbon dioxide and water molecules and generates 3 NADH, 1 FADH 2, and 1 ATP.
Each reaction step couples energy-yielding to energystoring events.
The glyoxylate bypass provides a way to gain limited
energy from the TCA cycle while avoiding CO2 loss; thus
the bypass diverts intermediates to sugar biosynthesis.
Catabolism of aromatic molecules by bacteria and
fungi recycles lignin and PAHs within ecosystems. Aromatic metabolism is used for bioremediation.
Benzoate undergoes aerobic catabolism to catechol.
The catechol ring is cleaved, generating acetyl-CoA,
which enters the TCA cycle.
Anaerobic catabolism of benzoate involves activation by HS-CoA and reduction by NADH. The energy
for reduction comes from anaerobic respiration or

14.1 Electron Transport Systems

What is so exciting about microbial
electricity?

Geobacter species are ubiquitous in
the environment. They have the ability to transfer electrons located on the
outer cell surface to extracellular electron acceptors such as insoluble metal
oxides and oxidized metals. These
microorganisms can produce electricity by transferring electrons to anodes in microbial fuel cells, thereby earning them
the title of “electric microbes.”
How do you think our assumptions will change about redox
metabolism in environmental microbial communities?
Geobacter can transfer electrons to partner species through
direct electrical connections—a process known as direct
interspecies electron transfer. Interspecies electron transfer in anaerobic environments has paved the way for a thrilling area of research in microbiology. A fuller understanding
of the process and its role in anaerobic environments will
help us devise better strategies for wastewater digestion or
methane emission control in environments such as landfills,
rice paddies, and animal intestinal systems. The potential for
discovery promises an “electrifying” future!

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Electric current in living organisms has fascinated scientists ever since the eighteenth century, when Luigi Galvani
(1737–1798) showed that a voltage caused a dead frog limb
to flex. The idea of biological electricity inspired Mary Shelley’s famous novel Frankenstein: or, the Modern Prometheus,
in which a physician is imagined to “create life” by jolting body parts with an electric shock. Today we know that
electric current flows in all cells. Bacteria such as Geobacter
species (see the Current Research Highlight) can transfer
electrons from an electrode onto hydrogen ions, forming
hydrogen gas. First isolated by Derek Lovley at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, Geobacter can extract
electrons from organic molecules, iron, and even uranium.
In a soil community, Geobacter and other microbes transfer electrons from cell to cell, in a syntrophy that enhances
growth of all the cells involved. For example, Lovley’s students showed how Geobacter metallireducens can form an
“electrical” coculture with Methanosaeta, a methanogen
(Fig. 14.1). The Geobacter cells oxidize ethanol and then
transfer the electrons to the methanogen, which reduces
CO2 to methane. This electrical syntrophy supports digestion in water treatment plants, and it can be a source of
usable electric current.
How do cells make electricity? The energy-yielding reactions we saw in Table 13.1 involve transfer of electrons from
one molecule to another. Much of the energy yield comes

from successive redox steps within an electron transport
system (ETS) of carriers in a membrane, whose energyyielding redox reactions are coupled to transport of ions
such as protons (H+). Types of metabolism that use an ETS
include organotrophy (organic electron donors), lithotrophy (inorganic electron donors), and phototrophy (light
absorption excites electrons). Some bacteria and archaea are
specialists, whereas others use more than one of these types
of metabolism. Even organisms with very different forms of
metabolism show common themes in their mechanisms of
electron transfer. In fact, the protein complexes for processes as different as organotrophy and phototrophy show
homology, indicating that they evolved from a common
ancestral ETS.
Chapter 14 presents electron flow through the ETS in
organotrophy, lithotrophy, and phototrophy. In each step of
the ETS, a molecule becomes “reduced” (gains an electron)
while the molecule donating the electron becomes “oxidized” (loses an electron). In various kinds of metabolism,
some of the energy from electron transfer is stored in the
form of an electrochemical potential (voltage) across a membrane. The potential is composed of the chemical concentration gradient of H+ ions plus the charge difference across the
membrane. The proton potential drives ATP synthesis. Ion
potentials also drive nutrient uptake, mediate pathogenesis
of infective microbes, and shape the chemistry surrounding

they can contribute or remove nitrogen and minerals.

14.1

Electron Transport
Systems

As we learned in Chapter 13, energy to support life is
obtained through reactions that convert substrates to products of lower energy—that is, reactions in which ΔG (free
energy change) is negative. Many reactions involve transfer of
electrons from a reduced electron donor to an oxidized electron acceptor. The simplest path of electron flow is found in
fermentation, where electrons from the fermented substrate,
such as glucose, are transferred onto NAD+ to make NADH
(reduction), and then returned to the glucose breakdown
products. More complex kinds of metabolism, such as aerobic
respiration, transfer electrons through a series of membranesoluble carriers called an electron transport system (ETS),
also known as an electron transport chain (ETC).
Unlike cytoplasmic redox reactions, a membraneembedded ETS can convert its energy into an ion potential or
electrochemical potential between two compartments separated by the membrane. The ion potential is most commonly
a proton (H+) potential, also known as proton motive force
(PMF). The proton motive force drives essential cell processes such as synthesis of ATP (discussed in Section 14.2).

Each ETS finally transfers its electrons to a terminal electron acceptor molecule, whose product may exit the cell.
Metabolism using an ETS is classified based on the
nature of the initial electron donors and terminal electron
acceptors. In this chapter we cover three major classes of
prokaryotic energy acquisition involving an ETS (their relationships are summarized in Table 13.1):
■

Organotrophy (or chemoorganotrophy) is a form of
metabolism in which organic molecules donate electrons. If the electrons are donated to a membraneembedded electron transport system, and ultimately
reduce a terminal electron acceptor, the overall pathway
is called “respiration.” The terminal electron acceptor
may be O2 for aerobic respiration, or an alternative electron acceptor such as nitrate (NO3 –) for anaerobic respiration. Some terminal electron acceptors are organic
(such as fumarate, – O2C–CH= CH–CO2 –).

■

Lithotrophy (or chemoautotrophy) is the oxidation
of inorganic electron donors, such as Fe2+ or H2. The
electron acceptor may be O2 or an anaerobic alternative,
such as NO3 –. A strong electron donor, such as H2, can
use organic electron acceptors such as fumarate. Some
chemoorganotrophs that catabolize many substrates are
“facultative lithotrophs”—for example, oxidizing sulfur
compounds. But many lithotrophs are obligate autotrophs,
fixing CO2 for biosynthesis (discussed in Chapter 15).
These specialist organisms are called chemolithoautotrophs. For example, the bacterium Nitrosomonas europaea obtains nearly all its energy by oxidizing ammonia.

■

Phototrophy involves light capture by chlorophyll, usually
coupled to splitting of H2S or H2O (photolysis). Photoautotrophs couple photolysis to CO2 fixation for forming biomass (discussed in Chapter 15). Photoheterotrophs absorb
light to generate ATP, while incorporating preformed carbon compounds for biosynthesis. Photoheterotrophs may
also capture light energy to supplement catabolism, which
provides electron donors (photoorganotrophy).

Organo-: Organic molecules donate electrons.

Note:

Electron Donors and Acceptors

Different types of metabolism use electron transport systems with different components embedded in the bacterial membrane. For chemotrophy (oxidizing an electron
donor to yield energy), each ETS must accept electrons
from an initial electron donor. The electron donor may
be an organic “food” molecule, such as glucose (organotrophy), or a reduced mineral, such as Fe2+ (lithotrophy).
Next, the ETS proteins and cofactors act sequentially as
electron donors and acceptors, whose oxidation-reduction
reactions are coupled to H+ transport across the membrane.

The term respiration refers to metabolism in which
chemical electron donors yield energy through an ETS. In this book
we reserve the term “respiration” for an ETS with organic electron
donors (organotrophy). The use of inorganic electron donors for
an ETS is called lithotrophy. Other fields use the term “respiration”
differently. In medical physiology, “respiration” refers to catabolism with an ETS, or to the process of carbon dioxide exchange with
oxygen through breathing. In ecology, “respiration” refers to carbon flux in an ecosystem, or throughout the atmosphere.

Energy Storage

determines whether energy can be obtained from a given

reaction of substrates to products. Similar considerations of
ΔG govern the reactions of electron flow through an ETS
and the storage of energy in transmembrane ion gradients.
The reduction potential. To obtain energy, biochemical

reactions require a negative ΔG. In oxidation-reduction
reactions (redox reactions), the ΔG values are proportional
to the reduction potential (E) between the oxidized form
of a molecule (electron acceptor) and its reduced form
(electron donor). The reduction potential represents the
tendency of a compound to accept electrons, measured in
volts (V) or millivolts (mV). A positive value of E has
a negative ΔG, so the gain of electrons yields energy. A
negative value of E means that the reverse reaction (loss of
electrons) yields energy.
The oxidized and reduced states of a compound are
called a redox couple. An example of a redox couple is the
electron acceptor O2 and the electron donor H 2O. Because
O2 is a strong electron acceptor (readily gains 2e –), the
redox couple ½O2 /H 2O has a high positive value of E. So
when O2 plus 2H+ + 2e – forms H 2O, the reaction yields a
large amount of energy.
Standard values of E (E°) are known as the standard reduction potential. The standard reduction potential E°′ assumes a
concentration of 1 M for all components at pH 7. For example,
the value of E°′ for H2 formation from 2H+ + 2e– is –420 mV.
This large negative reduction potential means that it takes

a lot of energy to add the two electrons to 2H+. Thus, the
reverse reaction donating 2e– from H2 to an appropriate electron acceptor yields a lot of energy. An example of microbes
that use this reaction for energy is hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria
growing in oral biofilms, causing gum disease.
Reduction potentials represent a form of the standard
free energy change, ΔG°′. The value of ΔG°′ (in kilojoules
per mole, or kJ/mol) for an electron transfer reaction with
a given reduction potential E°′ is given by
ΔG°′ = –nFE°′
where n is the number of electrons transferred, F is Faraday’s constant (F = 96.5 kJ/V · mol), and E°′ is the reduction potential (V) at 1 M concentration, 25°C, and pH 7.
Thus, E°′ represents the standard reduction potential per
electron, whereas ΔG°′ gives the overall free energy change.
Note that the reaction is favored for positive values of E,
which correspond to negative values of ΔG.
The standard reduction potential E°′ gives the potential
difference between the oxidized and reduced states under
standard conditions, when both oxidized and reduced
forms are at equal concentrations—namely, 1 M. Assuming
equal concentrations at 1 M, we may compare E°′ of various
molecules available in the environment for microbial respiration. Such a comparison generates an “electron tower”
representing the reduction potential E°′ of molecules that
may act as electron acceptors or donors (Table 14.1). The

oxidized state of each redox couple in the table is shown in
red, the reduced state in blue.
A more positive E°′ means that reducing the electron
acceptor yields more energy. A more negative value of E°′ means
that oxidizing the electron donor yields more energy. Either form
of half reaction, in the favored direction, is associated with a negative value of ΔG°′.

In the electron tower, the more negative values of E°′
represent couples (half reactions) with a stronger electron
donor (H 2, NADH), whereas the more positive values represent stronger electron acceptors (O2, NO3 –). For example, in the redox couple NAD+/NADH + H+, the oxidized
form is NAD+ and the reduced form is NADH. The reduction potential is strongly negative (–320 mV), so NADH
is a strong electron donor; that is, the reverse reaction,
NADH + H+ → NAD+, releases a lot of energy (+320 mV).
A complete redox reaction combines two redox couples:
one accepting electrons (red column), the other donating electrons (blue column, arrow reversed). Redox couples with more negative values of E°′ can provide electron
donors (blue column) for electron acceptors with more
positive values of E°′ (red column). The E°′ for the overall
reaction is then given by adding the reversed reaction of the
electron donor E°′ to the electron acceptor E°′. A positive
value of E°′ means that the reaction may proceed to provide energy. For example, the oxidation of NADH by O2
results from combining two couples: O2/H 2O (forward)
and NADH/NAD+ (reversed from Table 14.1). For the
reversed couple, the sign of E°′ changes:

The aerobic oxidation of NADH pairs a strong electron
donor (NADH) with a strong electron acceptor (O2). Thus,
NADH oxidation via the ETS provides the cell with a huge
amount of potential energy (comparable to a 1-V battery
cell) to make ATP and generate ion gradients. NADH is
oxidized by many electron transport systems of bacteria
and archaea, as well as mitochondria. Whenever we digest
food, we make NADH for our mitochondria to oxidize.
Bacteria and archaea have evolved many alternative
donor-acceptor systems; the one they use depends on
what their environment provides. For example in anaerobic marine sediment, the proteobacterium Shewanella can
donate electrons to many alternative oxidized minerals

as terminal electron acceptors, including iron, lead, and
nitrate. How does Shewanella gain access to immobilized
minerals? The bacterium grows “nanowires” to transport
electrons some distance from the cell (Fig. 14.2). The
nanowires develop as a chain of outer membrane vesicles
that lengthen into narrow tubes. A membrane-specific
fluorophore shows that the nanowire is composed of
membrane.
Electron donors can also be oxidized by organic molecules. In the human colon, which lacks molecular oxygen,
Escherichia coli can oxidize NADH by transferring 2e – onto
fumarate, which is reduced to succinate. From Table 14.1,
we find that:
NADH + H+ + fumarate → NAD+ + succinate
E°′ = 320 mV + 33 mV = 353 mV
ΔG°′ = –68 kJ/mol
The fumarate reduction potential is small but yields
some energy for growth. When oxygen reappears in the
environment, the succinate can donate electrons to O2,
forming fumarate and water:
½O2+ succinate → H 2O + fumarate
E°′ = 820 mV – 33 mV = 787 mV
ΔG°′ = –152 kJ/mol

Thought Questions

14.1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a cause of pneumonia in
cystic fibrosis patients, oxidizes NADH with nitrate (NO3–) to
nitrite (NO2–) at neutral pH. What is the value of E°′?
14.2 Could a bacterium obtain energy from succinate as an
electron donor with nitrate (NO3–) as an electron acceptor?

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Concentrations of electron donors and acceptors. A high

concentration of an electron donor can enhance metabolism using reactions with small values of E°′. This is particularly common for lithotrophic reactions such as iron
oxidation. The standard reduction potential E°′ assumes
1 M concentrations of reactants and products at 25°C and
pH 7, but actual values of E within cells depend on actual
reactant concentrations.
In Chapter 13 we saw that ΔG includes a term incorporating the ratio of product concentrations (C and D) to
reactant concentrations (A and B):
[C][D]
ΔG = ΔG°′ + 2.303RT log
[A][B]
where R is the gas constant [8.315 joules per kelvin-mole,
or J/(mol · K)], and T is the temperature in kelvins. The
reduction potential E of a redox reaction depends on the
ratio of products to reactants:

where n is the number of electrons transferred and F is

less potential to do work. At moderate temperatures
(25°C–40°C), the constants in the concentration term
(2.303RT/F) combine to yield approximately 60 mV
per electron when there is a tenfold ratio of products to
reactants. Thus, a tenfold ratio of products to reactants
subtracts about 60 mV from E (decreases energy yield),
whereas a tenfold excess of reactants adds 60 mV to E
(increases energy yield).

An ETS Functions within a Membrane

An electron transport system transfers electrons onto
membrane-embedded carriers in a series of increasing
reduction potential, ending at a terminal electron acceptor such as O2, Fe3+, or NO3 –. Some electron transfer
steps yield energy to pump ions across the membrane. To
store this energy, the ETS must maintain an ion gradient
across a membrane that fully separates two aqueous compartments. In bacteria, the cytoplasmic membrane separates the cytoplasm and external medium. Gram-negative
bacteria such as E. coli have their ETS in the inner (cytoplasmic) membrane, which separates the cytoplasm from
the periplasm (see Chapter 3). The Gram-negative outer
membrane surrounding the periplasm is permeable to
protons and other small molecules; thus, the outer membrane does not store energy. Figure 14.3A shows the
inner membrane of Helicobacter pylori, a Gram-negative
gastric pathogen. The inner membrane contains the ETS

complexes; the cell wall and outer membrane do not participate in respiration.
How do bacteria obtain their electron acceptors? Soluble
electron acceptors such as O2 or NO3 – can reach the cell by
diffusion, but metals such as Fe3+ are stuck within insoluble particles. Metal-reducing bacteria may grow adherent
to particles of iron oxide (recall Geobacter in the Current
Research Highlight). Others secrete organic carrier molecules to dissolve the metal. Still others, such as Shewanella,
form outer membrane nanowire extensions full of extracellular cytochromes. These cytochromes help metal-reducing
bacteria gain access to insoluble minerals—or to the surface
of a fuel-cell electrode (see Special Topic 14.1).
Some respiratory bacteria, such as the nitrite oxidizer
Nitrospira, pack their ETS within intracytoplasmic pockets called “lamellae.” Respiratory membranes similar to
bacterial lamellae are found within our own mitochondria.
Mitochondrial respiration uses only O2 as a terminal electron acceptor. The ETS proteins are embedded in folds of
the mitochondrial inner membrane called “cristae” (singular, crista) (Fig. 14.3B). The inner membrane separates the
inner mitochondrial space from the intermembrane space
(between the inner and outer membranes). The mitochondrial inner membrane, including its electron transport proteins, evolved from the cell membrane of an endosymbiotic
bacterial ancestor. Mitochondrial evolution is discussed
further in Chapter 17.
Electron carrier molecules include proteins and small
organic cofactors bound to the proteins. The protein components of an ETS were first discovered in the 1930s at
Cambridge University by Russian entomologist David Keilin (1887–1963), who studied insect mitochondria. The
mitochondrial inner membranes contain proteins called
cytochromes, which were named for their deep colors,
typically red to brown. The colors derive from absorption
of visible light due to the relatively small energy transitions
of electrons in a cytochrome.
In prokaryotes, cytochromes are often found in the cell
membrane. Figure 14.4 shows the absorbance spectrum
of a cytochrome from the cell membrane of Haloferax volcanii, a halophilic archaeon isolated from the Dead Sea. In
the reduced cytochrome, light absorption peaks in the blue
range (440 nm) and in the orange (607 nm). Upon oxidation, however, the cytochrome loses its absorption peak at
607 nm, and the 440-nm peak shifts to a shorter wavelength. Different species of bacteria make many different
cytochromes, with different absorption peaks, but all cytochromes show spectral changes with a change in reduction
state.
A membrane ETS typically includes several different cytochromes with different reduction potentials. Keilin proposed
that the cytochromes pass electrons sequentially from each
protein complex to the next-stronger electron acceptor, with

each step providing a small amount of energy to the organism (Fig. 14.5). The electron transport proteins are called
oxidoreductases because they oxidize one substrate (removing electrons) and reduce another (donating electrons). Thus,
they couple different half reactions in the electron tower (see
Table 14.1). Oxidoreductases consist of multiprotein complexes that include cytochromes as well as noncytochrome
proteins. The structure and function of ETS oxidoreductase
complexes are discussed in Section 14.3.

The Proton Motive Force

The sequential transfer of electrons from one ETS protein to the next yields energy to pump ions (in most cases
H+) across the membrane. Proton pumping generates a proton motive force (or proton potential) composed of the H+
concentration difference plus the charge difference across the
membrane. The proton motive force (PMF, or Δp) drives many
different cellular processes, such as ATP synthesis and flagellar rotation. In pathogens, the PMF drives drug efflux pumps
that confer resistance to antibiotics such as tetracycline.
Note that in water, H+ never occurs as such, because it
combines with a water molecule to form hydronium ion,
H3O+. Current data, however, are consistent with the
passage of hydrogen nuclei (protons) through the proton pumps of the electron transport system. Within the
pump complex, the proton associates with one chemical
group after another; for example, H+ may combine with
the amine of an amino acid (RNH 2) to form an ammonium ion (RNH3+), and then transfer to a different protonaccepting group within the protein.

Note:

In this book we use “hydrogen ions” and “H+” interchangeably with “protons.”

they did not know how. Most were convinced that electron transport was somehow directly coupled to ATP synthesis. The actual means of coupling was proposed and
demonstrated by one of Keilin’s students—Peter Mitchell
(1920–1992)—and Mitchell’s colleague Jennifer Moyle
(Fig. 14.6A). In 1961, Mitchell proposed an astonishing
explanation for the coupling of electron transport to ATP
synthesis. The chemiosmotic theory states that the energy
from electron transfer between membrane proteins is used
to pump protons across the membrane, accumulating a
higher H+ concentration in the compartment outside. The
pump generates the proton motive force Δp, which stores
energy that can be used to make ATP (Fig. 14.6B).

CHAPTER 14

ELECTRON FLOW IN ORGANOTROPHY, LITHOTROPHY, AND PHOTOTROPHY

Other biologists questioned how a proton potential
could be coupled to ATP synthesis at an enzyme complex
separate from the ETS, at a distant location on the mem-brane. They were skeptical that the H+ concentration gra-dient and charge difference could exist everywhere on thee
membrane separating the two compartments. Because thee
membrane is impermeable to hydrogen ions, the H+ cur-rent can flow back only through a proton-driven complexx
such as the membrane ATP synthase (discussed further in
n
Section 14.3). In effect, the proton potential is a “proton
n
battery,” analogous to the electron potential of an electri-cal battery.
The chemiosmotic theory proved so controversial thatt
Mitchell left Cambridge University to found his own laboratory, Glynn House, where Moyle joined him to test it. A
key requirement was to show that the ETS generates a proton potential. Moyle’s experiment showed that respiration
of mitochondria is associated with proton efflux: Mitochondria isolated from rat livers were exposed to oxygen,
causing efflux of hydrogen ions. The H+ efflux occurred
as electrons were transferred across the ETS and hydrogen ions were expelled by the proton pumps. In Moyle’ss
n
experiments, the number of protons extruded per electron
transferred down the ETS was consistent with the chemi-osmotic model. Similar results were obtained with vesicless
m
made first from mitochondrial membranes and later from
the membranes of chloroplasts and bacteria.
n
A greater challenge was to demonstrate that a proton
d
motive force could, in fact, drive the ATP synthase and
other ion transporters without any undiscovered interme-diate. A friend of Mitchell and Moyle, André Jagendorf, att
Johns Hopkins University, tested the effect of a proton gradient imposed on spinach chloroplasts (Fig. 14.7A). Chloroplasts contain ATP synthase directed outward (that is,
driven by proton flow from inside to outside). The chloroplasts were partly opened by osmotic shock, and then
suspended in medium containing concentrated hydrogen
ions (pH 4). With the osmotic balance restored, the chloroplast membranes closed again, with increased [H+] trapped
inside. When the pH outside was raised to pH 8.3—that
is, lower [H+]—protons from the acidic interior of the vesicles flowed out through the ATP synthase, and ADP and
inorganic phosphate were converted to ATP. Jagendorf
interpreted this result as consistent with the chemiosmotic
theory for the mechanism of phosphorylation.
Other researchers showed that ATP synthesis could be
driven by a charge difference across a vesicle membrane
(Fig. 14.7B). An artificial electrical potential (Δψ) was
applied by loading vesicles with potassium ions (K+). The
potassium ions were conducted across the membrane by
the ionophore valinomycin, a small cyclic peptide that
binds to an ion and solubilizes it in the membrane. Valinomycin specifically binds K+, while its hydrophobic side

conducts K+ across the membrane down its concentration gradient. In the experiment shown, the vesicles are
“inside-out” bacterial membrane vesicles, in which the
ATP synthase points outward instead of inward. The K+

ATP synthase, catalyzing formation of ATP. Thus, Δψ
drives formation of ATP.

For cells grown at neutral pH, all three
terms (Δp, Δψ, and –60ΔpH) usually
have a negative value, meaning that their
force drives protons inward from outside.
In living cells, the relative contributions of Δψ and –60ΔpH vary depending on other sources of charge difference
and protons, as shown in Figure 14.8.
Both the Δψ and ΔpH components of Δp
are influenced by other factors besides
ETS proton transport. For example:
■

■ Electrical potential and pH difference. Proton motive force drives
protons into the cell (arrow). A. The proton motive force Δp is composed of the transmembrane electrical potential Δψ (the charge difference), plus the transmembrane pH difference
ΔpH (the chemical concentration gradient of H+). B. If the pH inside and outside the cell is
equal, then Δp = Δψ. C. If the electrical charge inside and out is equal, then Δp = –60ΔpH.

Δ p Includes Δψ and ΔpH

The transfer of H+ through a proton pump generates a H+
concentration difference across the membrane. Since H+ carries a positive charge, the proton transfer also generates a
charge difference across the membrane. The H+ concentration difference (ΔpH) plus the charge difference (Δψ) make
a proton potential (Δp), also called a proton motive force
(PMF).
Thus, when protons are pumped across the membrane,
the proton motive force stores energy in two different
forms—the separation of charge, or electrical potential,
and the gradient of H+ concentration, or pH difference—
as shown in Figure 14.7. Either form (or both) can drive
Δp-dependent cell processes:
■

■

The electrical potential (Δψ) arises from the separation
of charge between the cytoplasm (more negative) and
the solution outside the cell membrane (more positive).
For many bacteria, this “battery” potential is about –50
to –150 mV.
The pH difference (ΔpH) is the difference between
internal and external pH [pH(in) – pH(out)]. For example, if the bacterial internal pH is 7.5 and the external pH
is 6.5, the ΔpH is 1.0, and the ratio of [H+]out to [H+]in
is 10. A ΔpH of 1.0 corresponds to a proton potential of
approximately –60 mV when the temperature is 25°C.

The relationship between electrical and chemical components of the proton potential Δp (in mV) is given by:
Δp = Δψ – (2.3RT/F)ΔpH
or approximately:
Δp = Δψ – 60ΔpH

The charge difference Δψ includes
charges on other ions, such as K+
and Na+. These ions are pumped or
exchanged by ion-specific membrane
transport proteins.

The pH difference ΔpH is affected by
metabolic generation of acids, such as
fermentation acids, or by pH changes
outside the cell. Permeant acids can run down the gradient
through the membrane, collapsing the ΔpH to zero.
■

Overall, the cell uses its various membrane pumps and
metabolic pathways to adjust and maintain its proton
motive force at a size sufficient to drive ATP synthesis but
not so great as to disrupt the membrane.

Thought Questions

14.3 What do you think happens to Δψ as the cell’s external
pH increases or decreases? What could happen to the Δp of
bacteria that are swallowed and enter the extremely acidic
stomach?

14.4 How could a simple experiment provide evidence that

a proton pump in the bacterial cell membrane drives efflux of
antibiotics such as tetracycline?

What about other ions, such as the sodium ions in Figure 14.8? Can a sodium gradient drive cell processes? For
some bacteria, a gradient of Na+ concentration can drive
transport of a nutrient through a transporter protein embedded in the cell membrane. Bacteria such as Vibrio cholerae
(the cause of cholera) can use a Na+ concentration gradient
to power ATP synthesis by a Na+-dependent ATP synthase.
Dissipation of proton motive force. What happens if something disrupts the membrane so that protons leak through?
Even a small leak can quickly dissipate all the energy stored
as ΔpH.
Many fermentation products are weak acids, such as acetic
acid, whose protonated form can dissolve in the membrane and

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

The Respiratory ETS
and ATP Synthase

We now discuss the carrier molecules and proteins that
comprise the electron transport system (ETS) of oxidative
respiration. For aerobic bacteria, and for the mitochondrial
inner membrane, the respiratory ETS receives electrons
from NADH and FADH 2 and transfers electrons ultimately to O2, producing H 2O. In between, the series of
membrane-embedded carriers harvests the reducing potential of electrons in small steps.

ETS proteins such as cytochromes associate electron transfer with small, reversible energy transitions. The energy
transitions are mediated by cofactors, small molecules that
associate with the protein. Figure 14.11 shows the protein
structure of a cytochrome from the pathogen Pseudomonas
aeruginosa. The protein, cytochrome c, transfers electrons
for nitrate respiration. Its reddish color derives from the
buried cofactor called heme, a ring of conjugated double
bonds surrounding an iron ion (Fe2+ or Fe3+). The heme
plays a key role in acquiring and transferring electrons,
with an Fe2+/Fe3+ transition. A metal-reducing bacterium
such as Geobacter may make over a hundred different types
of cytochromes in its envelope, where electrons accumulate
until the bacterium finds an oxidant to accept them.

Cofactors such as heme allow small, reversible redox
changes. Other examples include flavin mononucleotide
(FMN) and ubiquinone (Fig. 14.12). The structure of
each cofactor must allow transition of an electron between
closely spaced energy levels to avoid “spending it all in one
place.” If all of the energy were spent in one transition,
most of it would be lost as heat instead of being converted
to several small processes, such as pumping H+ across the
membrane.
Small energy transitions typically involve these kinds of
molecular structures:

■

Metal ions such as iron or copper, coordinated (and
hence held in place) with amino acid residues. Iron is

often coordinated by sulfur atoms of cysteine residues
in the protein; examples shown in Figure 14.12B are
[2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S]. Transition metals make useful
electron carriers because their outer electron shell has
several closely spaced energy levels, facilitating small
energy transitions.
■

Conjugated double bonds and heteroaromatic rings,
such as the nicotinamide ring of NAD+/NADH, also
provide narrowly spaced energy transitions. Membranesoluble carriers such as quinones (reduced to quinols)
allow even smaller energy transitions than does NAD+/
NADH.

The major protein complexes of electron transport
each have one or more redox centers containing either
metal ions or conjugated double bonds or both. In FMN,
the conjugated double bonds allow a small energy transition (Fig. 14.12A). In iron-sulfur clusters—[2Fe-2S] and
[4Fe-4S]—the metal atoms provide the site for a small
energy transition, its size dependent on the cluster’s connections within the associated protein (Fig. 14.12B). The
heme group found in cytochromes and other oxidoreductases contains extensive conjugated double bonds, coordinated around the metal Fe3+ (Fig. 14.12C). Reduction
by a transferred electron converts the iron to Fe2+. The
branching of side chains on the ring varies among different
hemes, altering the magnitude of E°′ for the redox couple
Fe3+/Fe2+.
Some electron carriers are small molecules that associate loosely with a protein complex and then come off to
diffuse freely within the membrane. Mobile electron carriers include quinones such as ubiquinone (Fig. 14.12D),
which can be reduced to quinols:
Q + 2H+ + 2e – → QH 2
Quinols carry electrons and protons laterally within the
membrane between the proton-pumping protein complexes
of the ETS. The hydrophobic quinols never leave the membrane; thus their electrons are kept in the membrane until
transfer out of the ETS. After transferring their electrons
to the next protein complex, quinols revert to quinones,
capable of accepting electrons again.

Note:

Dehydrogenases, reductases, and oxidases are all oxidoreductases, which oxidize one substrate (remove electrons) and
reduce another (donate electrons). Oxidoreductases that accept
electrons from NADH or FADH2 are also called dehydrogenases,
because their reaction releases hydrogen ions.

Oxidoreductase Protein Complexes

A respiratory electron transport system includes at least three
functional components: an initial substrate oxidoreductase

(or dehydrogenase), a mobile electron carrier, and a terminal oxidase. Microbes make alternative versions of each
component using alternative electron-donating substrates
and terminal electron acceptors, depending on what is
available in the environment. Here we present a typical bacterial ETS receiving electrons from NADH and transferring them to oxygen.
Initial substrate oxidoreductase. A respiratory ETS begins
with an initial oxidoreductase that receives a pair of electrons from an organic substrate such as NADH. Note
that NADH forms by receiving two electrons plus 2H+
from an organic product of catabolism (designated RH 2)
(Fig. 14.13A). The 2H+ are ultimately balanced by 2H+
from the cytoplasm combining with O2 (or another terminal electron acceptor) at the end of the ETS. The two
electrons (2e –) from NADH enter an ETS protein complex
embedded in the membrane.
NADH donates electrons to NADH dehydrogenase
(NADH:quinone oxidoreductase, NDH-1) (Fig. 14.13A).
In bacteria, the NDH-1 complex includes 14 different subunits. The NDH-1 complex includes the cofactor FMN,
as well as several iron-sulfur clusters—typically 7[4Fe-4S]
and 2[2Fe-2S]. The cofactors “hand off” electrons to each
other through adjacent connections; see, for example, the
placement of FMN and the first [4Fe-4S] within the peptide coils of NDH-1 (Fig. 14.13B). Each electron from
NADH travels through FMN and the iron-sulfur series.
At the end of the chain, the electrons and 2H+ from solution are transferred to a quinone, which is thus reduced to
a quinol. Quinones are designated Q; and quinols, QH 2.
Within the NDH-1 complex, the oxidation of NADH
and reduction of Q to QH 2 yields energy to pump up to
4H+ across the membrane. A crystallographic model shows
four apparent proton channels through transmembrane
alpha helices of the protein subunits (Fig. 14.13A). Within
each channel, a hydrogen ion hops along a series of amino
acid residues. The H+ translocation is driven by a conformational change in the alpha helices throughout the protein,
arising from the initial two-electron reduction by NADH.
The hydrogen ions pumped across the membrane contribute to the proton potential Δp. In human mitochondria,
the NADH dehydrogenase (aka “complex I”) is critical for
health; genetic defects in complex I are associated with diseases such as Parkinson’s and some forms of diabetes.
Note that the 4H+ pumped across the membrane are distinct from the 2H+ acquired by the quinone (Q → QH 2).
In some halophilic bacteria, 4Na+ are pumped instead
of 4H+.

Note:

In our figures, protons that cross the membrane by the
end of the ETS (and thus contribute to Δp) are highlighted yellow.

quinone can receive
2e – from the substrate oxidoreductase,
Q H2
along with 2H+ from solution, to balance
the negative charges, yielding a quinol
(Fig. 14.13A). The quinols diffuse within
the membrane and carry reduction energy to
other ETS components. After transferring
2e – to the next protein complex, 2H+ are
released. Usually the 2H+ released are on the
opposite side of the membrane from where
2H+ were originally picked up (Fig. 14.14).
Thus, besides electron transfer, a quinol may
contribute two protons to the transmembrane proton potential. The reoxidized carriers then recycle back as quinones.
Each quinone can bind to a substrate
dehydrogenase, pick up a pair of electrons and
hydrogen ions, and then diffuse away and carry the electrons to a reductase. The quinones and quinols, referred to
as the quinone pool, diffuse freely within the membrane.
Thus, the quinones/quinols are able to transfer electrons
between many different redox enzymes.
Different oxidoreductase complexes interact with slightly
different quinones, such as ubiquinone and menaquinone.
The reduction potentials of ubiquinone and menaquinone
are given in Table 14.1. For clarity, this chapter refers to
all of them as quinones (Q), and their reduced forms as
quinols (QH 2).

Not all substrate oxidoreductases pump protons. For
example, E. coli has an alternative NADH dehydrogenase
(NDH-2) that transfers two electrons to Q without pumping additional protons across the membrane. (The unused
energy is lost as heat.) NDH-2 functions during rapid
growth, when the cell must limit its proton potential to
avoid membrane breakdown. Other complexes, such as succinate dehydrogenase, transfer electrons from substrates

trons from a quinol (QH 2) and transfers them to a terminal
electron acceptor, such as O2 (Fig. 14.14). The complex
usually includes a cytochrome that accepts electrons from
quinols. Cytochromes of comparable function are designated by letters—for example, cytochrome b (E. coli and
mitochondria) and cytochrome c (mitochondria). The cytochrome is bound to an oxidase complex containing a series
of electron-transferring carriers: two iron-centered hemes
and three copper atoms. This unique center couples electron transfer and proton pumping.
The E. coli cytochrome bo quinol oxidase consists of cytochrome b plus oxidase complex o. The cytochrome b subunit
receives two electrons from a quinol (QH2 → Q) and releases
the 2H+ out to the periplasm. Each electron from quinol travels through the two hemes of the oxidase complex. Because
the two quinol hydrogens originated from 2H+ in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 14.13) and 2H+ were released outside by a
quinol, there is net efflux of 2H+. In addition, the transfer of
2e – between the two oxidase hemes is coupled to pumping
2H+ from the cytoplasm across to the periplasm (Fig. 14.14).

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

at least three phases of electron transfer, such as: (1) NADH
from an organic substrate donates electrons to an initial oxidoreductase; (2) the electrons are transferred to a quinone,
which is reduced to a quinol; (3) the quinol transfers electrons
to a terminal oxidase and releases 2H+ outside the cell. Both
enzymes and quinones show considerable complexity and
diversity among different species in different environments.
The entering carrier NADH carries two electrons with
protons obtained from catabolized food molecules. The two
electrons (2e –) from NDH-1 and two protons (2H+) from
solution are transferred onto Q (quinone), converting it to
QH 2 (quinol). The transfer of 2e – from NADH yields sufficient energy to pump as many as 4H+ across the membrane.
The exact number depends on cell conditions, such as the
concentrations of NADH and the terminal electron acceptor.
The QH 2 diffuses within the membrane until it reaches
a terminal oxidase complex, such as the cytochrome bo
quinol oxidase. The 2H+ from QH 2 are released outside
the cell, while the 2e – enter the oxidase, reducing the two
hemes. The two electrons join 2H+ from the cytoplasm,
combining with an oxygen atom to make H 2O. The reaction is coupled to pumping of 2H+ across the membrane
plus a net increase of 2H+ outside through redox reactions.
Overall, the oxidation of NADH exports about 8H+ per
–
2e transferred through the ETS to make H 2O. The export
of protons generates a proton potential Δp.

Note:

Protons (hydrogen ions, H+) can have three different
fates in the ETS:
1. Protons are pumped across the membrane (H+) by an oxidoreductase complex. Contributes to Δp.
2. Protons are consumed from the cytoplasm by quinone/quinol,
while other protons are released outside the membrane (H+).
Contributes to Δp.
3. Protons are consumed by combining with the terminal electron
acceptor (O2). If the loss balances protons released by catabolism, it does not affect Δp.

Thought Questions

14.6 In Figure 14.15, what is the advantage of the oxidore-

ductase transferring electrons to a pool of mobile quinones,
which then reduce the terminal reductase (cytochrome
complex)? Why does each oxidoreductase not interact directly
with a cytochrome complex?

14.7 In Figure 14.15, why are most electron transport proteins fixed within the cell membrane? What would happen if
they “got loose” in aqueous solution?

Environmental modulation of the ETS. The ETS just

described represents optimal conditions, when food and
oxygen are unlimited. What happens when food (that is,

electron donors) or oxygen is scarce? When the environment changes, bacteria adjust the efficiency of their ETS by
expressing alternative oxidoreductases. For example, at low
concentrations of oxygen (microaerophilic conditions, discussed in Chapter 5) the reduction potential E is decreased.
So the ETS may be unable to reduce O2 to H 2O while
pumping four protons. Instead, E. coli uses a different cytochrome quinol oxidase that has higher affi nity for oxygen
but pumps fewer protons. Thus, the bacteria will gain less
energy, but they will still be able to grow. Environmental
regulation of ETS is discussed further in eTopic 14.1.
Bacteria also have alternative oxidoreductases to serve
different electron donors and acceptors. Some enzymes take
electrons from donors lacking the potential of NADH; for
example, succinate dehydrogenase catalyzes the one step
of the TCA cycle that yields FADH 2 —a step that provides
not quite enough energy to produce NADH (discussed
in Chapter 13). Succinate dehydrogenase is the only TCA
enzyme embedded in the membrane as an ETS component. When O2 concentration is so low as to be thermodynamically unavailable, some bacteria can use other electron
acceptors, such as nitrate (anaerobic respiration, discussed in
Section 14.4). Yet another alternative is to oxidize inorganic
electron donors (lithotrophy, discussed in Section 14.5).
Mitochondrial respiration. In contrast to E. coli, mito-

chondria have only a single ETS, optimized for a relatively
uniform intracellular environment (Fig. 14.16). Protected
by the eukaryotic cytoplasm, mitochondria do not need to
use alternative versions of their ETS to respire under different conditions. Instead, a set of just four electron-carrying
complexes has evolved so as to maximize the energy
obtained from NADH, minimizing energy lost as heat.
This mitochondrial ETS is nearly universal throughout
the cells of animals, plants, and most eukaryotic microbes.
In addition, some bacteria, such as Paracoccus denitrificans, have an ETS whose organization resembles that of
mitochondria.
The mitochondrial ETS has homologs (proteins encoded
by genes with a common ancestor) of bacterial ETS components, including NADH dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, and cytochrome c oxidase. However, the mitochondrial
ETS differs from that of E. coli in these respects:
■

An intermediate cytochrome oxidase complex
transfers electrons. Besides NADH dehydrogenase

The Proton Potential
Drives ATP Synthase

The proton potential drives synthesis of ATP by the membrane ATP synthase, also known as the F1Fo ATP synthase. The proton-driven synthesis of ATP completes the
cycle of oxidative phosphorylation, in which hydrogen
ions pumped by the ETS drive phosphorylation of ADP to
ATP by the ATP synthase. The same ATP synthase can
use the proton potential generated by lithotrophy (see
Section 14.5) or by phototrophy (Section 14.6). Surprisingly, despite the homology of ATP synthase across all
forms of life, the complex is a target for antibiotics. For
example, the ATP synthase of Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
the cause of tuberculosis, is inhibited specifically by bedaquiline, an antibiotic approved in 2012 for patients whose
disease resists all other drugs.
The F1Fo ATP synthase is a protein complex highly conserved in the bacterial cell membrane, the mitochondrial
inner membrane, and the chloroplast thylakoid membrane.
An elegant molecular machine, the ATP synthase is composed of two complexes—Fo and F1—that rotate relative

plus a beta subunit) interconverts ADP + Pi with ATP +
H 2O. The gamma subunit connects the tripartite “knob”
of F1 to the membrane-embedded Fo. Proton transport
through Fo drives ATP synthesis by F1.
One proton at a time enters the subunit-a channel and
moves into a c subunit of Fo (Fig. 14.18 ). The proton potential directed inward ensures that protons more
often enter from the outside than from the cytoplasm.
Each entering proton causes a c subunit to rotate around
the axle, with release of a bound proton to the cytoplasm.
The flux of three protons through Fo is coupled to forming
one molecule of ATP by one alpha-beta-gamma unit of F1.
During each cycle generating ATP, the ring of c subunits of
the Fo rotor rotates in the membrane one-third of one turn
relative to the F1 in the cytoplasm.
Note that the generation of ATP is completely reversible, so ATP hydrolysis by F1 can pump protons back
through Fo across the membrane. In the absence of a proton potential, a high ATP concentration can drive the Fo in
reverse, actually pumping protons to generate Δp. This
reversal of ATP synthase is used, for example, by Enterococcus faecalis, intestinal Gram-positive cocci that generate
ATP mainly by fermentation. E. faecalis can operate the

membrane-embedded F1Fo ATP synthase in reverse, consuming ATP and thus generating a proton potential for
nutrient uptake and ion transport.

Thought Question

14.8 Would E. coli be able to grow in the presence of an

uncoupler that eliminates the proton potential supporting ATP
synthesis?

Na+ Pumps: An Alternative to H+ Pumps

While a proton potential provides primary energy storage for
most species, some bacteria generate an additional potential
of sodium ions. A sodium motive force (ΔNa+) is analogous
to the proton motive force in that it includes the electrical potential Δψ plus the sodium ion concentration gradient (log ratio of the Na+ concentration difference across the
membrane). For extreme halophilic archaea, which grow in
concentrated NaCl, the sodium potential entirely substitutes for the proton potential to drive ATP synthesis. These
“haloarchaea” make use of the high external Na+ concentration to store energy in the form of a sodium potential.

CHAPTER 14

■

ELECTRON FLOW IN ORGANOTROPHY, LITHOTROPHY, AND PHOTOTROPHY

In some bacteria, an ETS oxidoreductase pumps Na+
instead of H+. For example, the proton-pumping NADH
dehydrogenase can be supplemented by an NADH dehydrogenase that pumps Na+ out of the cell. This primary
sodium pump is found in many pathogens, including
Vibrio cholerae (the cause of cholera) and Yersinia pestis
(the cause of bubonic plague). These pathogens use the
sodium-rich blood plasma to store energy in a sodium
potential.

Protons are consumed by combining with the terminal electron acceptor, such as combining with oxygen to

The proton potential drives ATP synthesis through
the membrane-embedded F1Fo ATP synthase. Three

of ATP. Some bacteria use a similar ATP synthase driven

Anaerobic Respiration

called obligate aerobes because they grow only using O2 as

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

(see Table 14.1). In a given environment, bacteria use the
strongest electron donor and the strongest electron acceptor
available. The best donor and best acceptor usually induce
the expression of genes encoding their respective redox
enzymes. For example, in the presence of nitrate, genes
encoding nitrate reductase are expressed. At the same time,
nitrate represses the expression of reductases for poorer electron acceptors, such as fumarate. (The mechanisms of gene
induction and repression are discussed in Chapter 10.)

Oxidized Forms of Nitrogen

Respiration using oxidized forms of nitrogen is widespread among bacteria and archaea. Most eukaryotes must
breathe oxygen, but some eukaryotic microbes respire on
nitrate and nitrite. In anaerobic soil, many yeasts and filamentous fungi can reduce nitrate to nitrite, and nitrite to
nitrous oxide.
The nitrogen series offers an abundant source of strong
electron acceptors. Reduction of oxidized states of nitrogen
for energy yield is called dissimilatory denitrification. Dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA) contributes to respiration, whereas assimilatory reduction of nitrate
generates ammonium ion for fixation into biomass (discussed
in Chapters 15 and 22). Some pathogens are dissimilatory
denitrifiers, such as Neisseria meningitidis (a cause of meningitis) and Brucella species that cause brucellosis in cattle,
sheep, and dogs. In the dissimilatory nitrogen redox series,
a given oxidation state can serve as an acceptor in one redox
couple but as a donor in the next. The redox couples are summarized here:

Each nitrogen state requires a specialized reductase, such
as nitrate reductase or nitrite reductase, to receive electrons from the ETS. During the reactions, oxygen atoms
are removed and combined with protons to form water.
The full series of nitrate reduction to N2 plays a crucial role
in producing the nitrogen gas of Earth’s atmosphere (discussed in Chapter 22).
An alternative option for many soil bacteria, such as
Bacillus species, is to reduce nitrite to ammonium ion
(NH4+):
NO2 – + 8H+ + 6e – → NH4+ + 2H 2O
Dissimilatory nitrate and nitrite reduction to ammonium
ion can increase the soil pH. The high pH will precipitate
metals such as iron.
The presence of a particular reductase can be used as
a diagnostic indicator for clinical isolates of bacteria. For

example, the chemical test for nitrate reduction is a key
step in the diagnosis of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative
agent of gonorrhea. N. gonorrhoeae happens to lack the terminal reductase for nitrate; hence, it tests negative, whereas
several closely related species test positive.

Oxidized Forms of Sulfur

The redox potentials for sulfur oxyanions are generally lower
than those for oxidized nitrogen. Nevertheless, with the
appropriate oxidoreductases, sulfate and sulfite receive electrons from many kinds of electron donors, including acetate, hydrocarbons, and H 2. Sulfate-reducing bacteria and
archaea are widespread in the ocean, from the Arctic waters
to submarine thermal vents. The ubiquity of sulfate reduction may be related to the high sulfate content of seawater,
in which SO42– is the most common anion after chloride.
The major oxidized forms of sulfur that serve as bacterial electron acceptors include:

A surprising use of a sulfur oxyanion by a pathogen is tetrathionate respiration by Salmonella enterica (Fig. 14.20).
When S. enterica infects the gut epithelium, it induces host
inflammation and activates white blood cells (discussed in
Chapter 25). Salmonella catabolizes amino acids, releasing hydrogen sulfide (H 2S), which becomes oxidized to
thiosulfate (S2O32–). White blood cells called neutrophils
attempt to kill the bacteria by secreting toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), or oxidants. The ROS convert thiosulfate to tetrathionate (S 4O62–). But, surprisingly, S. enterica
can use tetrathionate as a terminal electron acceptor for its
ETS to yield energy. With this extra energy source unavailable to competitors, the pathogenic S. enterica can outgrow
the host’s native microbiome and cause disease.

Dissimilatory Metal Reduction

An important class of anaerobic respiration involves the
reduction of metal cations, or dissimilatory metal reduction. The term “dissimilatory” indicates that the metal
reduced as a terminal electron acceptor is excluded from the
cell. This is in contrast to minerals reduced for the purpose
of incorporation into cell components (assimilatory metal
reduction). Metal-reducing bacteria such as Geobacter or
Shewanella offer the intriguing prospect of making electricity in a fuel cell (Special Topic 14.1). The metals most
commonly reduced through anaerobic respiration are iron
(Fe3+ → Fe2+) and manganese (Mn4+ → Mn2+), but virtually any metal with multiple redox states can be reduced

such as those of Shewanella (seen earlier, in Fig. 14.2).

or oxidized by some bacteria. For example, Geobacter can
reduce uranium (U6+ → U4+) to respire on acetate. Reduced
uranium is insoluble in water, precipitating as uranite (UO2).
Thus, Geobacter respiration with uranium can remediate uranium-contaminated water. The U.S. Department of
Energy used uranium-reducing bacteria for remediation at
Rifle, Colorado, where uranium contamination threatened
the Colorado River. In this process, acetate is pumped into
the water table, where G. metallireducens oxidizes the acetate
to CO2 by reducing U6+ to U4+. The reduced uranium then
precipitates out of the water into the soil, where it can be collected and removed, while the cleansed water flows through.
Metal electron acceptors require a specific oxidoreductase
(or reductase). Metal ions in solution interact directly with
reductases, but oxidized metals such as Fe3+ are often barely
soluble in water. How does a bacterial reductase interact with
an insoluble source of metal outside the cell? Soil bacteria
may “shuttle” electrons to extracellular metals using quinone-like degradation products of lignin, a complex aromatic
substance that forms the bulk of wood and woody stems. Lignin degradation products are also called “humics” because
of their presence in humus, the organic components of soil
(discussed in Chapter 21). Humics accumulate in anaerobic
environments, where decomposition is slow. Alternatively,
bacteria may contact insoluble metals using surface-bound

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

SPECIAL TOPIC 14.1(( Bacterial Electric Power
In natural biofilms, bacteria transfer electrons to metals and
even between neighboring bacteria. What if we could harness bacterial electron transfer to power our own electrical
devices? Kenneth Nealson (Fig. 1A) and students at the University of Southern California are trying to do just that.
The concept of bacterial electric power is surprisingly
recent. Up to 20 years ago, it was thought that bacteria could
reduce only soluble ions such as nitrate. But Nealson, like the
famous nineteenth-century microbial ecologist Sergei Winogradsky, was fascinated by the metal transformations he
observed in wetlands and lake sediments. Nealson was particularly intrigued by the high levels of reduced manganese (Mn2+)
found in Lake Oneida, New York. He reasoned that only microbial activity could account for so much reduced manganese,
compared to other lakes where manganese is in the oxidized
form (Mn4+, as the insoluble mineral MnO2). In 1988, Nealson
and his colleague Charles Myers discovered a bacterium that
could respire anaerobically by donating electrons to MnO2,
releasing soluble Mn2+. The bacterium, named Shewanella
oneidensis MR-1 (for “manganese reducer”) contains a large
number of different cytochromes. The cytochromes help the
bacterium donate electrons to different kinds of metals, even
insoluble forms such as iron and cobalt embedded within clay.
How can bacteria reduce a substance outside their cell
envelopes? Nealson’s colleague Mohamed El-Naggar found
that Shewanella bacteria transfer electrons via nanowires (see
Fig. 14.2). The nanowire extensions of periplasm help bacteria connect with each other in a biofilm, and transfer a current to the metal electron acceptor. In an electrolytic fuel cell,
the bacteria form a biofilm on the anode (electron-attracting
electrode) (Fig. 1B). As the bacteria oxidize organic fuel, they
cause charge separation between electrons and hydrogen
ions. The electrons then pass within a current to the cathode.

to use them. For example, as oxygen grows scarce, denitrifying bacteria reduce nitrate to nitrogen gas (NO3 – → N2). As
nitrate is used up, other species reduce manganese (Mn4+ →
Mn2+), iron (Fe3+ → Fe2+), and sulfate (SO42– → H 2S). At
the bottom of the lake or sediment, methanogenic archaea
reduce carbon dioxide to methane (see Section 14.5). Microbial reduction of minerals plays a critical role in every ecosystem and participates in the geochemical cycling of elements
throughout Earth’s biosphere (discussed in Chapter 22).

Thought Question

14.9 The proposed scheme for uranium removal requires
injection of acetate under highly anoxic conditions, with less
than 1 part per million (ppm) dissolved oxygen. Why must the
acetate be anoxic?

The “fuel” for the cell can be a mixture of organic substances derived from any kind of food waste or sewage.
Organic waste includes small organic molecules such as lactate, acetate, and even formaldehyde. The biofilm bacteria
on the anode can remove hydrogens from these organic molecules, separating the electrons and hydrogen ions (Fig. 1C).
The hydrogen ions migrate through a polymer membrane,
whereas the electrons enter the anode leading to an electrical wire. The remaining carbon and oxygen atoms of the fuel
are released as CO2. The process is similar to natural respiration, except that instead of molecular oxygen, the electron
acceptor is an electrode made of graphite. To complete the
circuit, the electrons from the wire current ultimately react
with oxygen and hydrogen ions to form water, as in aerobic
respiration.
So far, microbial fuel cells have been able to generate milliamps of current, enough to drive small devices, such as clocks
and marine data sensors. Microbial fuel cells offer a clean way
to make electricity, with inexpensive fuel. The main challenge
is generating larger currents. Many researchers are working to
ramp up the currents and make the dream of bacterial electricity a reality.

Anaerobic terminal electron acceptors, such as nitrogen and sulfur oxyanions, oxidized metal cations, and
oxidized organic substrates, accept electrons from a specific reductase complex of an ETS.
Nitrate is successively reduced by bacteria to nitrite, nitric

Sulfate is successively reduced by bacteria to sulfite,

Many reduced minerals and single-carbon compounds can
serve as electron donors for an ETS, in the energy-yielding
form of metabolism known as lithotrophy (or chemolithotrophy). Some organotrophs have alternative oxidoreductases that conduct lithotrophy by oxidizing H 2 or Fe2+;

oxidizes hydrogen gas released by mixed-acid-fermenting
bacteria in the colon. Other bacteria are “obligate lithotrophs”; that is, they oxidize only inorganic molecules.
All lithotrophs are bacteria or archaea. Thus, bacteria and
archaea fill many key niches in ecosystems that eukaryotes
cannot.
Lithotrophy includes many kinds of electron donors,
from metals and anions to single-carbon groups
(Table 14.2). Each type of electron donor, such as H 2,
NH4+, or Fe2+, requires a specialized electron-accepting
oxidoreductase. Most inorganic substrates other than H 2
are relatively poor electron donors compared to organic
donors such as glucose. Therefore, the terminal electron
acceptor is usually a strong oxidant, such as O2, NO3 –, or
Fe3+. Obligate lithotrophs (organisms that conduct only
lithotrophy) consume no organic carbon source; they build
biomass by fixing CO2 (a process discussed in Chapter 15).

Reduced metal ions such as Fe and Mn provide energy
through oxidation by O2 or NO3 –. Bacteria perform these
lithotrophic reactions in soil where weathering exposes
reduced minerals. They generate metal ions with higher
oxidation states (such as Fe3+ or Mn4+), which other bacteria use for anaerobic respiration. Environments such
as ponds and wetlands that experience frequent shifts
between oxygen availability and oxygen depletion are
likely to host a variety of metal-oxidizing lithotrophs,
as well as metal-reducing anaerobic heterotrophs. The
roles of lithotrophy in ecology are discussed further in
Chapters 21 and 22.
An example of lithotrophy is iron oxidation by the bacterium Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Fig. 14.22). These
bacteria oxidize Fe2+ (ferrous ion) using the reduction
potential between Fe3+/Fe2+ and O2/H 2O:
E°′ (pH 2)
2Fe2+ → 2Fe3+ + 2e– (pH 2)
½O2 + 2H+ + 2e– → H2O (pH 2)

The removal of electrons from Fe2+ requires an input of
energy, which is compensated for by the larger yield of
energy from reducing oxygen to water. The net reduction
potential is small; thus, A. ferrooxidans must cycle large
quantities of iron in order to grow. Because the reaction
consumes H+, it goes forward only at low pH, such as
that of acid mine drainage where other microbes oxidize
sulfur to sulfuric acid. The bacterial cell must keep its

the electrical potential Δψ (positive inside). Thus, the
proton potential Δp exists entirely in the form of ΔpH.
The ∆pH drives ATP synthesis.
Unlike organic electron donors, metals such as iron
must be accessed from insoluble particles outside the cell.
In A. ferrooxidans, the electrons are collected from iron
outside by an outer membrane cytochrome c 2. The cytochrome is associated with a periplasmic protein called rusticyanin. Rusticyanin collects electrons while excluding the
potentially toxic metal from the cell. The electrons from
rusticyanin can be transferred to an inner membrane cytochrome complex that reduces oxygen to water.
For iron oxidation, the ΔG of reaction is too small to
pump protons. So how do cells obtain enough energy to
form NADPH for biosynthesis? An alternative pathway
directs electrons to an enzyme complex that uses proton
influx (spends Δp) to convert NADP+ to NADPH. This
pathway is called reverse electron flow, because it reverses
the flux of electrons seen in an ETS that spends NADH
(or NADPH) to form NAD+ (or NADP+). In reverse electron flow, a relatively poor electron donor (such as 2Fe2+)
reduces an ETS with an unfavorable reduction potential,
requiring input of energy to generate NADH or NADPH.
For iron oxidation, the energy input comes from the large
ΔpH across the inner membrane (pH 6.5 inside, and pH
2 outside). Reverse electron flow is seen in some kinds of
lithotrophy, in syntrophy (discussed in Chapter 13), and in
phototrophy (discussed in Section 14.6).

Nitrogen Oxidation

oxidation of nitrogen compounds:

NH4+ → NH 2OH → HNO2 → HNO3
Ammonium

Nitrous acid
(nitrite)

Nitric acid
(nitrate)

Reduced forms of nitrogen, such as ammonium ion
derived from fertilizers, support growth of nitrifiers, bacteria that generate nitrites or nitrates (forming nitrous acid
or nitric acid, respectively). Acid production can degrade
environmental quality. In soil treated with artificial fertilizers, nitrifiers decrease the ammonium ions obtained from
such fertilizer and produce toxic concentrations of nitrites,
which leach into groundwater. Still, nitrifiers can be useful
in sewage treatment, where they eliminate ammonia that
would harm aquatic life (discussed in Chapter 22).
Ammonia/ammonium and nitrite are relatively poor
electron donors compared to organic molecules. Thus, their

oxidation through the ETS pumps fewer protons, and the
bacteria must cycle relatively large quantities of substrates
to grow. As we saw for iron oxidation, reduced cofactors
such as NADPH must be obtained through reverse electron flow involving redox carriers with different amounts
of energy.
What happens to ammonium ion from detritus that
accumulates in anaerobic regions, such as the bottom of a
lake? Surprisingly, NH4+ can yield energy through oxidation by nitrite (a product of nitrate respiration):
NH4+ + NO2 – → N2 + 2H 2O

ΔG°′ = –357 kJ/mol

Under conditions of high ammonium and extremely
low oxygen, nitrite oxidation of ammonium ion supports growth of bacteria. Known as the anammox reaction, anaerobic ammonium oxidation plays a major role
in wastewater treatment, where it eliminates much of the
ammonium ion from sewage breakdown. In the oceans,
anammox bacteria cycle as much as half of all the nitrogen
gas returned to the atmosphere.

is reduced by NH4+ to form hydrazine (N2H4). Hydrazine is
a toxic molecule that gets trapped in the anammoxosome
by the membrane composed of ladderanes. Hydrazine donates electrons to reduce nitrite, and gives off N2. Protons
may be pumped by the hydrazine synthase complex.

Anammox is conducted by planctomycetes, irregularly
shaped bacteria with unusual membranous organelles
that fill much of the cell (Fig. 14.23A). The central compartment is called the anammoxosome. The anammoxosome membrane is composed of unusual ladder-shaped
lipids called ladderanes. An enzyme of the anammoxosomal membrane reduces nitrite to NO plus H 2O
(Fig. 14.23B, step 1). Another membrane-embedded
enzyme, hydrazine synthase, catalyzes NO reduction by
NH4+ to form hydrazine (N2H4) (step 2). Hydrazine is
a high-energy compound that engineers use for rocket
fuel; the substance is highly toxic, so the planctomycete
keeps it sequestered within the specialized anammoxosome membrane.
The hydrazine is further oxidized to N2 (Fig. 14.23B,
step 3), and its protons are released within the anammoxosome compartment. The protons then drive an ATP synthase embedded in the anammoxosome membrane. The
hydrazine oxidation enzyme obtains additional electrons
from catabolism of organic substrates. Thus, anammox
bacteria are examples of microbes whose metabolism combines lithotrophy and organotrophy.

Sulfur and Metal Oxidation

Major sources of lithotrophic electron donors are minerals
containing reduced sulfur, such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfides of iron and copper. As we saw for nitrogen compounds,
each sulfur compound that undergoes partial oxidation may
serve as an electron donor and be further oxidized.

portrayed an imaginary alien creature, the Horta, that produced corrosive acid in order to eat its way through solid
rock (Fig. 14.24A). In actuality, of course, no creatures
beyond the size of a microbe are yet known to grow in
sulfuric acid. But archaea such as Sulfolobus species oxidize
hydrogen sulfide to sulfuric acid and grow at pH 2, often in
hot springs at near-boiling temperatures (Fig. 14.24B and
C). Sulfolobus makes irregular Horta-shaped cells without
even a cell wall to maintain shape; how it protects its cytoplasm from disintegration is not yet understood.
Microbial sulfur oxidation can cause severe environmental acidification, eroding concrete structures and stone
monuments. The problem is compounded by sulfur oxidation in the presence of iron, such as in iron mine drainage.
For example, the sulfur-oxidizing archaeon Ferroplasma
acidarmanus was discovered in the abandoned mine Iron
Mountain, in northern California, by Katrina Edwards
(1968–2014; University of Southern California) and colleagues from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Ferroplasma oxidizes ferrous disulfide (pyrite) with ferric iron
(Fe3+) and water:
FeS2 + 14Fe3+ + 8H 2O → 15Fe2+ + 2SO42– + 16H+
This reaction generates large quantities of sulfuric acid.
The acidity of the mine water is near pH 0—one of the
most acidic environments found on Earth. As Ferroplasma
grows, it forms biofilms of thick streamers in the mine
drainage, which poison aquatic streams.

Anaerobic reactions between sulfur and iron cause hidden hazards for human technology, such as the corrosion
of steel in underwater bridge supports. Anaerobic corrosion
was long considered a mystery, since iron was known to
rust by means of spontaneous oxidation by O2. In anaerobic conditions, however, sulfur-reducing bacteria can corrode iron (Fig. 14.25). In one pathway, the bacteria reduce
elemental sulfur (S0) with H 2 to hydrogen sulfide (H 2S).
H 2S then combines with iron metal (Fe0), which gives
up two electrons to form Fe2+, precipitating as iron sulfide (FeS). The displaced 2H+ combine with the 2e – from
iron, regenerating H 2 —now available to reduce sulfur once
again. In an alternative mechanism, bacteria use Fe0 to
reduce sulfate directly to FeS. These damaging processes
may resemble the iron-based metabolism of Earth’s most
ancient life-forms.
Nevertheless, like the imaginary Horta that ended up
helping miners with their excavations, acid-producing
microbes are now used to supplement commercial mining,
a process called “biomining.” Lithotrophs such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans oxidize sulfides of iron and copper

Hydrogenotrophy Uses H2
as an Electron Donor

The use of molecular hydrogen (H 2) as an electron donor is
called hydrogenotrophy (Table 14.3). An example is oxidation of H 2 by sulfur to form H 2S, performed by Pyrodictium brockii, an archaeon that grows at thermal vents
above 100°C. Hydrogen gas is a stronger electron donor
than most organic foods, so it can be oxidized with the full
range of electron acceptors. It is available in anaerobic communities as a fermentation product.
Hydrogenotrophy is hard to categorize. Because H 2 is
inorganic, oxidation by O2 is considered lithotrophy; yet
many species that oxidize H 2 with molecular oxygen are

found in minerals such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS2), chalcocite
(Cu 2S), and covellite (CuS). The oxidation of Cu+ to Cu 2+,
as well as the acidification resulting from production of sulfate, dissolves the metal from the rock. Cu+ can be oxidized
aerobically with O2 or anaerobically with NO3 – from the
soil. Other metals oxidized by A. ferrooxidans include selenium, antimony, molybdenum, and uranium. The process
of metal dissolution from ores is called leaching. Leaching
of minerals has been a part of mining since ancient times,
long before the existence of microbes was known. Today,
over 10% of the copper supply in the United States is provided by biomining ores too low in copper to smelt directly
(Fig. 14.26). A similar process is being developed to biomine gold.

Methanogenesis

A.

Hydrogen is such a strong electron donor that it can
even reduce the highly stable carbon dioxide to methane.
Reduction of CO2 and other single-carbon compounds,
such as formate, to methane is called methanogenesis.
Methanogenesis supports a major group of archaea known
as methanogens, many of which grow solely by autotrophy,
generating methane.
The simplest form of methanogenesis involves hydrogen
reduction of CO2:

chlorobenzenes, perchloroethene, and polyvinyl chloride
(known as PVC) are highly toxic environmental pollutants. In dehalorespiration, the chlorine is removed as chloride anion and replaced by hydrogen—a reaction requiring
input of two electrons from H 2. Many soil bacteria conduct dehalorespiration; a particularly unusual cell wall–less
bacterium, Dehalococcoides (Fig. 14.27B), was discovered
that dechlorinates chlorobenzene, a highly stable aromatic

organotrophs that also catabolize organic foods. When
hydrogen reduces an organic electron acceptor, such as
fumarate, the process may be considered either fermentation or anaerobic respiration. When hydrogen reduces a
mineral such as sulfur or sulfate, the process is anaerobic

A form of hydrogenotrophy with enormous potential for bioremediation is “dehalorespiration,” in which
halogenated organic molecules serve as electron acceptors for H 2 (Fig. 14.27A). Chlorinated molecules such as

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Because both sides of the equation contain a weak electron
acceptor (CO2, H 2O) and a strong electron donor (H 2,
CH4), it was surprising that such a reaction could yield
energy for growth. But the presence of sufficient carbon
dioxide and hydrogen supports enormous communities
of methanogens. Such conditions prevail wherever bacteria grow by fermentation and their gaseous products are
trapped, such as in landfills, where methane can be harvested as natural gas, as well as in the digestive systems of
cattle and humans. Variants of methanogenesis also include
pathways by which H 2 reduces various one-carbon and
two-carbon molecules, such as methanol, methylamine,
and acetic acid. Diverse methanogens are found in all kinds
of environments (discussed in Chapter 19).
A simplified pathway of methanogenesis from CO2
is shown in Figure 14.28. The CO2 undergoes stepwise
hydrogenation, and each oxygen is reduced to water. The
increasingly reduced carbon is transferred through a series
of unique cofactors (methanofuran, tetrahydromethanopterin, coenzyme M-SH). Three of the hydrogenation steps
involve a membrane ETS complex that includes the carrier
coenzyme F420, whose reaction generates a proton potential. Note, however, that the final step of methane production generates a transmembrane sodium potential (ΔNa+),
which drives ATP synthesis by a sodium-powered ATP synthase embedded in the cell membrane. Further details of
methanogenesis are presented in Chapter 19.

Methylotrophy

Many forms of catabolism release reduced single-carbon
molecules such as methanol (CH3OH) or methylamine
(CH3NH2). Oxidation of single-carbon molecules via an ETS
is called methylotrophy, a form of metabolism conducted
by many soil bacteria. In addition, the methane released
by methanogenesis provides a niche for methanotrophy, a
form of methylotrophy in which bacteria and archaea oxidize
methane. In deep-ocean sediment, the activity of methanogens is so high that enormous quantities of methane become
trapped on the seafloor in the form of water-based crystals
known as methane hydrates. If all the methane were to be
released at once, it would greatly accelerate global warming.
How is this methane recycled? Until recently, it was
thought that most methanotrophy required O2; indeed,
many bacteria are aerobic methanotrophs. However, the
deep-ocean sediments contain other species of bacteria and

Lithotrophy (chemolithotrophy) is the acquisition of
energy by oxidation of inorganic electron donors.
Reverse electron flow powered by Δp can generate
NADH or NADPH.
Sulfur oxidation includes oxidation of H 2S to sulfur
or to sulfuric acid by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, often
accompanied by iron oxidation. Sulfuric acid production
leads to extreme acidification.
Nitrogen oxidation includes successive oxidation of
ammonia to hydroxylamine, nitrous acid, and nitric
acid. Anammox, the oxidation of ammonium ion by
nitrite, returns half the ocean’s N2 to the atmosphere.
Hydrogenotrophy uses hydrogen gas as an electron
donor. Hydrogen (H 2) has sufficient reducing potential to donate electrons to nearly all biological electron
acceptors, including chlorinated organic molecules
(through dehalorespiration).
Methanogenesis is the oxidation of H 2 by CO2, releasing methane. Methanogenesis is performed only by the
methanogen group of archaea.
Methylotrophs use O2, nitrite, or sulfate to oxidize
single-carbon compounds such as methane, methanol, or
methylamine. A class of methylotrophs called methanotrophs specifically oxidize methane.

Retinal-Based Proton Pumps

In most ecosystems, the dominant source of carbon and
energy is photosynthesis based on chlorophyll. At the same
time, many halophilic archaea and marine bacteria supplement their metabolism with a simpler, more ancient form of
phototrophy based on a single-protein light-driven proton
pump containing the pigment retinal. Many varieties of the
retinal-based proton pump have evolved, known as bacteriorhodopsin in haloarchaea and as proteorhodopsin in
bacteria. We present bacteriorhodopsin as a relatively simple
form of phototrophy, followed by the more complex ETSbased photolysis in bacteria and chloroplasts.

Phototrophy

On Earth today, the ultimate source of electrons driving
metabolism is phototrophy, the use of photoexcited electrons to power cell growth. Every year, photosynthesis
converts more than 10% of atmospheric carbon dioxide to
biomass, most of which then feeds microbial and animal
heterotrophs. Most of Earth’s photosynthetic production,
especially in the oceans, comes from microbes (discussed in
Chapter 21). Even the frigid seas of Antarctica support vast
communities of phototrophic algae and bacteria, at –2°C
beneath pack ice (Fig. 14.29).
In phototrophy, the energy of a photoexcited electron
is transferred through an ETS to pump protons. Different
kinds of phototrophy include the bacteriorhodopsin proton
pump; the single-cycle chlorophyll-based photosystems I

dopsin is a small membrane protein commonly found in
halophilic archaea (or haloarchaea) such as Halobacterium
salinarum, a single-celled archaeon that grows in evaporating salt flats containing concentrated NaCl (discussed in
Chapter 19). For many years, bacteriorhodopsin-like proton
pumps were thought to be limited to extreme halophilic
archaea. As bacterial genomes were sequenced, however,
homologs of the protein appeared in several species of proteobacteria; the homologs were termed proteorhodopsin.
The proteorhodopsin genes appear to have entered bacteria by horizontal transfer from halophilic archaea. In 2005,
Oded Béjà and colleagues from Israel, Austria, Korea, and
the United States surveyed the genomes of unculturable
bacteria from the upper waters of the Mediterranean and
Red seas. They found that 13% of the marine bacteria contain proteorhodopsins, accounting for a substantial—and
previously unrecognized—fraction of marine phototrophy.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

Bacteriorhodopsin absorbs light with a broad peak in the
green range; thus, the organisms containing large amounts
of bacteriorhodopsin reflect blue and red, appearing purple.
The protein consists of seven hydrophobic alpha helices surrounding a molecule of retinal, the same cofactor bound to
light-absorbing opsins in the vertebrate retina (Fig. 14.30A).
In bacteriorhodopsin, the retinal is attached to the nitrogen
end of a lysine residue (Fig. 14.30B).
Retinal has a series of conjugated double bonds that
absorb visible light. Upon absorbing a photon, an electron

in one of the double bonds is excited to a higher energy level.
This process is called photoexcitation. As the electron falls
back to the ground state, the double bond shifts position
from trans (substituents pointing opposite) to cis (substituents pointing in the same direction). This change in shape
of the retinal alters the conformation of the entire protein,
causing it to pick up a proton from the cytoplasm. Eventually, the retinal switches back to its original trans configuration. The reversion to trans is coupled to the release of
a proton from the opposite end of the protein facing outside of the cell. Thus, photoexcitation of bacteriorhodopsin
is coupled to the pumping of one H+ across the membrane.
The proton gradient generated by bacteriorhodopsin drives
ATP synthesis by a typical F1Fo ATP synthase. Light capture
by bacteriorhodopsin supplements catabolism for energy and
heterotrophy for carbon source. This combination of light
absorption and heterotrophy is a form of photoheterotrophy.

phototroph needs to solve is how to “capture” light rays. For
chemotrophy, food molecules diffuse in solution and can be
picked up by receptors for transport into a cell. Phototrophy,
however, requires a photon to impinge on one point of the
cell, where the photon either is absorbed or passes through.
Thus, the only way to absorb a high percentage of photons is
to spread light-absorbing pigments over a wide surface area.
To maximize light absorption, Halobacterium salinarum
archaea pack their entire cell membranes with bacteriorhodopsin. The protein assembles in trimers that pack in hexagonal arrays, forming the “purple membrane” (Fig. 14.31).

Chlorophyll Photoexcitation
and Photolysis

Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts, as well as other kinds of
bacteria, obtain energy by photoexcitation of chlorophylls.
Figuring out their “light reactions”—the fundamental
source of energy for Earth’s biosphere—was one of the most
exciting projects of the twentieth century. Among hundreds
of important contributors, we note two major figures: the
married couple Roger Stanier (1916–1982) and Germaine
Cohen-Bazire (1920–2001) (Fig. 14.32A and B). Stanier,
a Canadian microbial physiologist at UC Berkeley, clarified
the nature of cyanobacteria as phototrophic prokaryotes
distinct from eukaryotic algae, and he helped distinguish
the water-based photosynthesis of cyanobacteria from the
sulfide metabolism of purple bacteria. Cohen-Bazire was a
French bacterial geneticist who had studied lac operon regulation with Nobel laureate Jacques Monod at the Pasteur
Institute in Paris. Cohen-Bazire applied her genetics skills
to phototrophs, and she conducted the first genetic analysis
of photosynthesis in purple bacteria and cyanobacteria.
Cyanobacteria, the only oxygen-producing bacteria, appear
green, like algae or plants (Fig. 14.32C). Their green color
arises from their chlorophyll, which absorbs blue and red but
reflects green. Cyanobacteria include a wide range of species,
such as the ocean’s major producers, the submicroscopic Prochlorococcus marinus, barely visible under a light microscope.
Other cyanobacteria have cells as large as eukaryotic algae and
form complex developmental structures with important symbiotic associations (see Chapters 18 and 21). Cyanobacteria
are among the most successful and diverse groups of life on

Earth. Along with the chloroplasts of algae and plants, cyanobacteria produce all the oxygen available for aerobic life.
Overview of photolysis. The energy for photosynthesis

derives from the photoexcitation of a light-absorbing pigment. Photoexcitation leads to photolysis, the light-driven
separation of an electron from a molecule coupled to an
ETS. The components of the ETS are often homologous
to those of respiratory electron transport, and they share
common electron carriers such as iron-sulfur clusters.
In plant chloroplasts and in cyanobacteria, photolysis
is known as the “light reactions,” coupled to the “lightindependent reactions” of carbon dioxide fixation. Note,
however, that many of the sulfur- or organic-based bacterial phototrophs, such as Rhodospirillum rubrum, combine
photolysis with heterotrophy instead of with CO2 fixation.
At the same time, lithotrophic bacteria such as Nitrospira
and Acidithiobacillus fix CO2 using energy from mineral
oxidation instead of photolysis. In this chapter we focus on
photolysis in cyanobacteria. We discuss CO2 fixation along
with other biosynthetic pathways later, in Chapter 15.

Chlorophyll structure.

Chlorophyll has a heterocyclic chromophore
with a magnesium ion coordinated to four
nitrogens. Different chlorophyll types differ
mainly in small substituents of the chromophore; for example, an aldehyde replaces the
ring II methyl group of chlorophyll a to make
chlorophyll b.

In ETS-based photosynthesis, photoexcitation leads to
separation of an electron from a donor molecule such as
H 2O or H 2S. Each electron is then transferred to an ETS,
whose components show common ancestry with respiratory ETS proteins. The ETS generates a proton potential
and the reduced cofactor NADPH. The proton potential drives ATP synthesis through an F1Fo ATP synthase,
similar to the one for respiration.
Chlorophylls absorb light. The main light-absorbing pig-

ments are chlorophylls. Each type of chlorophyll contains
a characteristic chromophore, a light-absorbing electron
carrier. The chlorophyll chromophore consists of a heteroaromatic ring complexed to a magnesium ion (Mg2+)
(Fig. 14.33). As we saw for ETS electron carriers, metal
ions and aromatic molecules offer electrons with relatively
narrow energy transitions. The chromophore absorbs a photon through a reversible energy transition, such that the
chlorophyll can alternate between excited and ground states.
Chlorophyll molecules differ slightly in their substituent
groups around the ring; for example, chlorophyll a of chloroplasts has a methyl group in ring II, whereas chlorophyll b
has an aldehyde. Both chlorophylls a and b are made by chloroplasts and by cyanobacteria, their nearest bacterial relatives.
Because they absorb red and blue, they reflect the middle
range of the spectrum and so appear green (Fig. 14.34A).

By contrast, the chlorophylls of anaerobic phototrophs, or
“purple bacteria,” such as Rhodobacter and Rhodospirillum,
absorb most strongly in the far-red (infrared) and, in some
cases, ultraviolet ranges (Fig. 14.34B). Their chlorophylls
are specifically named bacteriochlorophylls. The purple
bacteria grow in pond water or sediment. Bacteriochlorophyll absorption over an extended range of wavelengths
helps capture light missed by the cyanobacteria and algae at
the water’s surface. In purple bacteria, bacteriochlorophylls
are supplemented by accessory pigments called carotenoids,
which absorb light of green wavelengths and transfer the

energy to bacteriochlorophyll. The combination of greenabsorbing carotenoids and infrared-absorbing bacteriochlorophylls makes cultures appear deep purple or brown.
The infrared radiation absorbed by bacteriochlorophylls
is too weak to permit splitting H 2O to produce oxygen.
Thus, purple bacteria are limited to photolysis of H 2S and
small organic molecules; many are photoheterotrophs. On
the other hand, infrared rays are available in water below
the oxygenic phototrophs absorbing red and blue. Thus,
anaerobic phototrophs grow at depths where their more
high-powered oxygenic relatives do not.

Note:

Distinguish among these classes of photopigments:

■ Bacteriorhodopsin is a retinal-containing proton pump.
■ Chlorophyll is a charge-separating photopigment (usually refer-

ring to chloroplasts and cyanobacteria).

■ Bacteriochlorophyll is a charge-separating chlorophyll of

anaerobic purple and green bacteria (also known generically as
chlorophyll).

■ Carotenoid is an accessory pigment that absorbs the midrange

of light wavelengths but does not directly conduct photolysis.

Instead, they must be captured by absorption. The larger

be captured.
To maximize light collection, many molecules of chlorophyll are grouped in an antenna complex. These antenna
complexes are arranged like a satellite dish within the plane
of the membrane in an elaborate cluster around accessory
proteins (Fig. 14.35A and B). The clusters then associate

in a ring around the reaction center (RC), the protein
complex in which chlorophyll photoexcitation connects to
the ETS (Fig. 14.35C). Throughout the complex of bacteeriochlorophylls and accessory pigments, whichever pigment
nt
molecule happens to be in the right place at the right time
me
captures the photon. The energy from the photon then
en
transfers at random from one chromophore to the next,
xt,
until it arrives at the reaction center for electron transfer
fer
to the ETS. Other kinds of bacteria have other forms of
antenna complexes, such as the “phycobilisome” of cyanoobacteria (discussed shortly).
Purple bacteria and cyanobacteria increase their effifihe
ciency of photon uptake by extensive backfolding of the
photosynthetic membranes in oval pockets stacked like pita
ta
breads (Fig. 14.36). These oval pockets are called thylakoids. The extensive packing of thylakoids gives an incident photon hundreds of chances to meet a chlorophyll at
just the right angle for absorption.
The thylakoids are connected by tubular extensions, so
that there exists one interior space, the lumen, separated
topologically from the regular cytoplasm, or stroma. Protons are pumped from the stroma across the thylakoid
membrane into the lumen. The F1Fo complex is embedded
in the thylakoid, where it makes ATP using the proton current running through it into the cytoplasm. The F1 knob of
ATP synthase appears to face “outward” in photosynthetic
organelles (as opposed to “inward” in respiratory chains).
In each case, however, the proton current and ATP motor
face in the same direction with respect to the cytoplasm
(stroma). The proton potential is more negative in the cytoplasm (stroma), thus drawing protons through the ATP
synthase to generate ATP.

the absorption of light by chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophyll drives the separation of an electron. The chlorophyll
may then gain an electron from the ETS, as in Rhodospirillum or Rhodobacter, or it may remove an electron from
H 2 S or H 2O, depending on the photosystem of a given
bacterial species. In either case, the excited electron carries energy gained from the light absorbed. The excited
electron enters a membrane-embedded ETS of oxidoreductases and quinones/quinols, as we saw for the ETS of
respiration and lithotrophy.
Diverse kinds of photosynthesis in different environmental niches include oxygenic, sulfur-based, iron-dependent, and even heterotrophic photolysis. Nevertheless, all
forms of photolysis share a common design:
1. Antenna system. The antenna system (Fig. 14.35)
maximizes photon capture. A phototrophic antenna
system is a large complex of chlorophylls that captures photons and transfers their energy among the

photopigments until it reaches
a reaction center. A complex of
chlorophylls and accessory pigments in the photosynthetic membrane collects photons. Energy
from each photoexcited electron
is transferred among antenna pigments and eventually to the reaction center.
2. Reaction center complex. In the
reaction center, the photon energy
is used to separate an electron
from chlorophyll. The electron
is replaced by one from a small
molecule such as H2S (photosystem I, or PS I) or from the ETS
(photosystem II, or PS II).
3. Electron transport system. Each
photoexcited electron enters an
ETS. In PS I, electrons separated
from H2O or H2S are transferred
to NADP+ to form NADPH. In
PS II, the electron separated from
bacteriochlorophyll is replaced
by an electron returned from the
ETS. In the oxygenic Z pathway
(H2O photolysis), electrons flow
from PS II into PS I, ultimately
releasing O2 from H2O.
4. Energy carriers. In PS I, electrons are used to make NADPH.
In PS II, electron transfer provides energy to pump protons and
drive the synthesis of ATP. The Z
pathway makes both NADPH and
ATP, which are used to fix CO2.

found in cyanobacteria and in the chloroplasts of green
plants.
The components of photosystems I and II (PS I and
PS II) share common ancestry. Each system runs anaerobically, producing sulfur or oxidized organic by-products,
but not O2. Each photosystem shows more recent homology with the respective PS I and PS II components of the
oxygenic Z pathway (so called because the electron path
through a diagram of the two photosystems traces a Z).
The Z pathway ultimately generates O2 —the source of
nearly all the oxygen we breathe.

Note:

In photolysis, each quantum of light excites a single electron. Some ETS components, such as the quinones/quinols (Q →
QH2) actually process two of these electrons in completing their
redox cycle. The single-electron intermediate states of quinones
are not shown in Figures 14.37, 14.38, and 14.40.

Photosystem I in chlorobia. Bacteria such as Chlorobium

species use PSI (Fig. 14.37). The reaction center (RC) contains bacteriochlorophyll P840, named for its peak absorption at 840 nm—that is, the near-infrared, actually beyond
the range humans can see. But P840 and the chlorophylls

CHAPTER 14

■

of the antenna complex also absorb light over shorter wavelengths, in the range of 400–550 nm.
The Chlorobium antenna complex consists of a membrane
compartment called a chlorosome (Fig. 14.37B). A single
chlorosome may contain 200,000 molecules of bacteriochlorophyll, harvesting photons with nearly 100% efficiency.
The chlorosome is so sensitive that some chlorobia actually
harvest thermal radiation from deep-sea thermal vents.
When any one bacteriochlorophyll absorbs a photon, the
energy transfers among the photopigments until it reaches
the PS I reaction center (Fig. 14.37). The photon yields
sufficient energy to donate the high-potential electron to
a high-potential quinone: phylloquinone/phylloquinol
(PQ). Phylloquinol donates the electron to ferredoxin,
an FeS protein. Ferredoxin transfers the electron to the
enzyme ferredoxin-NAD+ reductase; two of these electrons
then reduce NAD+ or the energetically equivalent NADP+.
The reduced carrier (NADH or NADPH) provides reductive energy for CO2 fixation and biosynthesis (discussed in
Chapter 15).
Chlorobium is a true autotroph, fixing CO2 for biosynthesis (see Chapter 15). However, the phototrophic ETS
is supplemented by lithotrophy, the donation of electrons
from sulfur or H 2. The PS I electron flow generates a net
proton gradient by consuming H+ inside and generating
H+ outside the cell, thus providing proton motive force to
drive ATP synthesis.

alphaproteobacteria such as Rhodospirillum rubrum and
Rhodopseudomonas palustris are typically found in wetlands and streams, where they capture light not used by
other phototrophs. Their antenna complex was shown
earlier, in Figure 14.35. The peak wavelength absorbed
by bacteriochlorophyll P870 lies so far into the infrared

(800–1,100 nm) that the photon energy is insufficient to
reduce NAD(P) to NAD(P)H. The electrons from P870
are transferred by low-potential quinols to a terminal cytochrome oxidoreductase (Fig. 14.38). The quinols pass
their electrons to cytochromes, while moving 2H+ across
the membrane. When the electrons reach cytochrome c,
they flow back to bacteriochlorophyll, where they can be
reexcited by photon energy from the antenna complex.
Because the electron path traces back to its source, the ETS
of photosystem II leading to ATP synthesis is called cyclic
photophosphorylation.
Since the reduction potential is too small to reduce
NADP+ to NADPH, photosystem II requires reverse electron flow. As we saw for iron oxidation (see Section 14.5), in
reverse electron flow a low-potential electron donor reduces
an ETS, requiring input of energy. Purple bacteria obtain
this energy by spending ATP to increase the proton potential, or from a pathway outside photolysis, such as catabolism of organic compounds. The organic compounds also
provide substrates for biosynthesis. Thus, most purple bacteria are photoheterotrophs.
Purple bacteria such as Rhodopseudomonas palustris are
the ultimate generalists, often combining several major
classes of metabolism (Fig. 14.39). Caroline Harwood
and colleagues at the University of Washington showed
that R. palustris is a “photolithoheterotroph,” capable
of photosynthesis, catabolism on many substrates, and
lithotrophy (eTopic 14.2). Anaerobically, R. palustris is
“the bacterium that eats everything,” catabolizing sugars,
fatty acids, and lignin to obtain reduced electron carriers.
Meanwhile, the bacteria make ATP through anoxygenic
photosynthesis (cyclic photophosphorylation). In the presence of oxygen, R. palustris can fix CO2 by lithotrophy.
These bacteria also fix atmospheric nitrogen (discussed
in Chapter 15). During nitrogen fixation (powered by

Thought Question

14.12 Suppose you discover bacteria that require a high concentration of Fe2+ for photosynthesis. Can you hypothesize what
the role of Fe2+ may be? How would you test your hypothesis?

Oxygenic photolysis. The “Z” pathway of photolysis found

in cyanobacteria and chloroplasts combines key features of
both PS II and PS I (Fig. 14.40 ). Both reaction centers,
however, contain chlorophylls that absorb at shorter wavelengths (higher energy) than those of the respective purple or green homologs: P680 instead of P870 (PS II), and
P700 instead of P840 (PS I). Thus, the cyanobacterial reaction centers can split water—a highly stable molecule that
cannot be photolyzed by anaerobic phototrophs. Photolysis
of water requires greater energy input, but ultimately yields
greater energy overall, and produces molecular oxygen. The
energy potentials are high enough to generate NADPH and
fi x CO2 into biomass (presented in Chapter 15). Oxygenic
phototrophs dominate the shallow water depths, whereas
anaerobes grow at lower depths, using light at wavelengths
unused by cyanobacteria and algae near the surface.
Cyanobacteria harvest light via an exceptionally efficient
antenna complex called the phycobilisome (Fig. 14.40B).
In the PS II reaction center, the photoexcitation of chlorophyll P680 yields enough energy to split H 2O. The entire
cycle of water splitting involves 4H+ removed from 2H 2O,
4e – transferred to carriers, and the formation of O2. The
net reaction forming oxygen is:
2H 2O → 4H+ + 4e – + O2
Through the ETS, the electrons are transferred to quinones. As in respiration, each 2e – reduction of quinone to
quinol requires pickup of 2H+ from the stroma (equivalent to cytoplasm). Thus, the four electrons transferred
generate a net change in the proton gradient of 4H+. Furthermore, the energy of electron transfer to cytochrome
bf enables pumping of an additional 2H+ across the membrane. Thus, in all, for each conversion of 2H 2O to O2
the net protons transferred across the thylakoid membrane include 4H+ (water photolysis) plus 4 × 2H+ (quinones to quinols) through cytochrome bf, to yield a total
of 12H+ for the proton gradient. The proton gradient
drives the ATP synthase to make approximately 3 ATP
per O2 formed.

The electrons from PS II do not cycle back to the PS II
reaction center, as they do in purple bacteria. Instead they
are transferred to PS I by a protein called plastocyanin.
The energy of the electron transferred by plastocyanin is
augmented through absorption of a second photon by the
chlorophyll of PS I. Subsequent electron flow through ferredoxin can now generate NADH or NADPH. Some of the
electron flow instead cycles back to cytochrome bf, where it
contributes to pumping protons.
The overall equation for energy yield of oxygenic photolysis can be represented as:
2H 2O + 2 NADP+ + 3 [ADP + Pi] →
O2 + 2 [NADPH + H+] + 3 ATP + 3H 2O
To release one O2 and fix one CO2 requires absorption
of between 8 and 12 photons. The efficiency—that is, the
proportion of photon energy converted to CO2 fixation—
is estimated to be 20%–30%. To generate one molecule of
glucose by CO2 fixation, we need six rounds of the photolysis equation—one per CO2 molecule “fixed” into sugar
(C6H12O6) (discussed in Chapter 15). The CO2 fixation
equation works out to:
12H 2O + 12 NADP+ + 18 [ADP + Pi] →
6O2 + 12 [NADPH + H+] + 18 ATP + 18H 2O
6CO2 + 12 [NADPH + H+] + 18 ATP + 18H 2O →
C6H12O6 + 6H 2O + 12 NADP+ + 18 [ADP + Pi]
12H 2O + 6CO2 → C6H12O6 + 6H 2O + 6O2

Bacteriorhodopsin and proteorhodopsin are forms of
a light-driven proton pump that contains retinal, found
in haloarchaea and in bacteria, respectively. The energy
gained from light absorption supplements heterotrophy.
The antenna complex of chlorophylls and other photopigments captures light for transfer to the reaction
center in chlorophyll-based photosynthesis.
Thylakoids are folded membranes within phototrophic
bacteria or chloroplasts. The membranes extend the area
for chlorophyll light absorption, and they separate two
compartments to form a proton gradient.
Photosystem I obtains electrons from H 2S or HS –.
The electrons are transferred through an ETS to form
NADH or NADPH.
Photosystem II transfers an electron through an ETS
and pumps H+ to generate ATP. An electron ultimately returns to bacteriochlorophyll through cyclic
photophosphorylation. Reverse electron flow generates
NADPH or NADH.

ow do microbes build their cells? Some bacteria and archaea build themselves entirely from
carbon dioxide and nitrogen gas, plus a few
salts. The cell assimilates carbon and nitrogen into
small molecules and then assembles more complex
structures using many enzymes. How do cells organize their biosynthesis to build precisely the forms
they need? How do bacteria avoid wasting energy on
excess production? New genomes reveal new microbial capacities for biosynthesis, ranging from antibiotics and pesticides to surgical materials.

15.1 Overview of Biosynthesis

What is the most interesting thing
about a new actinomycete producing
the antibiotic ristocetin?

The new actinomycete we discovered provides the first known gene
sequences for enzymes responsible
for ristocetin production. Discovery of
the cluster is a proof of principle for
our two-step bioassay system, verifying that it is actually working in a real-world screening for
glycopeptide natural products.
What new discoveries about antibiotics do you expect
to see?

Teicoplanin
(control antibiotic)

We would expect that if we extend the screening to cover
many more strains from different collections, we would
be able to discover entirely new glycopeptide antibiotics
and the genes that encode their synthesis. We also anticipate that some of the enzymes in the ristocetin cluster
will find use in helping to make novel combinatorial glycopeptide structures, which may have novel activity against
pathogens.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

In Chapters 13 and 14 we learned how microbes use chemical reactions to gain energy, storing it in ion gradients and
in small molecules such as ATP and NADPH. Chapter 15
shows how the microbes spend this energy for biosynthesis. An example is Amycolatopsis MJM2582, the actinomycete bacterium isolated by South Korean biochemist
Hee-Jeon Hong and colleagues at the University of Cambridge, including her student Min Jun Kwun (Fig. 15.1).
The white fuzz on the actinomycete colonies is full of
arthrospores (see Chapters 5 and 18), which can blow off to
another location. When the cell filaments enter stationary
phase (discussed in Chapter 4), they begin to produce dozens of different secondary products, such as the antibiotic
ristocetin (Fig. 15.1, inset). Such antibiotics show extraordinary diversity and complexity, often including multiple
aromatic rings—a surprising biosynthetic feat for an organism that’s running out of resources. But the antibiotics
enable the producer to outcompete other bacteria, killing
them to scavenge their substrates for biosynthesis. Antibiotic synthesis requires elaborate enzyme complexes and
multistep reaction pathways. Hong’s lab identified such a
pathway in the Amycolatopsis genome. The genome reveals
a span of 79,000 base pairs comprising thirty-nine genes
for enzymes, regulators, and transporters—all to produce
and export the antibiotic ristocetin.
Chapter 15 presents the fundamental ways that microbes
perform biosynthesis. Autotrophs assimilate elements such
as carbon and nitrogen to build useful carbon skeletons, key

HO

functions in the food web. Microbial enzyme factories build
remarkably complex biomolecules, including vitamins and
antibiotics important for human health. Industrial applications of microbial biosynthesis are described in Chapter 16.

15.1

Biosynthesis is the building of complex biomolecules,
also known as anabolism, the reverse of catabolism. Figure 15.2 presents an overview of anabolism, or biosynthesis,
and how it relates to catabolic pathways we saw in Chapter
13. Enzyme pathways such as the TCA cycle are reversed to
build up carbon skeletons, incorporating nitrogen to form
amino acids. Ultimately, sugar monomers and amino acids
are assembled to form polysaccharides, polypeptides, and
the cell wall material, peptidoglycan. Besides the biomass
of the cell proper, cells synthesize and secrete products such
as antibiotics, toxins for pathogenesis, quorum signals for
cooperation, and matrix for biofilm (eTopic 15.1). All this
biosynthesis requires substrates and energy.

Biosynthesis Requires Substrates

For their biosynthesis, where do microbes obtain their
organic substrates, such as acetyl-CoA? Some microbes
synthesize all their organic parts from minerals such as

carbonate and nitrate (autotrophy). Two fundamental
classes of autotrophy are photosynthesis and chemosynthesis. In photosynthesis, or photoautotrophy, single carbon
molecules (usually CO2) are fixed into organic biomass,
using energy from light absorption (discussed in Chapter 14). Chemosynthesis fixes carbon dioxide via similar
pathways, but without light. The energy for chemosynthesis usually comes from oxidation of minerals (lithotrophy; see Chapter 14). Other microorganisms must obtain
organic substrates from their environment (heterotrophy).
Many soil microbes are capable of both autotrophy and heterotrophy, depending on what their environment provides.
For all organisms, biosynthesis requires:
■

Essential elements. Biosynthesis requires carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and other essential elements.
Carbon is obtained either through CO2 fi xation (autotrophy) or through acquisition of organic molecules
made by other organisms (heterotrophy). Autotrophy

assembles carbon and water into small molecules such
as acetyl-CoA, which then serve as substrates or building blocks for the cell. By contrast, heterotrophy breaks
down larger molecules such as carbohydrates and peptides to release acetyl-CoA and other small substrates. In
addition to carbon, biosynthesis must assimilate nitrogen and sulfur for proteins, phosphorus for DNA, and
metals for metal-containing enzymes.
■

Reduction. Biosynthesis usually reduces the substrate,
by hydrogenation and by removing oxygen. Cell components such as lipids and amino acids are more reduced
than substrates such as CO2 and acetate, so their biosynthesis requires a reducing agent such as NADPH.

■

Energy. Building complex structures, with or without
reduction, requires energy. Biosynthetic enzymes spend
energy by coupling their reactions to the hydrolysis of
ATP, the oxidation of NADPH, or the flux of ions down
a transmembrane ion gradient.

Heterotrophs such as E. coli and actinomycetes obtain
many substrates from glucose catabolism and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, central catabolic pathways discussed
in Chapter 13 (Fig. 15.3). For example, the succinyl-CoA
molecules from the TCA cycle serve as the foundation of
several kinds of amino acids, as well as vitamin B12. Glycerol 3-phosphate provides the glyceride backbone of lipids.
Pyruvate provides the backbone of several amino acids with

aliphatic side chains. From the pentose phosphate pathway erythrose 4-phosphate contributes to the ring structures of aromatic amino acids. Other amino acids derive
their carbon skeleton from TCA cycle intermediates oxaloacetate and 2-oxoglutarate, which incorporate nitrogen in
the form of ammonium ions (NH4+).
Note that glucose catabolism and the TCA cycle are
both reversible. Some autotrophs can synthesize entire

CHAPTER 15

sugar molecules, starting with CO2 and working up
through the reverse TCA cycle and reverse glycolysis.
(The reversal of glycolysis is called gluconeogenesis).
Thus, many common metabolites are available both to
autotrophs and to heterotrophs, as well as to microbes
capable of mixed metabolism.

■

Thought Question

15.1 To run the TCA cycle and glycolysis in reverse, does a cell
use the same enzymes or different ones? Explain why some
enzymes might be used in both directions, whereas other steps
require different enzymes for catabolic and anabolic directions.

Competition and predation. Free-living bacteria
secrete antimicrobial agents that inhibit or kill competitors. The victors scavenge the spoils for raw materials. Actinomycetes, such as those discussed at the start
of the chapter, possess large genomes that commonly
encode enzymes for multiple antibiotics. High nutrient
levels inhibit antibiotic production, but as the bacterial
filaments grow more slowly in stationary phase, they
start producing antibiotics.

571

Genome loss and cooperation. A drastic way to avoid
the expense of biosynthesis is to lose the enzymes
through reductive evolution (discussed in Chapter 17).
But the species then depends on intricate relations with
other community members. Parasites and mutualists that
grow only within a host cell show the most extensive loss
of biosynthetic genes. Each species takes an evolutionary
path of maintaining the expense of a particular biosynthetic pathway, such as N2 fi xation, or of losing the pathway and becoming dependent on partner organisms.

Regulation. Biosynthesis is regulated at multiple levels, such as gene transcription, protein synthesis, and
allosteric enzyme control. In general, energy-expensive
products block the expression or function of their biosynthetic enzymes. For example, as we saw in Chapter 10, if the cell’s tryptophan concentration increases,
the molecule binds a corepressor to block transcription
of the genes for tryptophan biosynthesis; and the aminoacyl-tRNA stalls the ribosome midtranslation. In this
way, microbes avoid making more than they need under
given conditions. Microbes regulate their biosynthesis at
the levels of transcription and translation of enzymes, as
well as through feedback inhibition of enzyme activity.
An important example of molecular regulation is nitrogen fi xation, discussed in Section 15.5.

BIOSYNTHESIS

Surprisingly, many marine phototrophs no longer encode
certain biosynthetic pathways and depend on synthesis by
partner heterotrophs. For example, on the sea ice of the
Southern Ocean (temperatures around 0°C), Andrew Allen
at the J. Craig Venter Institute discovered a fundamental
mutualism of Antarctic diatoms and bacteria (Fig. 15.4).
The Southern Ocean is highly productive for biomass
and oxygen, because of the high solar irradiance and iron

Biosynthesis Spends Energy

Biosynthesis costs energy in several ways. The organism’s genome must maintain the DNA that encodes all
the enzymes that catalyze all the steps of the pathway.
The ribosomes spend energy to make enzymes. And the
enzymes couple synthetic reactions to energy-releasing
reactions. Collectively, these genomic and energetic costs
generate enormous selective pressure for microbes to evolve
mechanisms that control these costs. The diversity of these
cost-cutting mechanisms generates surprising ecological
relationships.

availability. Many of the sea ice phytoplankton (phototrophic algae) fail to synthesize vitamin B12, a fundamental
cofactor for enzymes but one of the most complicated biomolecules to synthesize. Allen’s group found that the Antarctic diatoms obtain vitamin B12 from adherent bacteria.
The major bacteria providing the vitamin are Oceanospirillales, a family of proteobacteria known for cleaning up oil
spills (see Chapter 21).
Closer to home, our gut bacteria also evolve ingenious
ways to share substrates and minimize biosynthesis. Samay
Pande and coworkers at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Biology, Jena, Germany, investigated resource sharing
in E. coli by constructing a complementary pair of mutants

A.

in which each overproduced an amino acid (histidine or
tryptophan). Pande found that when the growth medium
lacked the two complementary biosynthesis pathways (for
His or Trp), the two bacterial strains formed nanotubes of
phospholipids derived from the cell envelope (Fig. 15.5).
But when the medium provided the amino acids needed,
the nanotubes failed to form. Thus, even within the competitive gut microbial community, bacteria find ways to
share excess carbon substrates for biosynthesis—and regulate their sharing to avoid helping a competitor when a
ready source is available.
In this chapter we present the pathways by which autotrophs assimilate carbon and nitrogen into simple building
blocks, such as acetyl-CoA. Then we present pathways of
construction of the key parts of the cell, such as fatty acids
and amino acids. Finally, we consider exciting recent discoveries in the biosynthesis of secondary products such as
antibiotics.

15.2

The fundamental significance of carbon dioxide fixation by green plants and algae was recognized in the
early twentieth century. “Fixation” refers to the covalent
incorporation of a small molecule into larger biochemical material. Fixing carbon requires tremendous energy
input, as well as a large degree of reduction to incorporate hydrogen atoms.
The majority of the biomass on Earth consists of carbon fixed by chloroplasts and bacteria through the

reductive pentose phosphate cycle, which recycles a pentose phosphate intermediate. This cycle is also known as
the Calvin cycle, for which Melvin Calvin (1911–1997)
was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. The full
Calvin cycle is found only in bacteria and in chloroplasts,
which evolved from bacteria. It has not been found in
archaea or in the cytoplasm of eukaryotes. (Archaea and
some lithoautotrophic bacteria fix carbon by other pathways, as described in Section 15.3.) Thus, the Calvin cycle
appears to have evolved after the divergence of the three
domains of life.
The mechanism of the pentose phosphate cycle was
solved by Calvin with colleagues Andrew Benson and
James Bassham, at UC Berkeley. The importance of the
Calvin cycle to the global ecosystem can scarcely be overestimated; it plays a major role in removing atmospheric CO2.
The Calvin cycle’s responsiveness to CO2, temperature, and
other factors must be considered in all models of global
warming.

Note:

The Calvin cycle is also known as the Calvin-Benson
cycle, the Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle, or the CBB cycle. This
book uses the terms “Calvin cycle” and “CBB cycle.”

Several categories of bacteria conduct the Calvin cycle
(Fig. 15.6 and Table 15.1). Photoautotrophs such as cyanobacteria—and all plant chloroplasts—use the Calvin cycle
to fix CO2. Some photoheterotrophs, such as Rhodobacter
sphaeroides, use the Calvin cycle only when light is available; in the dark, they use preformed substrates (heterotrophy). Still other bacteria fix CO2 using energy from metal
oxidation (lithoautotrophy) (see Chapter 14). For example,

Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Fig. 15.6C) oxidizes sulfur
and iron, generating acid that corrodes concrete.
■

Oxygenic phototrophic bacteria (cyanobacteria) and
the chloroplasts of algae and multicellular plants fi x
CO2 by the Calvin cycle coupled to oxygenic photosynthesis. The Calvin cycle is also called the “dark reactions,” or “light-independent reactions,” of oxygenic
photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria are believed to generate
the majority of the oxygen gas in Earth’s atmosphere.

■

Facultatively anaerobic purple bacteria, including
sulfur oxidizers and photoheterotrophs such as Rhodospirillum and Rhodobacter, use the Calvin cycle to
fix CO2. These bacteria also obtain carbon through
catabolism.

■

Lithoautotrophic bacteria fix CO2 through the Calvin
cycle, using NADPH and ATP provided by the oxidation
of minerals. Mineral oxidation actually consumes oxygen.

Overview of the Calvin Cycle

Decades of biochemical and genetic experiments established
the details of CO2 fixation in the Calvin cycle. Early in the
twentieth century, biochemists tried to figure out the mechanism of CO2 fixation, believing that agricultural photosynthesis could be made more efficient. With the tools then
available, however, researchers had no hope of sorting out
the intermediate products through which CO2 was fixed.
A fundamental breakthrough was the use of tracer radioisotopes, which are specific compounds labeled with radioactivity. The discovery of the carbon isotope 14C by Martin

Kamen (1913–2002) in 1940 revolutionized biochemistry,
enabling the discovery of all kinds of cellular metabolism
(eTopic 15.2). Another key technique was paper chromatography, a means of separating labeled compounds based on
differential migration in a solvent. This technique reveals
short-lived intermediate compounds of a cycle. Calvin used
paper chromatography for his Nobel-winning experiments
to figure out the cycle that bears his name (eTopic 15.3).
Figure 15.7 shows an overview of the key steps of the
Calvin cycle. The cycle begins with CO2 fixation by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, a key intermediate that can derive
from the pentose phosphate cycle. This reaction is catalyzed
by the enzyme Rubisco (ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase), believed to be the most abundant protein
on Earth. (Further details of the Calvin cycle biochemistry,
including sugar regeneration, appear in Figure 15.9.)
In each “turn” of the cycle, one molecule of CO2 is condensed (combined, forming a new C–C bond) with the
five-carbon sugar ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The resulting
six-carbon intermediate splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA). The fixed CO2 ultimately ends up as
a carbon of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P), reduced by
2H+ + 2e – from NADPH + H+. Recall from Chapter 13 that
NADPH is a phosphorylated derivative of NADH commonly associated with biosynthesis. The phosphoryl group
of NADPH however does not participate in energy transfer.

How does the fixed CO2 become one “corner” of a glucose molecule? For every three turns of the cycle, fixing
three molecules of CO2, the cycle feeds one molecule of
G3P (C3H5O3 –PO32–) into biosynthesis:
3CO2 + 6 NA DPH + 6H+ + 9 ATP + 9H 2O →
C3H5O3 –PO32– + 6 NADP+ + 9 ADP + 8 Pi
The H 2O and the phosphoryl group of G3P are ultimately recycled during biosynthetic assimilation of G3P.
Two molecules of G3P may condense (that is, form a new
C–C bond) in a pathway to synthesize glucose. The overall
condensation of 6CO2 → 2 G3P → glucose yields:
6CO2 + 12 NA DPH + 12H+ + 18 ATP + 18H 2O →
C6H12O6 + 12 NADP+ + 18 ADP + 18 Pi
Alternatively, instead of conversion to glucose, G3P can
enter the biosynthetic pathways of amino acids, vitamins,
and other essential components of cells. Glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate is the fundamental unit of carbon assimilation
into biomass.

key enzyme of the Calvin cycle. The CO2-fi xing enzyme
is unique to bacteria and chloroplasts. Some archaeal
genomes do show a homolog of Rubisco, but the archaeal
enzyme does not fi x CO2. Instead, the archaeal Rubisco
forms PGA out of adenine, through a “scavenging pathway” of catabolism.
The structure of Rubisco is highly conserved across
bacterial and chloroplast domains. It consists of two types
of subunits, designated small and large (Fig. 15.8A).
The large (L) subunit contains the active (catalytic) site.
The function of the small (S) subunit remains unclear;
some bacteria, such as Rhodospirillum rubrum, have a
Rubisco with no small subunits. Different species contain

1. Carboxylation and splitting: 6C → 2[3C]. Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate condenses with CO2 and H2O,
mediated by Rubisco. Rubisco generates a six-carbon
intermediate, which immediately hydrolyzes (splits into
two parts by incorporating H2O). The split produces
two molecules of PGA, one of which contains the CO2
fixed by this cycle.
2. Reduction of PGA to G3P. The carboxyl group of
each PGA molecule is phosphorylated by ATP. The
phosphorylated carboxyl group is then hydrolyzed and
reduced by NADPH, forming G3P.
3. Regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. Of every
six G3P, resulting from three cycles of fixing CO2,
five G3P enter a complex series of reactions (including hydrolysis of 3 ATP) to regenerate three molecules
of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The net conversion

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

different multiples of the small and large subunits: eight
(in lithotrophs, green phototrophs, and some algae), six
(in plant chloroplasts and some algae), or two (in purple phototrophs). Nevertheless, the fundamental mechanism of CO2 fixation in all these organisms appears to
be similar.
Initially, Rubisco adds CO2 to ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate
to give an unstable six-carbon intermediate that remains
bound to the enzyme (Fig. 15.8B and C). The intermediate hydrolyzes into two molecules of PGA, each held at the
active site by its phosphate. Only one PGA molecule contains a carbon from the newly fixed CO2; nevertheless, as
both molecules dissociate from the enzyme, they enter the
cellular pool of PGA and behave equivalently in the rest of
the cycle.
Rubisco has a high affinity for CO2, and the typical concentration of Rubisco active sites (one per large subunit,
six per complex) in plant chloroplasts is 4 mM—about
500 times greater than the concentration of CO2. Thus,
considerable energy is invested in CO2 absorption. Yet
the efficiency of carbon fixation by Rubisco is lowered by
the existence of a competing reaction with O2 that leads
to 2-phosphoglycolate instead of 3-phosphoglycerate. This
oxygenation reaction is called photorespiration. The function of photorespiration has been studied intensively, but
remains unclear.

Thought Question

15.2 Speculate on why Rubisco catalyzes a competing reaction with oxygen. Why might researchers be unsuccessful in
attempting to engineer Rubisco without this reaction?

Regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. Overall, each

glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P) arises from three rounds
of CO2 fi xation by ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. Thus, to
maintain the cycle, for each G3P provided to biosynthesis,
five other molecules of G3P must be recycled into three
five-carbon molecules of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. Details
of regenerating the intermediate are shown in the lower
half of Figure 15.9.
The regeneration pathway is summarized here:
■

Two molecules of G3P condense to form the six-carbon
sugar fructose 6-phosphate.

■

Fructose 6-phosphate condenses with a third G3P. The
nine-carbon molecule splits to form a five-carbon sugar
(xylulose 5-phosphate) and a four-carbon sugar (erythrose 4-phosphate). Xylulose 5-phosphate rearranges to
ribulose 5-phosphate.

■

Erythrose 4-phosphate condenses with a fourth G3P
(rearranged to dihydroxyacetone 3-phosphate) to make
a seven-carbon sugar (sedoheptulose 7-phosphate).

■

The seven-carbon sugar condenses with the fifth G3P
and splits into two molecules of the ribulose 5-phosphate (via xylulose 5-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate).

■

Each of the three five-carbon sugars receives a second phosphoryl group from ATP, generating ribulose
1,5-bisphosphate. Each ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate is now
ready for Rubisco to fi x another CO2.

Why would a cycle have evolved requiring so many enzymatic steps to so many different intermediates? First, a cycle
with many steps breaks down the energy flow into numerous reversible conversions with near-zero values of ΔG. The
nearer to equilibrium, the more energy is conserved in the
conversion. Second, the multiple different intermediates
provide substrates for biosynthesis. For example, some molecules of erythrose 4-phosphate and ribose 5-phosphate are
withdrawn from the cycle to build aromatic amino acids
and nucleotides.

Thought Questions

15.3 Why does ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate have to contain two
phosphoryl groups, whereas the other intermediates of the
Calvin cycle contain only one?
15.4 Which catabolic pathway (see Chapter 13) includes

some of the same sugar-phosphate intermediates that the
Calvin cycle has? What might these intermediates in common
suggest about the evolution of the two pathways?

Regulation of the Calvin Cycle

How is the Calvin cycle organized and regulated? Expression of the CO2-fixing enzymes varies with CO2 concentration, light levels (for phototrophs), and temperature. The
concentration of CO2 is a special problem because CO2
diffuses readily through phospholipid membranes. Thus,
cells cannot concentrate this substrate across the cell membrane to reach the level needed to drive Rubisco. The gas
concentration problem is solved by some species through
enzymatic conversion of CO2 to bicarbonate (HCO3 –),
which is trapped in the cytoplasm, unable to leak out of the
cell membrane. This enzyme system is called the carbonconcentrating mechanism (CCM). Other bacteria use
alternative CO2-fixing systems adapted to different CO2
concentrations.
Carboxysomes contain Rubisco. Many organisms that
fi x CO2 contain the Rubisco complex within subcellular

as within cyanobacteria and chloroplasts. A carboxysome consists of a polyhedral shell of protein subunits
surrounding tightly packed molecules of Rubisco. The

carboxysome takes up bicarbonate (converted from CO2)
by an unknown process. Once inside the carboxysome,
the bicarbonate is immediately converted to CO2 by the
enzyme carbonic anhydrase. The CO2 is then fi xed by
Rubisco to PGA—the fi rst step of CO2 fi xation (shown in
Fig. 15.9). The PGA exits the carboxysome to complete
the Calvin cycle in the cytoplasm. Mutant strains of bacteria lacking carboxysomes can fi x CO2 only at high concentration (5%), much higher than the atmospheric CO2

Rubisco catalyzes the condensation of CO2 with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The six-carbon intermediate
immediately splits into two molecules of 3-phosphoglycerate (PGA), which are activated by ATP and reduced by
NADPH to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (G3P).
One of every six G3P is converted to glucose or
amino acids. The other five molecules of G3P undergo

by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The sbtA and

minute quantities of mRNA using the enzyme reverse transcriptase followed by the polymerase chain reaction (discussed in Section 12.2). In RT PCR, the RNA transcripts
are reverse-transcribed to DNA; the DNA is then amplified by PCR to generate a detectable product. RNA transcripts are obtained for genes expressed before and after
CO2 limitation. The sbtA and cmpA transcripts, encoding
HCO3 – transporters, show particularly strong induction
by CO2 (Fig. 15.12). By contrast, the transcript for the
constitutive low-affinity CO2 transporter, ndhF4, shows no
induction.
Instead of carboxysomes, some phototrophs possess alternative systems of CO2 uptake and concentration adapted to different levels of CO2. For example,
the purple phototroph Rhodobacter sphaeroides has
two unlinked operons, each encoding a different set of
CO2 fixation genes, called form I and form II. Form I
and form II each encodes all the key enzymes, such as
Rubisco. When CO2 is limiting, form I enzymes work
best; when CO2 levels are saturating, form II enzymes
work best.

To Summarize
■

■

The Calvin cycle fixes CO2 by reductive condensation
with ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The Calvin cycle is used
by cyanobacteria and chloroplasts and by some lithotrophs and photoheterotrophs.

15.3

CO2 Fixation: Diverse
Pathways

We have seen how oxygenic phototrophs and some lithoautotrophs fix CO2 by the Calvin cycle. Other bacteria, however, fix CO2 by alternative means (see Table 15.1). From
the standpoint of evolution and phylogenetic distribution,
the most ancient pathways are the reductive, or reverse,
TCA cycle of anaerobic phototrophs and the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway of methanogens. Diverse kinds of CO2
fixation play essential roles in soil, aquatic, and wetland
ecosystems, as well as in the digestive systems of animals
such as cattle.

The Reductive, or Reverse, TCA Cycle

All major groups of organisms run the TCA cycle, or
some part of it (discussed in Section 13.6). Most of the
individual reaction steps of the TCA cycle are reversible
because each has a relatively small ΔG of reaction. Thus,
the steps that release CO2 in the forward direction may
assimilate small amounts of CO2 in the reverse direction.
Furthermore, all organisms, including humans, fix small
amounts of CO2 through special reactions that regenerate TCA cycle intermediates. These regeneration steps
are called anaplerotic reactions. Common anaplerotic
reactions are the formation of oxaloacetate from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), catalyzed by PEP carboxylase;
and the formation of malate from pyruvate, catalyzed by
malic enzyme.
In some anaerobic bacteria and archaea, the entire TCA
cycle functions in “reverse,” reducing CO2 to generate

The coenzyme A is recycled as the acetyl group enters
biosynthesis. For example, acetyl-CoA can assimilate
another CO2 with reduction to pyruvate. Pyruvate then
builds up to glucose and related sugars by gluconeogenesis
(reverse glycolysis), with expenditure of ATP and NADPH.
Alternatively, acetyl-CoA can enter biosynthetic pathways
to produce fatty acids or amino acids.

CHAPTER 15

Unlike the Calvin cycle, the reverse TCA cycle provides
several different molecular intermediates that can assimilate
CO2. Here are the key steps:
■

Succinyl-CoA assimilates CO2 to form 2-oxoglutarate
(alpha-ketoglutarate).

■

2-Oxoglutarate assimilates CO2 to form isocitrate.

■

Acetyl-CoA (produced by the reverse TCA cycle) assimilates CO2 to form pyruvate.

Each CO2 assimilation requires one or more reduction steps. 2-Oxoglutarate is reduced by the protein ferredoxin (FdH 2). FdH 2 also mediates acetyl-CoA reduction
to pyruvate. Other reduction steps may be accomplished by
NADPH or NADH.

The Acetyl-CoA Pathway

Yet another route for CO2 assimilation into acetyl-CoA
and pyruvate is the reductive acetyl-CoA pathway
(Fig. 15.14). In the acetyl-CoA pathway, two CO2 molecules are condensed through converging pathways to form
the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA. The acetyl-CoA pathway is

used by anaerobic soil bacteria, such as Clostridium thermoaceticum, and by most autotrophic sulfate reducers, such
as Desulfobacterium autotrophicum. It also provides the
main source of biomass for methanogens. Most of the CO2
absorbed by methanogens is used to yield energy by reducing CO2 to methane (discussed in Chapter 14). However,
5% of the CO2 absorbed by a methanogen enters the acetylCoA pathway for biosynthesis, generating the entire biomass of the organism.
The substrates and ultimate products of the acetyl-CoA
pathway are the same as those of the reverse TCA cycle,
except that the reducing agent is H 2 instead of NADPH.
The acetyl-CoA pathway is slightly more efficient than the
TCA cycle, requiring one less ATP:
2CO2 + ATP + 4H 2 + HS-CoA →
CH3CO-S-CoA + 3H 2O + ADP + Pi
Nevertheless, the order of the pathway and its intermediate
compounds are completely different from those of the TCA
cycle. The reductive acetyl-CoA pathway is linear, with no
recycled intermediates.

malonyl-CoA (step 1). Reduction by 3 NADPH and condensation with
a second HCO3– ultimately lead to malyl-CoA (steps 2–4). In step
5, malyl-CoA is cleaved to yield glyoxylate plus acetyl-CoA, which
reenters the cycle. Glyoxylate condenses with a third HCO3– to form

CHAPTER 15

One place where methanogens fix CO2 and release methane is the bovine rumen, or digestive fermentation chamber (see Chapter 21). Within the rumen, bacteria convert
cattle feed into CO2 and H 2, and methanogens divert a significant portion of these gases into methane. The methane
then escapes through burping and flatulence. If methanogen growth could be prevented, the CO2 and H 2 could be
fixed by other microbes into fermentation acids assimilated
by the rumen. Beef production would then release less of
the greenhouse gas methane.

The 3-Hydroxypropionate Cycle

The green photoheterotroph Chloroflexus aurantiacus fixes
CO2 yet another way: by the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle
(Fig. 15.15A). Chloroflexus bacteria are filamentous thermophiles that absorb light at longer wavelengths than cyanobacteria and often grow below cyanobacteria in thick mats
of biofilm (Fig. 15.15B). The 3-hydroxypropionate cycle is
also used by archaea, such as the thermoacidophile Acidianus
brierleyi and the aerobic sulfur oxidizer Sulfolobus metallicus.
In the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, CO2 is fixed by acetylCoA into 3-hydroxypropionate (Fig. 15.15A). Acetyl-CoA
condenses with hydrated CO2 (bicarbonate ion, HCO3 –)
and is reduced by 2 NADPH to 3-hydroxypropionate.
Condensation with a second molecule of HCO3 – forms
methylmalonyl-CoA, followed by several intermediates to
malyl-CoA. These intermediates were detected by [14C]
acetate incorporation into the metabolism of Chloroflexus
(Fig. 15.15C). The intermediates were separated by high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
Malyl-CoA releases a molecule of acetyl-CoA to renew
the cycle, plus glyoxylate. Glyoxylate condenses with a third
HCO3 – to form pyruvate, which enters standard routes for
biosynthesis of sugars and amino acids. Thus, in all, the
cycle fixes three molecules of CO2 into one molecule of
pyruvate. Pyruvate then serves as a substrate to build carbohydrates and amino acids.

BIOSYNTHESIS

Biosynthesis of Fatty
Acids and Polyketides

The biosynthesis of cell parts begins with small, versatile
substrates such as acetyl-CoA. Acetyl-CoA is a product of
catabolic pathways such as glycolysis and benzoate catabolism (see Sections 13.5 and 13.6). The acetyl group also
forms anabolically from the reverse TCA cycle (Fig. 15.13).
A key pathway of biosynthesis assembles acetyl-CoA into
fatty acids. Fatty acids then condense with glycerol to form
the phospholipids of cell membranes and the lipid components of envelope proteins. Fatty acid biosynthesis provides
targets for antimicrobial drugs such as triclosan, an inhibitor of enoyl-ACP reductase. Related condensation pathways
yield materials such as polyesters and polyketide antibiotics,
such as tetracycline.
The repeating form of fatty acids, polyketides, and polyesters enables long-chain molecules to be synthesized with
a relatively small number of different enzymes. By contrast, other cell components, such as amino acids, have
more complex nonrepeating structures whose biosynthetic
enzymes require long operons (presented in Section 15.6).

Fatty Acids Are Built from
Repeating Units

Fatty acids exemplify the construction of cell components
from repeating units (Fig. 15.16). The construction of
molecules based on repeating units requires a cyclic pathway that feeds its products back repeatedly as substrates
for further synthesis. The advantage of a cyclic process is
that large polymers can be made with a limited number of
enzymes; for example, the mycolic acids of Mycobacterium
tuberculosis are extended to lengths of over 100 carbons.
While fatty acid structures used by cells include many
different forms (discussed in Chapter 3), their synthesis
always begins with the successive addition of two-carbon
acetyl groups. Thus, most fatty acids contain an even number of carbon atoms.
The fatty acid synthase complex. The cyclic process of

fatty acid synthesis is managed by the fatty acid synthase
complex. The complex contains all the enzymes and component binding proteins bound together in proximity, so
that all steps proceed in one place without “losing” the
unfi nished molecule. The main bacterial version of this
complex is designated FASII. All of the components are
essential for viability and thus are potential drug targets.
Analogous multienzyme complexes are used by actinomycete bacteria to synthesize other long-chain products, such
as polyketide antibiotics.

Activation of acetyl-CoA. Most acetyl groups within the

cell are “tagged” with coenzyme A (CoA), a cofactor that
directs acetate into catabolic pathways such as the TCA
cycle. To redirect acetyl groups into fatty acid biosynthesis,
acetyl-CoA molecules are fi rst tagged at the “back end” by
condensation with CO2 (Fig. 15.16A, step 1), catalyzed
by acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The addition of CO2 in this step
does not count as carbon fi xation, because the CO2 added
does not permanently add to the carbon skeleton. Instead,
like phosphate or CoA, the CO2 exists to be displaced when
its function is no longer required. The CO2-tagged acetylCoA is called malonyl-CoA. The coenzyme A is replaced by
acyl carrier protein (ACP), making malonyl-ACP (step 2).

acid. Units of acetyl-CoA are
carboxylated to malonyl-CoA,
and then successively condense
to form the long chain of a fatty acid. Each two-carbon unit requires
reduction by 2 NADPH. B. An alkene “kink” can be left unsaturated
during chain extension. The double bond then forms between the
third and fourth carbons, rather than the second and third. In this
position, the double bond escapes reduction as the chain lengthens
through subsequent cycles of malonyl addition.

(Fig. 15.16A), malonyl-ACP hooks onto the head of an
acetyl-ACP or a longer-growing chain. The process of
hooking onto the new unit involves displacement of CO2
from the back end of malonyl-ACP, which replaces ACP
from the front end of the growing chain. The growing
chain now contains a ketone (at carbon 3, from the former acetyl group). The ketone is reduced by NADPH and
dehydrated, forming an alkene (C =C, unsaturated double bond between adjacent carbons 2 and 3). The alkene is
further reduced by a second NADPH (steps 4–6). In all,
the chain gains 4H+ + 4e – and is now fully hydrogenated
(saturated).
Once hydrogenated, the chain is ready to take on the
next malonyl-ACP, which, as before, loses CO2 and replaces
the ACP from the front of the growing chain (return to
step 3). Successive addition can continue many times to
build a saturated fatty acid.

CHAPTER 15
Unsaturation. Certain fatty acids require unsaturated “kinks”

in the chain (alkenes) to serve a structural purpose, such as to
increase the fluidity of the membrane. Unsaturation can be
generated during a cycle of elongation (Fig. 15.16A, step 5).
During the first four cycles of acetyl addition, an alkene bond
forms between the second and third carbons of the fatty acid.
After the fifth two-carbon addition, however, a special dehydratase enzyme generates the alkene double bond between
the third and fourth carbons (Fig. 15.16B). This alkene fails
to be hydrogenated further. Instead, several additional malonyl units are added, generating a long-chain fatty acid with a
kink of a cis double bond.
Regulation of fatty acid synthesis. The synthesis of fatty

acids consumes enormous quantities of reducing energy;
thus, cells must regulate it to avoid waste. From a structural standpoint, production of fatty acids incorporated
into membranes must be balanced with growth of the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the many different variants of fatty
acids are regulated in response to particular environmental
needs. Some mechanisms of regulation include:
■

Acetyl-CoA carboxylase represses its own transcription. Transcription of an operon encoding two subunits
of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (AccB, AccC) is repressed
by one of its subunits, protein AccB. As AccB increases
in concentration, it binds the promoter of the accBC
operon, repressing further transcription. Thus, initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis (Fig. 15.16A, step 1) is
always limited by the amount of AccB and AccC enzyme
subunits that are present.

■

Starvation blocks fatty acid biosynthesis. Starvation
for carbon sources blocks fatty acid biosynthesis through
the “stringent response.” Blockage is mediated by the
polyphosphorylated nucleotide ppGpp (guanosine tetraphosphate), the global regulator of the stringent
response (discussed in Section 10.2).

■

Temperature regulates fatty acid composition. Bacterial fatty acid composition is regulated by environmental
factors such as temperature. In E. coli, low temperature
favors unsaturated fatty acids because they are less rigid
and maintain membrane flexibility. Low temperature
induces expression of the gene fabA encoding the dehydratase enzyme that desaturates the fatty acid bond. As
the dehydratase activity is increased, more unsaturated
fatty acids are made.

Thought Question

15.5 For a given species, uniform thickness of a cell membrane requires uniform chain length of its fatty acids. How do
you think chain length may be regulated?

■

BIOSYNTHESIS

■

585

Cyclic pathways of elongation comparable to fatty acid
biosynthesis are used to build other kinds of polymers for
energy storage. For example, many bacteria synthesize
polyesters such as polyhydroxybutyrate. The term “polyester” indicates the multiple ester groups that are formed
by repeated esterification of the carboxylic acid group of
the chain with the hydroxyl group of a new alkanoate unit.
Polyesters are insoluble in water, so they collect as storage
granules within the bacterial cell, ready to release stored
energy when needed. Polyester granules are synthesized
by human pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila, the
cause of legionellosis. Polyester storage helps L. pneumophila survive in water sources such as air-conditioning
units. Commercially, polyesters produced by soil bacteria
such as Ralstonia eutropha are used to manufacture biodegradable surgical sutures.

Polyketide Antibiotics

The cyclic biosynthesis of fatty acids provides clues to
the biosynthesis of a famous family of antibiotics, the
polyketides. A well-known polyketide is erythromycin, a
broad-spectrum antibiotic prescribed for bacterial pneumonia and chlamydia infections (Fig. 15.17). Erythromycin
blocks bacterial translation at the step of peptide elongation
(see Chapter 8). Polyketides are secondary products produced by actinomycetes, as discussed earlier.
The synthesis of polyketide antibiotics involves cyclic
elongation by an enormous enzyme complex called a modular enzyme, which consists of multiple modules that add
similar but nonidentical units to a growing chain. Like
fatty acids, polyketides are built by the successive condensation of malonyl-ACP units, but each malonyl group carries a unique extension, or R group, instead of a CO2. In
erythromycin, the R groups are all methyl groups. In other
polyketides, the R groups range from hydroxyl groups and
amides to aromatic rings, some of which undergo secondary reactions and interconnections.
How is the order of different R groups determined? The
modular enzyme contains a series of active sites, or modules, each of which catalyzes the addition of one of a series
of units. Each module contains all the enzyme activities
needed to add the unit and recognizes a unit with one specific R group. The modular polyketide synthase may consist of a single protein with a series of domains, or it may
consist of a complex of several protein subunits. Either the
multidomain enzyme or the complex acts as an assembly
line to generate the specific polyketide.
Figure 15.17A and B show the chain extension synthesis of a polyketide. The initial two domains of enzyme 1
are acyltransferase (AT) and an acyl carrier protein (ACP)
domain, analogous to the ACP of fatty acid biosynthesis
but specialized to accept one component of the polyketide.

The acyltransferase transfers the acyl group (R 1-acetyl)
from R 1-acetyl-CoA onto the ACP, with release of coenzyme A (HS-CoA). The R 1-acetyl is then transferred to a
ketosynthase domain (KS).
Meanwhile, a malonyl group with its own R group
(R 2-malonyl) has been transferred by a second AT onto the
second ACP domain (Fig. 15.17B). The R 1-acetyl group
then leaves KS and condenses with R 2-malonyl-ACP, releasing CO2. The R 1R 2 acyl chain subsequently undergoes a
series of extensions by R-malonyl groups (Fig. 15.17C). For
erythromycin, all R groups are methyl; other polyketides
have R groups that are more complex. The initial AT and
ACP domains constitute a “loading module” for the first
acyl group, whereas subsequent sets of domains constitute
“extender modules” that each add a different R-malonyl
group. Extender modules can include secondary activities
such as dehydratase (DH; removes OH) and ketoreductase

(KR; hydrogenates a ketone to OH). In principle, the modular approach can construct a limitless range of products
with diverse antibiotic properties.
Elongation of the polyketide is terminated by thioesterase (TE), which hydrolyzes the thioester bond to the final
ACP. This polyketide chain is an erythromycin precursor.
The precursor requires additional enzymes (not shown)
to add extra components, including two sugars (glycosylation). Sugar addition completes the erythromycin.
Another remarkable class of antibiotics formed on modular enzymes consists of polypeptides made without a ribosome. An example of a nonribosomal peptide antibiotic is
ristocetin (see the Current Research Highlight). The biosynthesis of an important nonribosomal peptide antibiotic,
vancomycin, is presented in eTopic 15.4. Modular enzyme
biosynthesis of peptide antibiotics offers exciting prospects
for the design of new drugs (see Special Topic 15.1).

The growing acyl chain is hydrogenated. Each added
unit is hydrogenated by two molecules of NADPH,
unless an unsaturated kink is required.
Some fatty acids are partly unsaturated. An unsaturated kink may be generated by a special dehydratase,
which generates the alkene double bond between the
third and fourth carbons.
Fatty acid biosynthesis is regulated by the levels of
acetyl-CoA carboxylase and by the stringent response to
carbon starvation. Bond saturation is regulated by temperature and other environmental factors.

Note:

Bacteria and archaea play essential roles in global cycling
of nitrogen, sulfur, and phosphorus. The geochemical cycling of
these elements is discussed in Chapter 22.

Polyesters for energy storage are synthesized by cyclic
elongation of alkanoates.

Nitrogen Assimilation

To fix nitrogen into biomass, bacteria or archaea must
reduce the nitrogen completely to ammonia (NH3). At
pH 7, ammonia is mostly protonated to ammonium ion
(NH4+). Unlike carbon, nitrogen rarely appears in oxidized
form in complex biomolecules. Inorganic forms, such as
nitric oxide (NO), are used as defense mechanisms against
invading pathogens (see Chapter 23) or as signaling molecules. In macromolecules, however, virtually all the nitrogen is reduced; organic compounds containing oxidized
nitrogen are generally toxic.
While N2 is the ultimate source and sink of biospheric
nitrogen, several oxidized or reduced forms are found in the
environment, produced by living organisms (Fig. 15.18).
Most free-living bacteria can acquire nitrate (NO3 –) or
nitrite (NO2 –) for reduction to ammonium ion. Even
nitrogen-fixing legume symbionts, such as Rhizobium, can
use nitrate.

Polyketide antibiotics are synthesized by modular
enzymes. Nonribosomal peptide antibiotics are also
made by modular enzymes.

Nitrogen Fixation
and Regulation

The synthesis of amino acids, cell walls, and other cofactors requires an additional element we have not yet considered—namely, nitrogen. In principle, nitrogen should
be more accessible to cells than carbon is, since nitrogen
4H+ + 3e–

3H2O

BIOSYNTHESIS

gas (N2) comprises more than three-quarters of our
atmosphere. In fact, however, N2 , with its triple bond, is
one of the most stable molecules in nature. An enormous
input of energy is required to reduce nitrogen to ammonia for assimilation into carbon skeletons. Early in evolution, all cells may have fixed their own N2 , but today
only certain species of bacteria and archaea retain the
ability. All other organisms depend on reduced or oxidized forms of nitrogen, which ultimately derive from
N2. Thus, all living organisms, directly or indirectly,
depend on N2-fixing prokaryotes within the biosphere
(discussed in Chapters 21 and 22). Nitrogen limits
microbes in many ecosystems, such as aquatic algae in
lakes.

Fatty acid biosynthesis involves successive condensation of malonyl-ACP groups formed from acetyl groups
tagged with acyl carrier protein (ACP) and a carboxylate.
Each successive malonyl group is transferred onto the
growing acyl chain, with release of CO2.

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

SPECIAL TOPIC 15.1- - Mining a Bacterial Genome for Peptide Antibiotics
Bacteria synthesize a vast array of peptide products that serve
the functions of development, communication, and combat.
These peptides have unique modifications that depart from
the standard 20 amino acid residues. Some peptides are
translated by ribosomes and then modified, whereas others,
the nonribosomal peptides, are synthesized entirely by modular enzymes comparable to those that make polyketides.
Nonribosomal peptides include powerful antibiotics such as
vancomycin (eTopic 15.4) and immunosuppressant drugs
such as cyclosporine.
As resistance evolves, in our arms race with pathogens,
we always need more new antibiotics. The stendomycins
are an emerging class of lipopeptides (peptides attached
to lipid) that have antifungal activity (Fig. 1). Where do we
find them? We can mine the genomes of the ever-evolving
strains of bacteria in our environment, which undergo their
own arms races with each other. The challenge is (1) to
detect previously unknown antibiotics within cells—a chemical “needle in the haystack”—and (2) to reveal the genes
encoding their biosynthetic enzymes. The genes can then
be cloned in an engineered fermenter strain (discussed in
Chapter 16).
So which clues come first—the peptide or the biosynthetic genes? Either the peptide or the gene sequence may
offer a clue, which then serves to interrogate the other side.

A multistep interactive approach between peptide and gene
was devised by Pieter Dorrestein and colleagues at UC San
Diego (Fig. 2). The approach is called peptidogenomics. Figure 3 outlines the peptidogenomic approach that identified
the structure and biosynthetic genes for stendomycin I–VI, an
antifungal agent produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces
hygroscopicus.
Stendomycin was the first antibiotic identified in S. hygroscopicus by a version of mass spectrometry called MALDI-TOF
(matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization–time-offlight). In the MALDI technique, a UV laser beam is trained on
a sample embedded in a chemical matrix. A thin portion of
sample plus matrix is “desorbed”—that is, ionized—and the
ions are taken up into the mass spectrometer. The “time of
flight” into the detector offers a measure of the size of the
ionized molecules.
For Dorrestein’s work, the MALDI laser was aimed at a
matrix-embedded colony of S. hygroscopicus. Fragments of
thousands of molecules were generated, among them components with sizes characteristic of certain uniquely modified
amino acids that appear only in nonribosomal peptides, such
as dehydroalanine. In addition, the fragments predicted the
existence of a peptide containing eight amino acids, whose
sequence did not match any translated sequence within
the S. hygroscopicus genome. The data were consistent

synthesize one version of the peptide: Gly-Val-Ile-Ala-ThrThr-Val-Val. This peptide proved to be the backbone of the
lipopeptide stendomycin I–VI (Fig. 1). Note that in the mature
lipopeptide, other enzymes have catalyzed various modifications, such as an ester linkage between the carboxyl terminus
and the hydroxyl group of a threonine residue.
The full structure of stendomycin I–VI was identified and
confirmed by back-and-forth testing between models predicted by the mass spectrometry fragments and by gene
cluster analysis. The method is now being used to identify
many other peptide products. We can only hope that our rate
of drug discovery outpaces the rate of resistance arising in
pathogens.

for energy, as discussed in Chapter 14. For example, anaerobic respirers convert nitrate and nitrite to N2 (denitrification), whereas lithotrophs oxidize NH4+ to nitrite and
nitrate (nitrification). An important consequence of nitrification is that most of the commercial ammonia fertilizer
spread on agricultural fields is soon oxidized by lithotrophs
to nitrates and nitrites. High concentrations of nitrates in
water are harmful because they combine with hemoglobin, generating a form that cannot take up oxygen. When
infants drink water with high nitrite, they may become ill
with “blue baby syndrome.”

Nitrogen Fixation: Early Discoveries

The first nitrogen fixers, discovered by Martinus Beijerinck and colleagues in the late 1800s, were soil and
wetland bacteria such as Beggiatoa and Azotobacter. Species of Rhizobium were discovered to fix nitrogen as
endosymbionts of leguminous plants (see Chapter 21).
For several decades, it was believed that N2 was fixed
only by a few special bacteria in the soil or in symbiotic
plant bacteria. But in the 1940s, Martin Kamen and colleagues noticed that phototrophs such as Rhodospirillum
rubrum produce hydrogen gas—a known by-product of
nitrogen fixation. Nitrogen fixation was hard to demonstrate reliably in the laboratory because at that time
researchers did not know that in R. rubrum, nitrogen
fixation is repressed by the presence of alternative nitrogen sources, such as ammonia. When traces of ammonia and other nitrogen sources were eliminated, Kamen’s
student Herta Bregoff found that these photosynthetic
bacteria actually fix nitrogen.
Nitrogen is now known to be fixed by most phototrophic bacteria (green and purple bacteria, as well as

cyanobacteria) and by many archaea. Marine cyanobacteria fix a large proportion of both the nitrogen and carbon dioxide assimilated by our biosphere. To fix N2,
aquatic cyanobacteria such as Anabaena develop special
cells called heterocysts, in which photosynthesis is turned
off to maintain anaerobic conditions (Fig. 15.19). Land
ecosystems require nitrogen-fixing bacteria and archaea in
the soil, often in mutualistic relationships with plants. For
example, the bacterium Bradyrhizobium japonicum associates with the roots of soybean plants, causing them to
grow nodules. The nodules contain “bacteroids,” forms
of the bacteria that grow within the root cells. The bacteroids release extra nitrogen into the soil; for this reason,
farmers alternate soy crops with nitrogen-intensive crops
such as corn. Nitrogen-fixing mutualism is discussed in
Chapter 21.
Bacterial nitrogen fixation, however, has not sufficed to
drive modern high-yield agriculture. Industrial nitrogen
fixation uses the Haber process, in which nitrogen gas is
hydrogenated by methane (natural gas) to form ammonia,
under extreme heat and pressure. Scientists estimate that
the Haber process reduces more atmospheric N2 than all
of Earth’s other processes combined. While this amount
of nitrogen represents a small fraction of the atmosphere,
the environmental effects are huge, polluting waterways
and causing marine areas of hypoxia called “dead zones”
(discussed in Chapters 21 and 22). The anthropogenic
(human-caused) influx of nitrogen into the biosphere is an
astonishing example of the influence of human society on
our planet.

The Mechanism of Nitrogen Fixation

In living cells, nitrogen fixation is an enormously energyintensive process. The mechanism is largely conserved
across species:
N2 + 8H+ + 8e – + 16 ATP → 2NH3 + H 2 + 16 ADP + 16 Pi

CHAPTER 15

The electrons are donated by NADH, H2, or
pyruvate, or obtained through photosynthesis.
The total energy investment includes approximately 3 ATP-equivalents per 2e –, plus 16 ATP
molecules as shown. That makes 12 + 16 = 28
ATP in all—a large part of the energy gained
from oxidation of glucose. The production of
H2 is surprising, as it consumes extra ATP.
Hydrogen loss results from initiating the cycle
of nitrogen reduction (discussed shortly). Some
bacteria have secondary reactions to reclaim the
lost hydrogen with part of its lost energy.

Nitrogenase reaction mechanism. The overall

conversion of nitrogen gas to two molecules of
ammonia is catalyzed in four cycles by nitrogenase, an enzyme highly conserved in nearly
all nitrogen-fi xing species. Nitrogenase probably evolved once in a common ancestor of all
nitrogen-fi xing organisms.
The mechanism of nitrogenase is of intense interest to
agricultural scientists because of the potential benefits
of improving efficiency of plant growth and of extending nitrogen-fixing symbionts to nonleguminous plants
such as corn. In 1960, scientists at the DuPont laboratory
first isolated the nitrogenase complex from a bacterium,
Clostridium pasteurianum. They measured its activity
by incorporating heavy-isotope nitrogen gas, 15N2, into
15
NH3. Since then, the detailed structure of nitrogenase
has been solved (Fig. 15.20).
The active nitrogenase complex includes two kinds of
subunits encoded by different genes: Fe protein (shaded
green in Fig. 15.20), containing a [4Fe-4S] center;
and FeMo protein (shaded cyan), containing iron and
molybdenum. The Fe protein contains a typical [4Fe4S] structure to facilitate electron transfer. As we learned
in Chapter 14, metal atoms help to transfer electrons
because their orbitals are closely spaced and transitions
between these orbitals involve relatively small amounts of
energy. The electrons are funneled through a second Fe-S
cluster (the P cluster) to the FeMo (iron-molybdenum)
cluster. The FeMo cluster is an unusual structural characteristic of nitrogenase, in which trios of sulfur atoms
alternate with trios of iron atoms. One end of the cluster
is capped with another iron, and the other end is capped
with an atom of molybdenum (Mo). A consequence of
the nitrogenase structure is that most nitrogen-fixing

Nitrogen fixation by nitrogenase. The enzyme nitrogenase successively reduces nitrogen by electron transfer, ATP

hydrolysis, and H+ incorporation.

Four cycles of reduction. Nitrogen fi xation requires four
reduction cycles through nitrogenase (Fig. 15.21).
To initiate the first cycle of N2 reduction, 2e – from an
electron donor such as NADH or H2 are transferred by a
ferredoxin to Fe protein. The reduced Fe protein transfers
each electron to the FeMo center, with energy supplied by
four molecules of ATP (Fig. 15.21, step 1). The FeMo protein binds 2H+, which are reduced to H2 (step 2). Only then
does N2 bind to the active site, by displacing the H2 (step 3).
In the next reduction cycle, two electrons are transferred
to Fe protein, where they reduce the iron. The reduced Fe
protein transfers each electron to the FeMo center, near the
binding site for N2. The electron transfer requires expenditure of 2 ATP per electron, or 4 ATP per 2e –. Two hydrogen ions join the N2 and receive the two electrons, forming
HN=NH.
A third pair of electrons enters the Fe protein, which
then joins another 2H+, reducing N2 to H 2N–NH 2. The
cycle again requires hydrolysis of 4 ATP. A final cycle of
electron transfer and H+ uptake reduces H 2N–NH 2 to
2NH3. At typical cytoplasmic pH values (near pH 7), NH3
is protonated to NH4+.

The loss of H 2 during nitrogen fixation is puzzling
because it represents lost energy in a highly energy-intensive process. The actual fate of the H 2 varies among species. Klebsiella pneumoniae, a Gram-negative organism in
which nitrogen regulation has been much studied, gives off
the H 2 without further reaction. On the other hand, Azotobacter uses an irreversible hydrogenase enzyme to convert H 2 back to 2H+ and recover the transferred electrons.
In leguminous rhizobial symbionts such as Sinorhizobium
species, H 2 recovery varies surprisingly among strains and
can affect the efficiency of plant growth.
Nitrogen fixation is expensive, both in terms of protein
synthesis and in terms of reducing energy and ATP. Even
bacteria capable of nitrogen fixation repress the process
in the presence of other nitrogen sources, such as nitrate
(NO3 –), nitrite (NO2 –), ammonia (NH3), and nitrogenous
organic molecules acquired from dead cells.

Anaerobiosis and N2 Fixation

The reductive action of nitrogenase is extremely sensitive
to oxygen because of the large reducing power needed to

Protective proteins. Aerobic Azotobacter
species synthesize protective proteins that
stabilize nitrogenase and prevent attack by
oxygen. For rhizobia, on the other hand,
the plant hosts produce leghemoglobin
(named for “legume” plants), a form of
hemoglobin that sequesters oxygen away
from the bacteria.

has made important discoveries about
NtrC and other forms of nitrogen
regulation in the Gram-negative soil

B. When cellular levels of NH4+ are
low, NtrC is phosphorylated and activates expression of nifLA. Expression
is coactivated by the nitrogen
starvation sigma factor, sigma-54.
The NifA protein (and sigma-54)
activates expression of nif genes
encoding nitrogenase. When
oxygen levels are high, however,
nitrogen fixation cannot occur, so NifA
is blocked by binding NifL. (Numbers

Specialized cells for N2 fixation. Filamentous cyanobacteria develop specialized
nitrogen-fixing cells called heterocysts (see
Fig. 15.19). The heterocysts lose their photosynthetic capacity entirely and specialize in
nitrogen fixation. Heterocyst development
is directed by a complex genetic program
induced by nitrogen starvation. In natural
environments, the heterocysts leak organic
acids that attract heterotrophic bacteria,
which use up all the oxygen around the heterocyst, generating ideal anaerobic conditions for nitrogen fixation.

make NH4+. Thus, cells can fix nitrogen only
in an anaerobic environment. This is no problem for anaerobes. But oxygenic phototrophs
such as cyanobacteria face an obvious problem, as do bacterial symbionts of oxygenic
plants. Aerobic and oxygenic organisms have
developed several solutions to the problem of
fixing nitrogen in aerobic environments:

■

Nitrogen fixation costs substantial energy, and therefore
the process is regulated with extraordinary fine tuning.
Multiple factors determine the expression of genes encoding nitrogenase (nifHDKTY) and other nitrogen-fixation
proteins. Oxygen represses the expression of nif genes
because nitrogenase is inactivated by oxygen; and high
NH4+ depresses expression because enough fixed nitrogen is already available to the cell. Responses are mediated
by several molecular regulators, including a nitrogen starvation sigma factor (sigma-54) and the NtrB-NtrC twocomponent signal transduction system. (Sigma factors and
two-component regulators are discussed in Chapter 10.)
The NtrB-NtrC system was dissected in Klebsiella pneumoniae by Sydney Kustu and colleagues at UC Berkeley (Fig. 15.22A). When NH4+ is low (Fig. 15.22B), the
cell needs to fix nitrogen. The nitrogen sensor kinase NtrB

autophosphorylates (obtains a phosphoryl group from ATP).
NtrB-P then phosphorylates NtrC, forming NtrC-P, the
nitrogenase activator. The NtrC-P phosphoprotein binds an
upstream enhancer sequence to activate expression of nifLA,
making NifL and NifA proteins. Expression of nifLA is coactivated by sigma-54. Sigma-54 and the NifA protein together
activate expression of nifHDKTY to make nitrogenase. Thus,
low NH4+ concentration turns on nitrogen fixation.
When cellular levels of NH4+ are high, NtrC remains
unphosphorylated. The nifLA operon is not transcribed,
no activators bind the nifHDKTY promoter, and the nitrogen fixation genes are not expressed.
Nitrogenase activity is stopped by oxygen, so high oxygen
levels block expression of the gene. When oxygen is high,
NifA binds NifL and is prevented from binding the nitrogenase promoter. Low oxygen allows NifA to bind the promoter and express nitrogenase to fix nitrogen. Overall, NtrC
governs response to NH4+, whereas NifA governs response
to oxygen. Being responsive to multiple environmental signals is typical of energy-expensive biosynthetic pathways.

Nitrogenase enzyme includes a protein containing an

complex of molybdenum, iron, and sulfur (FeMo protein). Electrons acquired by Fe protein (with energy from

Biosynthesis of
Amino Acids and
Nitrogenous Bases

Where do microbes obtain amino acids to make their proteins and cell walls, as well as nitrogenous bases to synthesize DNA and RNA? When possible, microbes obtain these
molecules from their environment through membraneembedded transporters. But competition for such valuable
nutrients is high, especially for free-living microbes in soil
or water. Most free-living microbes and plants have the
ability to make all the standard amino acids and bases of
the genetic code, as well as nonstandard variants used for
cell walls and transfer RNAs. We can use microbial biosynthesis of amino acids in the industrial production of food
supplements, for ourselves and for farm animals.

of reducing energy. These compounds pose additional
challenges because of their unique and diversified forms,
which cannot be made by the cyclic processes that generate molecules from repeating units. Synthesis of complex,
asymmetrical molecules such as amino acids requires
many different conversions, each mediated by a different enzyme. Nevertheless, some economy is gained by
an arrangement of branched pathways in which early
intermediates are utilized to form several products
(Fig. 15.23). For example, oxaloacetate is converted to
aspartate, which can be converted to four other amino
acids.
The carbon skeletons of amino acids arise from diverse
intermediates of metabolism (see Fig. 15.23). As in fatty
acid biosynthesis, precursor molecules are channeled into
amino acid biosynthesis by specialized cofactors and reducing energy carriers such as NADPH. Note that certain
amino acids arise directly from key metabolic intermediates
(for example, glutamate from 2-oxoglutarate), whereas others must be synthesized from preformed amino acids (for
example, glutamine, proline, and arginine from glutamate).

ancient in cell evolution than those requiring more complex pathways. Five of these “ancient” amino acids—glutamate, aspartate, valine, alanine, and glycine—are the same
as those detected in meteorites, whose composition resembles that of prebiotic Earth (Fig. 15.24). These same five
amino acids also appear in early-Earth simulation experiments in which methane, ammonia, and water are heated
under reducing conditions and subjected to electrical discharge. Thus, we speculate that the first amino acids that
early cells evolved to make were the same as those that arose
spontaneously in the prebiotic chemistry of our planet.
A more subtle effect of evolution has been to adjust the
amino acid composition of proteins based on the energetic
cost of biosynthesis. Proteins that are secreted or that project outside the cell cannot be recycled; their amino acids
are ultimately lost to the cell. Thus, secreted and externally
projecting proteins have evolved to contain the “cheaper”
amino acids—that is, the amino acids whose synthesis
requires spending fewer molecules of ATP and NADPH.
This effect can be seen in the diagram of a bacterial flagellum and its attached motor, which contains extracellular as
well as cytoplasmic components, colored on a scale based
on biosynthetic “expense” (Fig. 15.25). The external and
secreted components favor less expensive amino acids, compared to the cytoplasmic components.

Assimilation of NH4+ into

The key TCA cycle intermediate 2-oxoglutarate (alphaketoglutarate) incorporates one
molecule of NH4+ at the ketone
to form glutamate. Glutamine
can combine with oxoglutarate
to produce two molecules of
glutamate. These reactions

Assimilation of NH4+

Unlike sugars and fatty acids, amino acids must assimilate another key ingredient: nitrogen. The NH4+ produced by N2 fixation or by nitrate reduction is the key
source of nitrogen for biosynthesis. But NH4+ always
exists in equilibrium with NH3, which is toxic to cells.
Moreover, NH3 travels freely through membranes, making it difficult to store NH4+ within a cell. Deprotonation
to NH3 increases as pH rises; by pH 9.2, deprotonation
reaches 50%. Even at neutral pH, a very small equilibrium
concentration of NH3 can drain NH4+ out of the cell.
Thus, cells avoid storing high levels of NH4+; instead, the
fixed nitrogen is incorporated immediately into organic
products.
2-Oxoglutarate and glutamate condense with NH4+.

In most bacteria, the main route for NH4 + assimilation is the condensation of NH4 + with 2-oxoglutarate
to form glutamate, or with glutamate to form glutamine
(Fig. 15.26). Three key enzymes interconvert these
substrates:
■

+

Glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), actually named for
its reverse activity, condenses NH4+ with 2-oxoglutarate
to form glutamate. The condensation requires reduction
by NADPH.

■

Glutamine synthetase (GS or GlnA) condenses a second NH4+ with glutamate to form glutamine—a process
driven by spending one ATP.

■

Glutamate synthase (GOGAT, glutamine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase) converts 2-oxoglutarate plus
glutamine into two molecules of glutamate. Different
variants of this enzyme use different reducing agents:
NADPH, NADH, or ferredoxin. The NADPH variant
is shown in Figure 15.26.

Through these reactions, all three substrates exchange
amino groups readily. High nitrogen levels induce GDH
to take up NH4+, but repress GS and GOGAT. GS has a

higher affinity than GDH for NH4+. Low nitrogen levels
induce GS (to make glutamine) and GOGAT (to convert
some glutamine to glutamate as needed).
Both glutamate and glutamine contribute an amine,
as well as their carbon skeletons, to the synthesis of other
amino acids in the biosynthetic “tree.” The transfer of
ammonia between two metabolites such as glutamate and
glutamine is called transamination. Many other pairs of
amino acids and metabolic intermediates undergo transamination. For example, glutamate transfers NH3 to oxaloacetate, making aspartate and 2-oxoglutarate; the reaction
can also be reversed. In another example, valine transfers an amine group to pyruvate, generating alanine and
2-ketoisovalerate.

Thought Question

15.6 Suggest two reasons why transamination is advantageous to cells.

Glutamate and Glutamine
Signal Nitrogen Availability

The cellular levels of glutamate and glutamine act as indicators of nitrogen availability. When nitrogen is scarce,
NtrC is phosphorylated to NtrC-P as we saw earlier in Figure 15.22. Along with nitrogenase, NtrC-P up-regulates
expression of glutamine synthetase (Fig. 15.27), as well as
a high-affinity ammonia transporter, and transporters for
organic sources of nitrogen such as amino acids, oligopeptides, and cell wall fragments containing amino sugars. All
these molecules can be “scavenged” to obtain nitrogen for
biosynthesis.
When ammonium ion (NH4+) is abundant, cells store
the nitrogen safely as glutamine, via glutamine synthetase (GlnA) (Fig. 15.27). GlnA uses the energy released
from ATP hydrolysis to assimilate NH4+ into glutamic
acid and produce glutamine. But what if the cell makes
too much active GlnA? Then all of the cell’s glutamate

maintain the balance requires an intricate series of regulators responding to low glutamine or to high glutamine
(Fig. 15.27).
Glutamine acts at the levels of transcription and posttranslational control. Here we describe only a portion of

cell needs to stop making GlnA and inactivate whatever
still remains. To halt glnA transcription, GlnB dephosphorylates NtrB-P, and then NtrB dephosphorylates NtrCP (step 5). NtrC cannot bind the enhancer, and thus glnA
transcription stops.
Meanwhile, GlnB also compels GlnE to add an AMP
to GlnA (adenylylation, step 6). This modification inactivates whatever GlnA remains in the cell. The reaction
is amplified by GlnD, which, under high glutamine,
reverses its reaction, removing UMP from GlnB (step 7).
The result is that ammonium ion no longer condenses
with glutamate, and the glutamate/glutamine ratio is
maintained.

by a complex pathway is arginine (Fig. 15.28). Bacterial
arginine biosynthesis generally involves about a dozen different enzymes distributed among four to eight operons.
Operon expression is regulated by an arginine repressor
that binds the promoter of each operon to prevent transcription in the presence of sufficient arginine for cell
needs. In some species, the arginine repressor also activates

enzymes of arginine catabolism, making the excess amino
acid available as a carbon source.
Arginine biosynthesis. Arginine synthesis begins with the

condensation of glutamate with acetyl-CoA (Fig. 15.28,
step 1), transferring an amino group to the arginine precursor. Three more amino groups (–NH 2) are transferred

CHAPTER 15

subsequently by glutamate, glutamine, and aspartate. A
second glutamate transfers an amino group to the arginine
precursor (step 2), while its own carbon skeleton cycles
back as 2-oxoglutarate (alpha-ketoglutarate). This transfer
of NH4+ between two organic intermediates is an example
of transamination. The original acetyl group from acetylCoA is then hydrolyzed, producing ornithine. Ornithine
is a central intermediate, used by cells to synthesize proline and various polyamines, as well as arginine.

Ornithine receives a third amino group (Fig. 15.28,
step 3) from glutamine via conversion of CO2 to carbamoyl

Aromatic amino acids. The complexity of aromatic amino
acids requires particularly energy-expensive biosynthesis. The number of different enzymes required, however,
is minimized by the presence of a common core pathway
branching to several different amino acids (Fig. 15.29).
The three aromatic amino acids—phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan—each require a common precursor,
chorismate. The pathway to chorismate starts with simple
glycolytic intermediates (phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate), but its synthesis requires 10 enzymes
encoded in a single operon, aroABCDEFGHKL. From
chorismate to phenylalanine or tyrosine requires three additional enzymatic steps. From chorismate to tryptophan,
the most complex amino acid specified by the genetic code,
requires another five enzymes, expressed by trpABCDE.
Thus, at least 15 enzymes encoded by different genes are
required to make tryptophan out of simple substrates.
Not surprisingly, the presence of tryptophan in the cell
represses expression of its own biosynthetic enzymes. Repression of the trp operon includes two mechanisms: the Trp
repressor, effective over moderate to high levels of tryptophan; and an RNA loop mechanism called attenuation, sensitive to lower levels of tryptophan (discussed in Chapter 10).
Attenuation involves the destabilization of the transcription
complex by formation of a specific stem loop on the nascent
trp mRNA. The mechanism of attenuation in E. coli was discovered in 1981 by Charles Yanofsky, winner of a National
Medal of Science in 2003. Several other

Carbamoyl phosphate provides a way to assimilate one
nitrogen plus one carbon into a structure.
The fourth nitrogen is acquired from aspartate in a twostep process requiring ATP release of pyrophosphate (PPi)
(Fig. 15.28, step 4). The release of fumarate, a TCA cycle
intermediate, yields arginine.

Purine synthesis. The hydrolysis of PRPP releases
pyrophosphate, thus spending two high-energy
phosphate bonds. This irreversible reaction drives
–
forward the subsequent reactions to make the
COO
purine (Fig. 15.30, left). To construct the purine,
the pyrophosphate at carbon 1 (C-1) is replaced by
an amine from glutamine. The purine is built up by
addition of a series of single-carbon groups (formyl,
methyl, and CO2) alternating with nitrogens from
glutamine and carbamoyl phosphate. The number
of single-carbon assimilations, including assimilaCO2
tion of CO2, is striking. It may reflect the ancient
origin of the purine synthetic pathway, which
evolved in CO2-fi xing autotrophs.

Biosynthesis of purines and pyrimidines.

Both purines and pyrimidines are built onto ribose 5-phosphate.
Ribose 5-phosphate is directed into purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis by the activating step of ATP → AMP, converting the sugar to
5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). The purine ring is built
up out of successive additions of amines, one-carbon units, plus a
formyl group from formyltetrahydrofolate (formyl-THF). The purine
ring is modified to yield AMP and GMP. Likewise, the pyrimidine ring
is modified to yield CMP or TMP.

Pyrimidine synthesis. The pyrimidine is built by a slightly

different route (Fig. 15.30, right). First, the six-membered pyrimidine ring forms from aspartate plus carbamoyl
phosphate. The pyrimidine ring then displaces the pyrophosphate of PRPP, attaching by a nitrogen to the ribosyl carbon 1. The fi rst pyrimidine built is uracil (as UMP),
which can be converted to cytosine or thymine—as cytidine monophosphate (CMP) or thymidine monophosphate
(TMP), respectively.

Nonribosomal Peptide Antibiotics

In addition to the standard amino acids used by ribosomes, there exist hundreds of different amino acids used
by cells for functions such as the cross-bridges of peptidoglycan (discussed in Chapter 3). Some of these are made
by one-step modification of standard amino acids, such as
epimerization (altering the chirality from L to D) or halogenation with chlorine or fluorine. Others have complex
carbon skeletons, including unsaturated bonds and threemembered rings. Both standard and nonstandard amino
acids are used by actinomycetes to build secondary metabolites with antimicrobial activity. These secondary metabolites are called nonribosomal peptide antibiotics because
their peptide backbone is constructed by an enzyme without ribosomes. Nonribosomal peptide antibiotics are synthesized by modular “assembly-line” enzymes, analogous
to those that build polyketides. An example is vancomycin,
the main antibiotic used against the lethal hospital-borne
pathogen Clostridium difficile. Vancomycin biosynthesis is
presented in eTopic 15.4.
Amino acids also serve as precursors to form larger
structures such as vitamins. For example, bacteria may
assemble eight molecules of glutamic acid into a giant
ring structure called a tetrapyrrole. Tetrapyrrole derivatives include essential cofactors of energy transduction
and biosynthesis, such as chlorophylls, hemes of cytochromes and hemoglobin, and vitamin B12. Tetrapyrrole
biosynthesis and its control by riboswitches are described
in eTopics 15.5 and 15.6.

■

■

Arginine biosynthesis requires multiple steps of NH3
transfer and carbon skeleton condensation.
Aromatic amino acids are built from a common pathway that branches out. Their biosynthesis is regulated
tightly at both transcriptional and translational levels.
Purines are built as nucleotides attached to a ribose
phosphate. Several single-carbon groups are assimilated,
including CO2 —a phenomenon suggesting an ancient
pathway. Pyrimidines are made from aspartate, and then
added onto PRPP.
Nonribosomal peptide antibiotics are built by modular
enzymes analogous to those that build polyketides.

Concluding Thoughts
In living cells, no enzymatic pathway occurs in isolation.
All pathways of energy acquisition and biosynthesis occur
together, sharing common substrates and products. For
example, acetyl-CoA is produced by glycolysis or by fatty
acid degradation; it is then utilized by pathways that synthesize fatty acids, amino acids, and nucleobases. Other
precursors to these molecules arise from the TCA cycle.
At the same time, cells need the TCA cycle to yield energy
through catabolism. The microbial cell regulates these competing needs on an extremely rapid timescale: Within seconds of the disappearance or appearance of a nutrient, such
as an amino acid, its biosynthesis is turned on or shut off.
A given microbe needs to build as much biomass as it
can by the most efficient means available. For a pathogen
growing within a host, this means using preformed host
compounds for rapid growth and replication. Free-living
microbes, however, face intense competition for organic
nutrients; so, in addition, they need to fix essential elements into readily accessible forms. Marine microbes build
complex biological molecules out of single-carbon and single-nitrogen sources, but they also obtain molecules such
as vitamins from their community. In the soil, actinomycetes build antibiotics to eliminate competitors and extract
their nutrients. Those antibiotics offer powerful tools for
human medicine.
Microbial metabolism has many applications in food
preparation and preservation, and in industrial production of pharmaceuticals. Food and industrial microbiology are discussed in Chapter 16. Later, in Chapters 21
and 22, we will see how microbial metabolism contributes
to communities of organisms, and ultimately to Earth’s
global cycles.

drying, salting, smoking, and adding spices, all of which
retard microbial growth. The principles of food microbiology extend to a growing field of industrial microbiology. Industrial microbiology includes the development
of microbial antibiotics and enzymes. Giant fermentors

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

The industrial enzyme lipase B (see the Current Research
Highlight) is just one of many lucrative commercial products of the microbial fermentation industry, a term for
the culturing of microbes to make products for market.
Today, bioprospecting reveals microbial sources for products in remote locations around the world, particularly
those of extreme and unusual environments. Lipase B, with
its wide temperature range, was isolated from Lake Vanda,
a hypersaline Antarctic lake covered by 3 meters of ice. Yet
the deep water of the lake maintains temperature as high
as 25°C, sustained in part by solar heating. Thus, microbes
from this lake experience a wide range of temperatures; and
their enzymes may show activity over a wide temperature
range, which is useful for industrial processes.
While today’s industry involves sophisticated biotechnology, the roots of the fermentation industry reach back to
5000 BCE, the date of pottery jars excavated from a Neolithic mud-brick kitchen in the Zagros Mountains of modern
Iran (Fig. 16.1A). The jars contain residue showing chemical traces of grapes fermented to wine. Besides making wine,
Neolithic people leavened bread, another staple food requiring microbial growth. For thousands of years, microbial fermentation has been a daily part of human life and commerce.
Today, microbial products are made by bacteria grown in
giant fermentation vessels (Fig. 16.1B) (discussed in Section 16.6). Industrial “fermentation” generally uses respiratory metabolism to maximize microbial growth. Microbial
growth drives companies such as DuPont Industrial Biosciences, now earning hundreds of millions of dollars in

industry originated from long-standing microbial associations with human food. Until the relatively recent invention of steam-pressure sterilization, all foods contained live
microbes. Microbial metabolism could spoil food—or it
could improve the food by adding flavor, preserving valuable nutrients, and preventing growth of pathogens. As we
learned in Chapter 1, one of the first great microbiologists,
Louis Pasteur, began his career as a chemist investigating
fermentation in winemaking. In Chapter 16 we see how the
many kinds of microbial biochemistry presented in Chapters 13–15 give rise to the characteristics of food so familiar
to us—from the taste of cheese and chocolate to the rising of bread dough and the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages. Industrial research continues to improve
food through food biochemistry, discovering the molecular basis for the flavor and texture of microbial foods; food
preservation, eliminating undesirable microbial decay by
preservative methods; and food engineering, improving the
quality, shelf life, and taste of microbial foods.

Microbes as Food

Certain kinds of microbial bodies have long been eaten as
food, especially the fruiting bodies of fungi and the fronds
of marine algae. Single-celled algae and cyanobacteria are
also used as food supplements. These microbes can provide
important sources of protein, vitamins, and minerals.

Edible Fungi

In the children’s classic Homer
Price, by Robert McCloskey, settlers
on the Ohio frontier save themselves
from starvation when they discover
“forty-two pounds of edible fungus, in the wilderness a-growin’.”
Fungal fruiting bodies, multicellular reproductive structures that generate spores, are commonly known
as mushrooms (see Chapter 20).
Mushrooms offer a flavorful source
of protein and minerals. The protein
content of edible mushrooms can be
as high as 25% dry weight, comparable to that of whole milk (percent
dry weight), and includes all essential dietary amino acids.
Mushrooms contributed to the
survival of preindustrial humans,

fronds cultured for nori (Fig. 16.3). Nori is best known
for its use in wrapping rice, fish, and vegetables to form
sushi. Another edible alga, kelp, is the source of alginate,
an important food additive (see Section 16.6).
For nori production, the red algae are grown as “seeds,”
or starter cultures, in enclosed tanks. The starter cultures
are then distributed on nets in a protected coastal area, usually an estuary. The cultures grow until they hang heavy
from the nets, when they are harvested for processing into

Fermented Foods:
An Overview

Virtually all human cultures have developed varieties of
fermented foods, food products that are modified biochemically by microbial growth. The purposes of food fermentation include the following:
■

To preserve food. Certain microbes, particularly the
lactobacilli, metabolize only a narrow range of nutrients
before their waste products build up and inhibit further
growth. Typically, the waste fermentation products that
limit growth are carboxylic acids, ammonia (alkaline), or
alcohol. Buildup of these substances renders the product
stable for much longer than the original food substrate.

■

To improve digestibility. Microbial action breaks down
fibrous macromolecules and tenderizes the product,
making it easier for humans to digest. Meat and vegetable products are tenderized by fermentation.

■

To add nutrients and flavors. Microbial metabolism
generates vitamins, particularly vitamin B12, as well as
flavor molecules such as esters and sulfur compounds.

Different societies have devised thousands of different
kinds of fermented foods. Examples are given in Table 16.1.

16.3

Acid- and AlkaliFermented Foods

Many food fermentations produce acids or bases. An acid
or base serves as an effective preservative because the pH
change is unlikely to be reversed, and because animal or
plant bodies grown at near-neutral pH are unlikely to support growth of acidophiles or alkaliphiles, which grow at
extreme pH conditions.

Acid Fermentation of Dairy Products

The conversion of milk to solid or semisolid fermented
products dates far back in human civilization. The practice of milk fermentation probably arose among herders
who collected the milk of their pack animals but had no
way to prevent the rapid growth of bacteria. The milk had
to be stored in a portable container such as the stomach
of a slaughtered animal. After hours of travel, the combined action of lactic acid–producing bacteria and stomach enzymes caused the coagulation of milk proteins into
curd. The curd naturally separated from the liquid portion, called whey. Both curds and whey can be eaten, as in
the nursery rhyme “Little Miss Muffet.” The curds, however, are particularly valuable for their concentrated protein content.
Curd formation. A cheese is any milk product from a mam-

mal (usually cow, sheep, or goat) in which the milk protein coagulates to form a semisolid curd. Curd formation
results from two kinds of processes: acidification, usually
as a result of the microbial production of lactic acid; and
treatment by proteolytic enzymes such as rennet. The curd
may then be separated and processed to varying degrees,
depending on the type of cheese.
How does milk coagulate? The major organic components of cow’s milk are butterfat (about 4% unless
skimmed), protein (3.3%), and the sugar lactose (4.7%).
Milk starts out at about pH 6.6, very slightly acidic. At
this pH, the milk proteins are completely soluble in water;
otherwise they would clog the animal’s udder as the milk
came out. Fermentation generally begins with bacteria

FIGURE 16.6 ■ Bacterial community within Emmentaler
cheese. Bacterial species include Lactobacillus helveticus (rods,
2.0–4.0 µm in length) and Streptococcus thermophilus (cocci).

such as Lactobacillus and Streptococcus (Fig. 16.6). As
bacteria ferment lactose to lactic acid, the pH starts to
decline. The dissociation constant of lactic acid (pK a =
3.9) allows greater deprotonation than with other fermentation products, such as acetate (pK a = 4.8). Thus, lactic
acid rapidly acidifies the milk product to levels that halt
further growth of bacteria. Halting bacterial growth minimizes the oxidation of amino acids, thereby maintaining
food quality.
Milk contains micelles (suspended droplets) of hydrophobic proteins called caseins. As the pH of milk declines
below pH 5, the acidic amino acid residues of caseins
become protonated, eventually destabilizing the tertiary
structure. As the casein molecules unfold (or “denature”),
they expose hydrophobic residues that regain stability by
interacting with other hydrophobic molecules. The intermolecular interaction of caseins generates a gel-like network throughout the milk, trapping other substances, such
as droplets of butterfat. This protein network generates the
semisolid texture of yogurt, a simple product of milk acidified by lactic acid bacteria.
In most kinds of cheese formation, an additional step
of casein coagulation is accomplished by proteases such
as rennet. Rennet derives from the fourth stomach of a
calf, although modern versions are made by genetically
engineered bacteria. Calf rennet includes two proteolytic
enzymes: chymosin and pepsin. Chymosin specifically
cleaves casein into two parts, one of which is charged and
water-soluble, the other hydrophobic. The hydrophobic
portion forms a firmer curd than intact casein and results in
the harder texture of solid cheeses. The water-soluble portion, about one-third of the total casein, enters the whey
and is lost from the curd. Processing of some cheese varieties includes exposure to high temperature, which denatures even the whey protein, so it is retained in the curd.

Varieties of cheese. An extraordinary number of cheese

varieties have been devised (Fig. 16.7). These fall into several categories based on particular steps in their production.

■

■

■

■

■

Soft, unripened cheeses, such as cottage cheese and
ricotta, are coagulated by bacterial action, without rennet. The curd is cooked slightly, and the whey is partly
drained, but their water content is 55% or greater. These
cheeses spoil easily; there are no steps of aging, or
ripening.
Semihard, ripened cheeses, such as Muenster and
Roquefort, include rennet for firmer coagulation, and
the curd is cooked down to a water content of 45%–55%.
The cheese is aged for several months.
Hard cheeses, such as Swiss cheese and cheddar, are
concentrated to even lower water content. Extra-hard
varieties, such as Parmesan and Romano, have a water
content as low as 20%. These cheeses are aged for many
months, even several years.

Brined cheeses, such as feta, are permeated with brine

and develops flavor. Harder cheeses, such as Gouda, may
be brined at the surface.

Cutting of curd

Mold-ripened cheeses are inoculated with mold spores
that germinate and grow during the ripening, or aging,
process to contribute texture and flavor. The mold may
be inoculated on the surface, to form a crust (as in Brie
and Camembert), or it may be spiked deep into the
cheese (as in blue cheese or Roquefort).

these steps, choices of treatment lead to very different varieties. Key steps are illustrated for the example of Gouda
cheese in Figure 16.9.

The pressed curd is then shaped into a mold (Fig. 16.9C),
which determines the ultimate shape of the cheese. Before
ripening (or aging), the cheese may be floated in brine to
generate a rind (Fig. 16.9D); or it may be coated or spiked
with a Penicillium mold. The ripening period then allows
flavor to develop. Texture also changes; for example, where
fermentation has produced CO2, the trapped gas forms
“eyes,” or holes.

Thought Questions

16.3 In an outbreak of listeriosis from unpasteurized cheese,
only the refrigerated cheeses were found to cause disease.
Why would this be the case?
16.4 Cow’s milk contains 4% lipid (butterfat). What happens
to the lipid during cheese production?

FIGURE 16.9 ■ Cheese production. Gouda cheese is produced
at the Henri Willig factory in the Netherlands. A. Milk is poured into a
fermentation tub with a bacterial starter culture and rennet. B. The
milk curd is cut, or “cheddared.” C. The curds are shaped into round
molds and then pressed to remove whey. D. The solidified curds are
floated in brine to form the characteristic rind of Gouda cheese. The
cheese then dries and ripens on the shelf.

modern production includes flash pasteurization (brief
heating to 72°C) (discussed in Chapter 5), although some
traditional cheeses continue to be made from unpasteurized milk. Unpasteurized milk in cheese has been linked
to illness, particularly from Listeria, bacteria that grow at
typical refrigeration temperatures.
The fermenting microbes are added as a starter culture
(Fig. 16.9A). The starter was traditionally derived from
a sample of previous fermentation, in which case the flora
were undefined. Commercial cheese production now uses
defined species. In all but the soft cheeses, bacterial coagulation and curd formation are supplemented by rennet or by
genetically engineered proteases.
The solid curd is then cut, or cheddared (hence the
name “cheddar” cheese) (Fig. 16.9B). The finer the pieces,
the more whey that can be pressed out and the harder the
cheese produced. Curd is then heat treated, with or without the whey; if whey is included, more protein is retained.
Brining at this stage leads to a salty cheese, such as feta.

HENRI WILLIG CHEESE, NETHERLANDS

Flavor generation in cheese. In all fermented foods,

microbial metabolism generates by-products that confer
a characteristic aroma and flavor. In some cases, particular species confer distinctive flavors; for example, Propionibacterium ferments lactate or pyruvate to propionate, a
flavor component of Swiss cheese. All bacteria generate a
surprising range of side reactions, forming trace products
that confer distinctive flavors. For example, while Lactobacillus converts most of the lactose to lactic acid, a small
fraction of the pyruvate is converted to acetoin, acetaldehyde, or acetic acid, which contributes flavor. Most amino
acids are retained intact, but traces are converted to flavorful alcohols, esters, and sulfur compounds (Fig. 16.10).
For example, methanethiol (CH3SH) contributes to the
desirable flavor of cheddar cheese. Lipids are not significantly metabolized by Lactobacillus, but in mold-ripened
cheeses such as Camembert, Penicillium oxidizes a small
amount of the lipids to flavorful methylketones, alcohols,
and lactones.

Acid Fermentation of Vegetables

Many kinds of vegetable products are based on microbial
fermentation. Commercial products marketed globally
include pickles, soy sauce, and sauerkraut. Other products
provide staple foods for particular nations or regions, such
as Indonesian tempeh and Korean kimchi.
Soy fermentation. Soybeans offer one of the best sources
of vegetable protein and are indispensable for the diet of
millions of people, particularly in Southeast Asia. In North
America, soy products are important for vegetarian consumption and as a milk substitute, as well as for animal feed.
But soybeans also contain substances that decrease their
nutritive value. Phytate, or inositol hexaphosphate, chelates

minerals such as iron, inhibiting their
absorption by the intestine. Lectins are
proteins that bind to cell-surface glycoproteins within the human body. At
high concentration, soybean lectins
may upset digestion and induce autoimmune diseases. Soy protease inhibitors
interfere with digestive enzymes chymotrypsin and trypsin, thus decreasing the amount of protein that can be
obtained from soy-based food.
All of these drawbacks of soybeans are diminished by microbial
fermentation, while the protein content remains comparable to that of the
unfermented bean (40%). A variety of
fermented soy foods have been developed. Most soy fermentation involves
mold growth, supplemented by bacteria that contribute vitamins, including
vitamin B12.
A major fermented soy product
is tempeh, a staple food of Indonesia, the world’s fourth-most-populous
country, as well as of other countries
in Southeast Asia (Fig. 16.11). Tempeh consists of soybeans fermented by
Rhizopus oligosporus, a common bread
mold. Besides decreasing the negative
factors of soy, the mold growth breaks
down proteins into more digestible peptides and amino acids. During World War II, tempeh was fed to
American prisoners of war held by
the Japanese. The tempeh was later

Fermentation of cabbage and other vegetables. Vari-

ous leaf vegetables are fermented by traditional societies,
originally as a means of storage over the winter months.
In Europe and North America, the best-known fermented
products include sauerkraut and pickles. Sauerkraut production involves heterolactic fermentation by Leuconostoc
mesenteroides. In heterolactic fermentation, each fermented sugar molecule yields lactic acid, as well as ethanol and carbon dioxide. The culture is used to inoculate
shredded cabbage, which is layered in alternation with salt.
The salt helps limit the number of species and the extent
of microbial growth. A similar brine-enhanced fermentation process is used to pickle cucumbers, olives, and other
vegetables.
An important food based on brine-fermented cabbage
is Korean kimchi (Fig. 16.12). Kimchi is prepared from
Chinese cabbage, salted and layered with radishes, peppers, onions, and other vegetables. The vegetables are covered with a paste of fish, rice, and chili peppers. Pickled
seafoods such as shrimp or oysters may be included. The
entire mixture is stored in a pot, traditionally buried underground for several months. The main fermentation organism is Leuconostoc mesenteroides, although Streptococcus and
Lactobacillus species participate.

credited with saving the lives of prisoners whose dysentery and malnutrition had impaired their ability to absorb
intact proteins.
Tempeh is commonly produced in home-based factories in Indonesia. The soybeans are soaked in water overnight, allowing initial fermentation by naturally present
lactic acid bacteria; in some cases, a crude “starter” may
be introduced from the water of soybeans soaked previously. This pre-fermentation allows bacterial generation
of vitamins and produces mild acid that promotes growth
of mold. The soaked beans are then hulled, cooked, and
cooled to room temperature for inoculation with R. oligosporus spores or with a previous tempeh culture. The
inoculated beans are wrapped in banana leaves or in perforated plastic bags and then allowed to incubate for 2 days.
The mold grows as a white mycelium that permeates the
beans, joining them into a solid cake. The final product
has a mushroom-like taste and is often served fried or
grilled like a hamburger.
Other soy products undergo acid fermentation by the
mold Aspergillus oryzae. The Japanese condiment miso is
made from ground soy and rice, salted and fermented for
2 months by A. oryzae. Soy sauce is made from jiang, a
Chinese condiment similar to miso in which the rice starter
culture is replaced by wheat. The fermentation generates
glutamic acid, a flavor-enhancing compound known popularly in the form of its salt—monosodium glutamate,
or MSG.

Chocolate from Cocoa
Bean Fermentation

Cocoa and coffee beans both require fermentation within
the juice of the fruit before the beans are dried and processed. Chocolate, the product of the cocoa bean, Theobroma cacao (or “food of the gods”), requires one of the
most complex fermentations of any food. For all the commercialization of chocolate production, totaling 2.5 billion
kilos per annum worldwide, no “starter culture” has yet
been standardized to ferment the cocoa bean. The beans
cannot be exported and fermented later; the fermentation
must occur immediately where the beans are harvested
(Fig. 16.13).
The cocoa beans harvested in Africa or South America are heaped in mounds upon plantain leaves for fermentation by indigenous microorganisms, essentially
the same way cocoa has been processed for thousands
of years (Fig. 16.14). The microbial fermentation actually takes place outside the cocoa bean, within the pulp
that clings to the beans after they are removed from the
cocoa fruit. The pulp contains approximately 15% sugars
and pectin (a branched polysaccharide), 2% citric acid,
plus a rich supply of amino acids and minerals. These
nutrients support growth of many kinds of microbes.
Brazilian microbiologist Rosane Schwan (Fig. 16.13A),
of the University of Lavras, Brazil, analyzed the microbial community. She defined three stages of succession: yeasts, lactic acid bacteria, and acetic acid bacteria
(Fig. 16.14B).

pulp (pH 3.6). The acidity favors growth
of yeasts, including Candida, Kloeckera,
and Saccharomyces. The yeasts consume
sugars and citric acid, increasing pH. They
also degrade pectin into glucose and fructose, allowing the pulp to liquefy. As the
liquefied pulp drains, yeast ferments the
remaining sugars to ethanol, CO2, and
mixed acids such as acetate. The reactions release heat, increasing the temperature and accelerating metabolism. But
the acetate, a permeant acid (discussed in
Chapter 13), crosses the yeast cell membrane, where it lowers cell pH and inhibits
growth. The ethanol and acetate also penetrate the bean embryo, killing the cells
and releasing enzymes that generate key
flavor molecules of chocolate.

A.

Lactic acid bacteria (anaerobic). The consumption of citric acid by yeast increases the bean pH to pH 4.2, encouraging growth of lactic acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus
plantarum. Lactobacillus species convert sugars to lactic
acid, as well as acetate and CO2. As fermentable substrates
disappear, however, lactic acid bacteria are inhibited.
Acetic acid bacteria (aerobic). After 2 days, the beans are
turned over and mixed periodically to permit access to oxygen. Aerobic acetic acid bacteria such as Acetobacter now
oxidize the ethanol and acids to CO2. The consumption
of acids neutralizes undesirable acidity. Heat is released,

penetrates the bean, oxidizing key components such as
polyphenols. Polyphenol oxidation generates the brown
color of cocoa and contributes flavor.
After fermentation and pulp drainage, the beans are
dried and roasted. The roasting process completes the
transformation of cocoa substances that contribute flavor. Cocoa liquor and cocoa butter are extracted from the
beans and then recombined with sugar and other components to make “cocoa mass” (Fig. 16.15). The cocoa
mass is stirred for several days to achieve a smooth texture; then it is molded into the decorative forms known

process, no flavor would develop. Schwan and other
researchers are working to develop a defined starter culture, a community of microbes to produce a predictable
high quality of flavor. At present, however, one of the
world’s most refined and highly prized commercial food
products still depends on the indigenous microbial fermentation of cocoa pulp.

Alkaline Fermentation: Natto and Pidan

In Western countries, food-associated fermentation is
almost synonymous with acidification. In Southeast
Asia and in Africa, however, many food products involve
increased pH. Such fermentations typically release small
amounts of ammonia, which raises the pH to about pH 8,

B. natto secretes numerous extracellular enzymes,
including proteases, amylases, and phytases. These
enzymes decrease the undesirable components of soy,
such as phytates and lectins, while liberating more easily
digestible peptides and amino acids. Some of the amino
acids are deaminated, generating ammonia; a well-ventilated natto chamber allows most of this gas to escape. In
addition, B. natto synthesizes extracellular polymers such
as polyglutamate (a peptide chain consisting exclusively of
glutamic acid residues). Polyglutamate generates long elastic strings that bind the beans together. The stretching of
these strings from chopsticks is considered a sign of a good
natto (Fig. 16.16A).
Alkali-fermented vegetables. In Africa, numerous vegetable products are based on alkaline fermentation predominantly by Bacillus species. An example is dawadawa,
a paste of fermented locust beans common in western
Africa. The locust beans are washed and supplemented
with potash (potassium hydroxide) originally obtained
from wood ashes. This addition of alkali retards growth of
bacteria other than Bacillus species, which predominate at
higher pH. The beans are fermented by indigenous bacteria (bacteria already present in the beans). The fermented
beans are sun-dried, releasing most of the ammonia, and
pounded into cakes for storage. Similar alkali-fermented
vegetables include ogiri, from melon seeds, and ugba, from
oil beans.

penetrates the eggshells, raising pH and coagulating the
egg white proteins. The eggs are buried in mud for several
months, during which time the combined action of alkali
and Bacillus fermentation generates dark colors and interesting flavors.

Some of our most nutritionally significant and culturally important foods, including most bread and alcoholic
beverages, require ethanolic fermentation by yeast fungi.

Milk curd forms by lactic acid fermentation and rennet proteolysis, rendering casein insoluble. The cleaved
peptides coagulate to form a semisolid curd. The main
fermentative organisms are lactic acid bacteria.
Cheese varieties include unripened cheeses, semihard
and hard cheeses that are cooked down and ripened,
brined cheeses, and mold-ripened cheeses.
Cheese flavors are generated by minor side products
of fermentation, such as alcohols, esters, and sulfur
compounds.
Soy fermentation to tempeh and other products
improves digestibility and decreases undesirable soy
components such as phytates and lectins. The fermentative agent of tempeh is the bread mold Rhizopus
oligosporus.

The most prominent yeast used is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, known as baker’s yeast or brewer’s yeast (Fig. 16.17).
A hardy organism, S. cerevisiae easily survives on a grocery
shelf for home use and is genetically tractable for fundamental research. The yeast has been studied since the time
of Pasteur, who used it to prove the biological basis of fermentation (presented in Chapter 1). S. cerevisiae today is a
major model system of cell biology, yielding the molecular
secrets of human cancer and other diseases.
Bread making depends on carbon dioxide to generate air
spaces that leaven the dough, making its substance easier
to chew and digest. The small amount of ethanol produced
is eliminated during baking. For alcoholic beverages, however, ethanol is the key product, accompanied by carbon
dioxide bubbles for “fizz,” known as carbonation.

Modern bread sold commercially is produced on an
industrial scale. The dough is made in huge vats and then
cut into regular chunks that are placed into the bread pans.
The loaves are baked under hot-air convection, a method
that greatly decreases the baking time. In the United
States, most commercial bread is sliced mechanically—an
invention that dates back to 1912. Sliced bread, however,
has a shorter shelf life unless preservative chemicals prevent

from wine or beer production as a starter culture.
Yeast bread production. The preparation of all forms of
yeast bread requires the same fundamental steps. A starter
culture of yeast is included in the dough. The yeast can be
commercial baker’s yeast, or it can be sourdough starter,
an undefi ned microbial population derived from a previous
batch of dough. Analysis of sourdough shows mainly yeasts
and lactobacilli, which release acids that favor the growth
of the yeasts. The dough is kneaded to develop a fi ne network of air pockets and allowed to rise, expanding with
production of the carbon dioxide gas (Fig. 16.19). The
fi nest-textured breads are made from wheat flour, which
contains gluten, a protein complex that forms a fi ne molecular network supporting the rising dough.

Injera is made from teff (Eragrostis tef ), a grain with
small, round kernels that have high protein and lack gluten. Teff grows in arid regions and is now being cultivated
in the United States for gluten-free products. Because teff
lacks gluten, it cannot rise as much as wheat flour, but
it makes a kind of flatbread. The dough is spread into a
wide pancake, and the organisms present in the grain and
air are allowed to ferment it for 3 days. The fermentation includes a succession of species, usually dominated
by the yeast Candida. The extended fermentation generates a complex range of by-products that confer exceptional flavors in the baked product. In Ethiopia, injera
forms the basis of an entire meal, served with other food
items placed upon it as an edible tablecloth. Diners wrap
samples of each food in a fold of injera and consume them
together.

Alcoholic Beverages: Beer and Wine

Ethanolic fermentation of grain or fruit was important to
early civilizations because it provided a drink free of waterborne pathogens. Traditional forms of beer also provided
essential vitamins in the unfiltered yeasts.
Ethanol is unique among fermentation products in that
it provides a significant source of caloric intake, but it is
also a toxin that impairs mental function. A modest level of
ethanol enters the human circulation naturally from intestinal flora, equivalent to a fraction of a drink per day. The
human liver produces the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase,
which detoxifies ethanol. This enzyme in a healthy liver
can metabolize small amounts of alcohol without harm.

and modern. A. Making beer in ancient Egypt,

duction is one of the most
ancient fermentation practices and is depicted in the
statuary of ancient Egyptian
tombs dated to 5,000 years
ago (Fig. 16.21A). The earliest Sumerian beers were
made from bread soaked in
water and fermented. Today,
most beer is produced commercially
by
fermenting
barley using giant vats (Fig. 16.21B). Production of
high-quality beer involves complex processing with many
steps, including germination of barley grains, mashing in
water and cooking, and introduction of hops for flavor
(eTopic 16.1).
First the barley grains must germinate; that is, the seed
embryos must start to grow. The germinating embryo
makes enzymes needed to break down the barley starch to
maltose (disaccharide) and glucose. Most of the sugars are
fermented by yeast to ethanol and carbon dioxide. However, minor side products contribute flavors—or unpleasant
off-flavors if present in too great an amount (Fig. 16.22).
For example, off-flavors may result from the presence of
small amounts of oxygen that oxidize some ethanol to
acetaldehyde.
The yeast ferment most sugars to ethanol, but a small
fraction is drawn off to make amino acids via TCA cycle
intermediates, as discussed in Chapter 15. The 2-oxo
acids of the TCA cycle are analogous to pyruvate, with
the methyl group replaced by extended carbon chains
(R group). A tiny amount of the 2-oxo acids is converted
to long-chain alcohols, which add desirable f lavor to
beer.

produce the best-known wines, but wines and distilled
liquors are also made from apples, plums, and other fruits.
The key difference between fermentation of fruits and fermentation of grains is the exceptionally high monosaccharide content in fruits. Grape juice, for example, can contain
concentrations of glucose and fructose as high as 15%. The
availability of simple sugars allows yeast to begin fermenting immediately, with no need for preliminary breakdown
of long-chain carbohydrates, as in the malting and mashing of beer.
Most modern wine production uses strains of the
grape Vitis vinifera. The grapes are crushed to release
juices, usually in the presence of antioxidants such as
sulfur dioxide (Fig. 16.23). For white wine, the skins
are removed before juice is fermented. For red wine, the
skins are included in early fermentation to extract the
red and purple anthocyanin pigments, as well as phenolic
f lavor compounds. The first few days of fermentation are
dominated by indigenous species of yeast naturally present on the grapes, such as Kloeckera and Hanseniaspora
species. Commercial producers usually inoculate with
standard Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whose population

The wine is seeded with Oenococcus oeni bacteria, which
ferment L-malate (deprotonated L-malic acid).
As in beer production, yeast fermentation of wine produces numerous minor products contributing flavor, such
as long-chain alcohols and esters. At the same time, overgrowth of yeast or the growth of undesired species can
produce excess amounts of these compounds, such as sulfides and phenolics, giving rise to off-flavors. Some undesired species require oxygen exposure, whereas others can
grow during storage and bottling. The balance of microbial populations is challenging to control and has a major
role in determining the quality of a given wine vintage.

Food Spoilage and
Preservation

We humans have always competed with microbes for our
food. When early humans killed an animal, microbes commenced immediately to consume its flesh. Because meat
perished so fast, it made economic sense to share the kill
immediately and consume it all as soon as possible. Vegetables might last longer, but eventually they succumbed to
mold and rot. Later societies developed preservation methods, such as drying, smoking, and canning, that enabled
humans to survive winters and dry seasons on stored food.
Modern food preservation depends on antimicrobial
agents (chemical substances that either kill microbes or
slow their growth), as well as physical preservative measures, such as treatment with heat and pressure. These
general principles of microbial control are described in
Chapter 5. Here we focus on microbial contamination and
food preservation from the perspective of the food industry.

Food Spoilage and Food Contamination

After food is harvested, several kinds of chemical changes
occur. Some begin instantly, whereas others take several
days to develop. Some changes, such as meat tenderizing,
may be considered desirable; others, such as putrefaction,
render food unfit for consumption. The major classes of
food change include:
■

Enzymatic processes. Following the death of an animal, its flesh undergoes proteolysis by its own enzymes.
Limited proteolysis tenderizes meat. Plants after harvest
undergo other changes; for example, in harvested corn
the sugar rapidly converts to starch. That is why vegetables taste sweetest immediately after harvest.

■

Chemical reactions with the environment. The most
common abiotic chemical reactions involve oxidation
by air—for example, lipid autooxidation, which generates rancid odors. Much research addresses oxidation, and the development of technologies to prevent it
(Fig. 16.24). For example, produce may be packaged
under an anaerobic atmosphere, in a film that prevents
oxygen transmission.

■

Microbiological processes. Microbes from the surface
of the food begin to consume it—some immediately,

For red wine, the grapes are fermented with the skins at a temperature that increases extraction of color and tannins. Right: For white
wine, the skins are removed before addition of yeast starter, and
the temperature is kept low to retain volatile flavors. Both kinds of
wine usually undergo malolactic fermentation by Oenococcus oeni,
special lactic acid bacteria that consume malic acid.

others later in succession—generating a wide range of
chemical products. In meat, internal organs of the digestive tract are an important source of microbial decay.
Microbial activity can aid food production, but it can
also have various undesirable effects. Two different classes
of microbial effects are distinguished: food spoilage and
food contamination with pathogens.
Food spoilage refers to microbial changes that render
a product obviously unfit or unpalatable for consumption.
For example, rancid milk or putrefied meats are unpalatable and contain metabolic products that may be deleterious to human health, such as oxidized fatty acids or
organic amines. Even in these cases, however, the definition of spoilage depends partly on cultural practice. What
is sour milk to one person may be buttermilk to another;
what one society considers spoiled meat, another may consider merely aged.
Different pathways of microbial metabolism lead to different kinds of spoilage. Sour flavors result from acid fermentation products, as in sour milk. Alkaline products generate
bitter flavor. Oxidation, particularly of fats, causes rancidity, whereas general decomposition of proteins and amino
acids leads to putrefaction. The particularly noxious odors
of putrefaction derive from amino acid breakdown products
that often have apt names, such as the amines cadaverine
and putrescine and the aromatic product skatole.

■

FOOD AND INDUSTRIAL MICROBIOLOGY

“Food contamination,” or food poisoning, refers to
the presence of microbial pathogens that cause human disease—for example, rotaviruses that cause gastrointestinal
illness. Other pathogens, such as Clostridium botulinum,
produce toxins with deadly effects (discussed in Chapter 25). Pathogens usually go unnoticed as food is consumed, because their numbers are very low, and they may
not even grow in the food. Even the freshest-appearing
food may cause serious illness if it has been contaminated
with a small number of pathogens.
Since our intestines are full of beneficial bacteria, what
makes a pathogen? Enteric pathogens are often closely
related to members of our gut microbiome, which normally outcompete invaders (discussed in Chapters 21
and 23). Nevertheless, a pathogen may overcome our
defenses, either by use of its virulence factors (see Chapter 25) or by taking advantage of host weakness due to
immunosuppression or to antibiotics depleting the normal microbiome.

How Food Spoils

Different foods spoil in different ways, depending on their
nutrient content, the microbial species, and environmental
factors such as temperature. Table 16.2 summarizes common forms of spoilage.
Dairy products. Milk and other dairy products contain

carbon sources, such as lactose, protein, and fat. In fresh
milk, the nutrient most available for microbial catabolism is
lactose, which commonly supports anaerobic fermentation
to sour milk. Fermentation by the right mix of microbes,
however, leads to yogurt and cheese production, as previously described.
Under certain conditions, bitter off-flavors may be produced by bacterial degradation of proteins. The release of
amines causes a rise in pH. Protein degradation is most
commonly caused by psychrophiles, species that grow well
at cold temperatures, such as those of refrigeration.
Cheeses are less susceptible than milk to general spoilage, because of their solid structure and lowered water
activity. However, cheeses can grow mold on their surface.
Historically, the surface growth of Penicillium strains led
to the invention of new kinds of cheeses. But other kinds
of mold, such as Aspergillus, produce toxins and undesirable flavors.
Meat and poultry. Meat in the slaughterhouse is easily con-

taminated with bacteria from hide, hooves, and intestinal
contents. Muscle tissue offers high water content, which
supports microbial growth, as well as rich nutrients, including glycogen, peptides, and amino acids. The breakdown
of peptides and amino acids produces the undesirable

odorants that defi ne spoilage (for example, cadaverine and
putrescine).
Meat also contains fat, or adipose tissue, but the lipids are largely unavailable to microbial action because they
consist of insoluble fat (triacylglycerides). Instead, meat
lipids commonly spoil abiotically by autooxidation (reaction with oxygen) of unsaturated fatty acids, independent
of microbial activity. Thus, when meats are exposed to air
during storage, they turn rancid—particularly meats such
as pork, which contains highly unsaturated lipids. Autooxidation can be prevented by anaerobic storage, such as
vacuum packing, which also prevents growth of aerobic
microorganisms. The absence of the suppressed organisms,

however, favors growth of lactic acid bacteria and facultative
anaerobes such as Brochothrix thermosphacta. These organisms generate short-chain fatty acids, which taste sour.
In industrialized societies, the most significant factor
determining microbial populations in meat spoilage is the
practice of refrigeration. Refrigeration prolongs the shelf
life of meat because contaminating microbes are predominantly mesophilic (grow at moderate temperatures, as discussed in Chapter 5). But ultimately, the few psychrotrophs
initially present do grow; typically, these are Pseudomonas
species. The pseudomonads are also favored by the low pH
of meat (pH 5.5–7.0), which results from the accumulation
of lactic acid in the muscle.

CHAPTER 16
Seafood. Fish and other seafood contain substantial

amounts of protein and lipids, as well as amines such as
trimethylamine oxide. Fish spoils more rapidly than meat
and poultry for several reasons. First, fish do not thermoregulate, and they inhabit relatively low-temperature
environments. Because fi sh grow in low-temperature environments, their surface microorganisms tend to be psychrotrophic and thus grow well under refrigeration. In
addition, marine fi sh contain high levels of the osmoprotectant trimethylamine oxide, which bacteria reduce
to trimethylamine, a volatile amine that gives seafood its
“fi shy” smell. Finally, the rapid microbial breakdown of
proteins and amino acids leads to foul-smelling amines and
sulfur compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide and dimethyl
sulfide.

Thought Question

16.8 Why would bacteria convert trimethylamine oxide

(TMAO) to trimethylamine? Would this kind of spoilage be
prevented by exclusion of oxygen?

Plant foods. Fruits, vegetables, and grains spoil differently

from animal foods because of their high carbohydrate content and their relatively low water content. The low water
content of plant foods usually translates into considerably
longer shelf life than for animal-based foods. Carbohydrates favor microbial fermentation to acids or alcohols that
limit further decomposition, and this microbial action can
be managed to produce fermented foods, as described in
Section 16.2.
Plant pathogens rarely infect humans but may destroy
the plant before harvest. Most plant pathogens are fungi,
although some are bacteria, such as Erwinia species. Historically, plant pathogens have caused major agricultural
catastrophes, such as the Irish potato famine, caused by
a fungus-like pathogen. Plant pathogens continue to devastate local economies and cause shortages worldwide; for
example, the witches’-broom fungus Crinipellis perniciosa
causes a fungal disease of cocoa trees that has drastically
cut Latin American cocoa production.
After harvest, various molds and bacteria can soften
and wilt plant foods by producing enzymes that degrade
the pectins and celluloses that give plants their structure.
In general, the more processed the food, the greater the
opportunities for spoilage. For example, citrus fruits generally last for several weeks, but peeled oranges are susceptible to spoilage by Gram-negative bacteria.
Baked bread usually resists spoilage, except for surface
molds. In rare cases, however, improperly baked bread can
show contamination. The appearance of red bread, caused

by the red bacterium Serratia marcescens, is believed to
have been the source of the “blood” observed in communion bread during a Catholic mass in the Italian town of
Bolsena in 1263—an event that became known as the Miracle of Bolsena.

Pathogens Contaminate Food

Intestinal pathogens spread readily because microbes can
be transmitted through food without any outward sign
that the food is spoiled. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there are 76 million cases of gastrointestinal illness a year in this country,
usually spread through water or food. Thus, one in four
Americans experiences gastrointestinal illness in a given
year. In 2013, under President Obama, the Food and Drug
Administration implemented new controls and rules as part
of the 2011 Food Safety Modernization Act, the largest
reform of the U.S. food safety laws in 70 years. The new
laws require, for example, that crop irrigation water be free
of pathogens and that agricultural workers have access to
bathroom facilities.
An example of food contamination is the 2008 outbreak of Salmonella enterica from peanut products. Peanuts contaminated at one processing plant led to an
epidemic that sickened 700 people across the United
States (Fig. 16.25A). The first cases of Salmonella infection were reported to the CDC on September 1, 2008.
Most infected individuals developed diarrhea, fever, and
abdominal cramps 12–72 hours after infection, and symptoms lasted 4–7 days. Over the next 6 months, cases were
reported from nearly all U.S. states. The curve of the outbreak (cases rising and then falling) followed the profile of
a single-source epidemic, in which all infections are ultimately traced back to one source. (Epidemics are discussed
in Chapter 28.)
What was the original source of the widespread outbreak? The CDC researchers compared the food intake
histories of ill persons against matched controls. They
found a statistical association between illness and intake of
peanut butter, eventually narrowed to a specific brand of
peanut butter sold to institutions. As the epidemic grew,
cases emerged in which the contaminated food product
was crackers filled with peanut butter cream. Ultimately,
the peanut butter and cream were traced back to peanuts
from a single factory in Georgia. At the food plant, the
source of Salmonella contamination could not be identified, but the plant records showed that product samples

the product, the plant had retested the samples until they
“tested negative.” Numerous health violations were cited,
including gaps in the walls and dirt buildup throughout

Salmonella bacteria are very common pathogens. Did
all of the cases of illness result from a common strain? The
CDC used DNA analysis to show that all patients carried a common strain of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium.
(A serovar is a strain whose surface proteins elicit a distinctive immune response.) The strain was identified by
analysis of its genomic DNA cleaved by restriction endonucleases (see Section 7.6). Each restriction endonuclease
cleaves DNA at sequence-specific positions. Strains that
differ at key restriction sites generate cleavage fragments
of differing length, which are separated by pulsed-field
electrophoresis (Fig. 16.25B). In electrophoresis, applied
voltage causes DNA fragments to migrate different distances according to size; the pulsed field optimizes separation of the largest sizes. The distance each fragment
moves is visualized as a band in the gel. The band pattern, or “fingerprint,” of Salmonella DNA from infected
patients showed the same fragment lengths as Salmonella
DNA from the peanut butter sample, labeled “(1)” in Figure 16.25B. The band pattern from this peanut butter
sample (1) was different from that of another infected peanut butter sample (2); the bacterium in (2) proved unrelated to the Salmonella outbreak.

This case illustrates several troubling features of food
contamination in modern society. It shows the consequence of a food production plant’s failure to follow regulations, and the failure of health inspection to enforce
them. The contaminated product shipped out to a diverse
array of institutions such as schools and to secondary producers such as cookie manufacturers, who incorporated
the peanut butter cream ingredient. The bacteria then
remained viable in contaminated food products for many
months, sickening people long after the contamination
event occurred.

Food-Borne Pathogens Emerge
from Environment and Agriculture

Our environment and agriculture present constant sources
of potential pathogens. Agricultural microbiologists continually assess the potential contamination of produce. For
example, student Julia DeNiro worked with Douglas Doohan at the Ohio State University to study contamination
of lettuce and tomatoes fertilized by manure (Fig. 16.26).

vesicle fusion in the terminals of peripheral motor neurons
(Fig. 16.30). Synaptic inhibition prevents activation of
muscle cells, causing flaccid paralysis. Microbial toxins are
discussed further in Chapter 25.

Food Preservation

Cultural practices and cuisines have long evolved to limit
food spoilage. Such practices include cooking (heat treatment), addition of spices (chemical preservation), and
fermentation (partial microbial digestion). In modern commercial food production, spoilage and contamination are
prevented by numerous methods based on fundamental
principles of physics and biochemistry that limit microbial
growth (discussed in Chapter 5).

pathogenicity island. A pathogenicity island consists of
a set of genes and operons that function coordinately (as
discussed in Section 9.6). The colocalization of the genes
enables transfer of virulence capability to other species as
pathogens evolve. Figure 16.29 shows an example of a
pathogenicity island in Salmonella. Four of its operons contribute to the type III secretion complex, which secretes
toxins and host colonization factors (discussed in Chapter 25). Other genes encode outer membrane proteins that
counteract host defenses, as well as regulators of virulence
gene expression.
The most dangerous consequence of infection by foodborne pathogens is the production of a potentially fatal
toxin. For example, E. coli O157:H7 infection of the intestines can be overcome, but the bacteria produce Shiga
toxin, which can destroy the kidneys. In cases of adult botulism, Clostridium botulinum does not usually grow within
the patient; the botulinum toxin comes from bacteria that

Physical means of preservation. Specific processes that

preserve food based on temperature, pressure, or other
physical factors include:
■

Dehydration and freeze-drying. Removal of water
prevents microbial growth. Water is removed either
by application of heat or by freezing under vacuum
(known as freeze-drying, or lyophilization). Drying
is especially effective for vegetables and pasta. The disadvantage of drying is that some nutrients are broken
down.

■

Refrigeration and freezing. Refrigeration temperature (typically –2°C to 16°C) slows microbial growth,
as shown in an experiment comparing bacterial growth
in ground beef at different temperatures (Fig. 16.31).
Nevertheless, refrigeration also selects for psychrotrophs, such as Listeria. Freezing halts the growth of
most microbes, but preexisting contaminant strains
often survive to grow again when the food is thawed.
This is why deep-frozen turkeys, for example, can still
cause Salmonella poisoning, especially if the interior is
not fully thawed before roasting.

Controlled or modified atmosphere. Food can be

with decreased oxygen or increased CO2. Controlled
atmospheres limit abiotic oxidation, as well as microbial
growth. For example, CO2 storage is particularly effective for extending the shelf life of apples.

effective for extending the shelf life of liquid foods with
consistent, well-understood microbial flora, such as milk
and fruit juices.
■

Canning. In canning, the most widespread and effective means of long-term food storage, food is cooked
under pressure to attain a temperature high enough
to destroy endospores (typically 121°C). Commercial
canning effectively eliminates microbial contaminants,
except in very rare cases. The main drawback of canning
is that it incurs some loss of food value, particularly that
of labile biochemicals such as vitamins, as well as loss of
desirable food texture and taste.

■

Ionizing radiation. Exposure to ionizing radiation,
known as food irradiation, effectively sterilizes many
kinds of food for long-term storage. The main concerns
about food irradiation are its potential for unknown
effects on food chemistry and the hazards of the irradiation process itself for personnel involved in food processing. Nevertheless, irradiation has proved highly effective
at eliminating pathogens that would otherwise cause
serious illness.

Pasteurization. Invented by Louis Pasteur, pasteurization is a short-term heat treatment designed to decrease
microbial contamination with minimal effect on food
value and texture (discussed in Chapter 5). For example,
milk is commonly pasteurized at 63°C for 30 minutes,
followed by quick cooling to 4°C. Pasteurization is most

Often, two or more means of preservation are used in
combination, such as acid treatment and refrigeration. For
example, Figure 16.32 shows results of a typical experiment measuring the effect of pH on microbial survival in
refrigerated food—in this case, E. coli O157:H7 in Greek
eggplant salad. Note the critical threshold pH required
to decrease bacterial counts. At pH 4.0, about the pH of
lemon juice, the bacteria show a steep exponential death
curve, whereas at pH 4.5 the bacteria remain viable for
many days.

Therefore, the value of 12D (required to decrease a population by 12 logs) is 12D111 = 1,800 minutes. Sterilization
may take longer, but food quality is likely to remain high,
because the sterilizing temperature is lower.

■

Acids. While microbial fermentation can preserve foods
by acidification, an alternative approach is to add acids
directly. Organic acids commonly used to preserve food
include benzoic acid, sorbic acid, and propionic acid.
The acids are generally added as salts: sodium benzoate,
potassium sorbate, sodium propionate. These acids act
by crossing the cell membrane in the protonated form
and then releasing their protons at the higher intracellular pH. For this reason, they work best in foods that
already have moderate acidity (pH 5–6), such as dried
fruits and processed cheeses.

■

Esters. The esters of organic acids often show antimicrobial activity whose basis is poorly understood. Examples include fatty acid esters and parabens (benzoic acid
esters). They are used to preserve processed cheeses and
vegetables.

■

Other organic compounds. Numerous organic compounds, both traditional and synthetic, have antimicrobial properties. For example, cinnamon and cloves
contain the benzene derivative eugenol, a potent antimicrobial agent.

■

Inorganic compounds. Inorganic food preservatives
include salts, such as phosphates, nitrites, and sulfites.
Nitrites and sulfites inhibit aerobic respiration of bacteria, and their effectiveness is enhanced at low pH.
These substances, however, may have harmful effects on
humans; nitrites can be converted to toxic nitrosamines,
and sulfites cause allergic reactions in some people.

How does the food industry know how long to treat
food for sterilization? Several measurements indicate the
efficiency of heat killing. The D-value (decimal reduction
time) was described in Chapter 5. An additional measure is
12D, the amount of time required to kill 1012 spores (or to
decrease a population by 12 log10 units). A third measure is
the z-value, the increase in degrees Celsius needed to lower
the D-value to 1/10 of the time. If, for example, D100 (the
D-value at 100°C) and D110 (the D-value at 110°C) for a
given organism are 20 minutes and 2 minutes, respectively,
then 12D100 equals 240 minutes (that is, 20 minutes × 12),
and the z-value is 10°C (because a 10°C increase in temperature reduced the D-value to 1/10, from 20 minutes
to 2 minutes). These measurements are determined empirically for each organism. The values are extremely important
to the canning industry, which must ensure that canned
goods do not contain spores of Clostridium botulinum,
the anaerobic soil microbe that causes the paralyzing foodborne disease botulism (see Fig. 16.30).
Because the tastes of certain foods suffer if they are overheated, z-values and 12D-values are used to adjust heating times and temperatures to achieve the same sterilizing
result. Take the following example, where D121 is 10 minutes and 12D121 is 120 minutes. Sterilizing at 121°C for
120 minutes might result in food with a repulsive taste,
whereas decreasing the temperature and extending the
heating time might yield a more palatable product. The
D-values and z-values are used to adjust conditions for
sterilization at a lower temperature. If D121 is 15 minutes
(the time needed to kill 90% of cells) and the z-value is
known to be 10°C (the temperature change needed to
change D-value tenfold), then decreasing temperature by
10°C, to 111°C, will mean D111 is 150 minutes (10 × D121).

Thought Question

methods to completely eliminate microbes from food?

Food spoilage refers to chemical changes that render
food unfit for consumption. Food spoils through degradation by enzymes within the food, through spontaneous
chemical reactions, and through microbial metabolism.

activities that spread pathogens.

from cloned genes; or proteins from microbes with useful properties, such as thermostability or increased catalytic activity for a chemical process.
■

Isolating a microbe to produce the product. A novel
product, such as an antibiotic, is generally developed
from a naturally occurring microbe. The genes encoding
product biosynthesis may then be cloned into an industrial vector.

■

Scaling up production in quantity. The producer
microbial strain must be grown on an industrial scale,
and the product must be isolated and purified.

■

Developing a business plan. The scientist-entrepreneur
must obtain partners skilled at industrial management,
finance, and marketing. Patents must be filed to protect
intellectual property rights.

■

Safety and efficacy testing. Human consumption,
environmental introduction, or consumer use requires
many levels of testing prior to commercialization, including, in some cases, approval by government agencies.

■

Effective marketing. The benefits of the new product must be communicated effectively to convince
customers of its superiority to current products or
processes.

Dairy products can be soured by excessive fermentation
or made bitter by bacterial proteolysis.
Meat and poultry are putrefied by decarboxylating
bacteria, which produce amines with noxious odors.
Fish and other seafood spoil rapidly because their
unsaturated fatty acids rapidly oxidize; they harbor psychrotrophic bacteria that grow under refrigeration; and
their trimethylamine oxide is reduced by bacteria to the
fishy-smelling trimethylamine.
Vegetables spoil by excess growth of bacteria and molds.
Plant pathogens destroy food crops before harvest.
Food preservation includes physical treatments, such as
freezing and canning, as well as the addition of chemical
preservatives, such as benzoates and nitrites.

16.6

Industrial Microbiology

The production and preservation of food is only one field
of industrial microbiology, the commercial exploitation
of microbes. Industrial microbiology is commonly understood to include a broad range of commercial products
derived from microbes, including vaccines and clinical
devices; industrial solvents and catalytic enzymes; bioinformatic analysis of genomes; and genetically modified plants
and animals using microbial vectors.
Other important fields of industrial microbiology are
wastewater treatment, bioremediation, and environmental
management, covered in Chapters 21 and 22.

Failure at any of the preceding tasks spells doom for
the product. Thus, a prudent business plan includes having multiple alternative products in development. Although
the failure rate of new products is high, all the products we
use had to overcome these risks. How does a bench scientist convert a microbial concept into a profitable product?
Some scientists acquire partners to found their own company. Others join a mature company that offers many kinds
of expertise in business and production.

Industrial Microbiology Aims
for Commercial Success

Carol Nacy (Fig. 16.33A) studied tropical infectious diseases for 17 years at the Walter Reed Army Institute of
Research. She saw the need to fight tuberculosis, a disease that is the world’s number one killer of women aged
15–44 and the leading killer of men, after traffic accidents.
The United States spends $1 billion yearly to treat 13,000
incident cases; yet the standard antibiotics for tuberculosis
were developed before 1970, and the main diagnostic test
available (the tuberculin skin test) dates to 1880, the time
of Robert Koch. The best available vaccine—the Bacille
Calmette-Guérin (BCG) live, attenuated vaccine—is only
50% effective.
Nacy obtained business experience by working for several years as a chief scientific officer for the pharmaceutical

The practical application of a microbial product or device
may arise out of an industrial laboratory, or it may be conceived by a research scientist with the aim of meeting a
compelling need in society. In all cases, however, the key
goal is to succeed in the marketplace—that is, to generate
a product that customers adopt over alternative technologies. The product’s sales must cover the costs of raw materials and production and (in a for-profit company) generate a
profit for the shareholders. Success requires:

company EntreMed, Inc. She then founded her own company, Sequella, to develop innovative drugs and treatment
devices. Sequella targets innovative ideas with high risk but
also high potential to improve performance, rapidity, and
safety of diagnosing and treating TB infections. Nacy and
her cofounders scanned the academic community for novel
ideas that had succeeded against TB in “proof of principle”
animal models. The most promising ideas were developed
for improved antibiotics, rapid and less invasive tests for TB
exposure, and devices to measure the extent of pulmonary
infection. Because any one idea had a high risk of failure,
researchers pursued multiple prospects in each category.
The company also took on multiple target diseases, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and
vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE).
Sequella’s most promising antibiotic, SQ109, was discovered by high-throughput screening of a chemical
library, in collaboration with Clifton Barry at the National
Institutes of Health. The chemical library consisted of
over 60,000 analogs of a known TB antibiotic, ethambutol (Fig. 16.33B). Ethambutol is part of the current standard treatment for TB, whose 6-month time course has a
poor compliance rate. It is hoped that improved drugs will
shorten the time course and improve compliance, thereby
decreasing the appearance of drug-resistant strains. The
analog molecules were selected for their common diamine
core, with different combinations of side chains. The
60,000 compounds in the library were subjected to combinatorial screening, a mathematically intensive analysis
based on numerous tests. Of the compounds tested, 2,796
showed activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the
test tube. The 69 best compounds were tested for cytotoxicity in tissue culture, activity in TB-infected macrophages,
and activity in infected animals. The compound with the

Microbial Products

Companies such as Sequella seek agents to combat microbial pathogens, but increasingly, industry seeks beneficial
microbes from natural sources to produce useful products. The microbe is cultured to synthesize a commercially
valuable chemical substance such as the industrial enzyme
lipase B (see the Current Research Highlight), or a material for manufacturing. An example of a microbial material
used for manufacture is alginate (Fig. 16.34A). Alginate
is a carboxylated polysaccharide, which has long been harvested commercially from giant kelp, Macrocystis pyrifera
(Fig. 16.34B). The kelps harvested for alginate are “brown
algae,” eukaryotic microbes (discussed in Chapter 20). The
product alginate has many commercial uses, as a thickener
for food products from ice cream to faux caviar, a textile
printing agent, and a modeling material for dental materials and life casting (Fig. 16.34C). Alginate is just one of
a mushrooming number of products in what we call the
fermentation industry.
Examples of commercial microbial products are listed
in Table 16.4. Each product requires a gene or operon of
genes encoding either the product itself or the enzymes for
the product’s biosynthesis. For example, the Danish company Novozymes markets over 700 microbial enzymes for
products ranging from laundry detergents to agricultural
inoculants (discussed in Special Topic 16.1). Novozymes
also produces numerous enzymes as biocatalysts for green
chemistry. “Green chemistry” refers to environmentally
friendly procedures for reactions in organic chemistry, typically using water solution in place of petroleum-derived
organic solvents.
We may distinguish between two fundamentally different sources of products: cloned genes from human,
animal, or plant sources; and native microbial products

from newly discovered species in the environment, often
from extreme conditions. Cloned human genes typically encode a protein of valuable function in the human
body. For example, Therabron Therapeutics produces
the recombinant human protein CC10, a lung development protein that is often deficient in the lungs of premature infants. The recombinant protein, produced and
purified from a recombinant bacterium, can be used to
reduce lung inflammation in premature infants, as well
as patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD). Cloning gene products in recombinant organisms was discussed in Chapter 12.
To identify new microbial products, companies screen
thousands of microbial strains from diverse ecosystems. The
search for organisms with potential commercial applications is called bioprospecting. Bioprospecting can be done
anywhere, from one’s backyard to Yellowstone National
Park. Unique ecosystems are the most promising sources of
previously unknown microbial strains with valuable properties. Extreme environments such as the hot springs of
Yellowstone are particularly promising because their products may tolerate higher temperatures that are required for
industrial use. Psychrophiles from extremely cold environments such as Antarctica are a useful source for enzymes
that are active in a wide range of temperatures, such as the
lipase from Candida antarctica (see the Current Research
Highlight). Unfortunately, many such unique ecosystems
are endangered by pollution, human-introduced invasive
species, and global climate change.
An important aspect of bioprospecting is “mining the
genome.” Once a promising source strain is obtained, its

genome is sequenced to investigate the genetic sequences
that encode the useful product and regulate its expression. The operons encoding the product (or enzymes for
its production) can then be cloned for optimal production
(see Chapter 12). The cloned genes are transferred into an
industrial strain, a strain whose growth characteristics are
well studied and optimized for industrial production. An
industrial strain must possess the following attributes:
■

Genetic stability and manipulation. The industrial
strain must reproduce reliably, without major DNA rearrangements. It must also have an efficient gene transfer
system by which vectors can introduce genes of interest
into its genome.

■

Inexpensive growth requirements. Industrial strains
must grow on low-cost carbon sources with minimal
special needs, such as vitamins, and at easily maintained
conditions of temperature and gases.

■

Safety. Industrial strains must be nonpathogenic and
must not produce toxic by-products.

■

High level of product expression. The strain or recombinant vector must possess an efficient gene expression
system to generate the desired product as a high proportion of its cell mass.

■

Ready harvesting of product. Either the product must
be secreted by the cell or, if the product is intracellular,
the cells must be easily breakable to liberate the product.

Common species for industrial strains include the bacterium Bacillus subtilis, the yeast Candida utilis, and the

oxygenation throughout the vessel and minimizing foaming of the culture liquid. A small change in any of the
growth factors can impact production costs and profit margin. Another major concern is to avoid contamination by
other organisms.
The fermentor is the core of the first half of industrial
production, known as upstream processing (Fig. 16.36,
top). Upstream processing refers to the culturing of the
industrial microbe to produce large quantities of product
or cell mass. All aspects of the process must be controlled
to maximize the final concentration of product, which
in most cases peaks at a specific time in the microbial
growth cycle. Following microbial growth, the culture
must be harvested and the product purified. These processes constitute downstream processing (Fig. 16.36,
bottom). The first step of downstream processing is to
separate the microbial cells from the culture fluid, by
centrifugation or by filtration. Next, the primary recovery of product follows one of two different pathways,
depending on whether the product is maintained within
the cells or secreted into the culture fluid. Many kinds of
subsequent purification and finishing steps are necessary
before the product has acceptable quality for its desired
use. Again, failure of any detail can render the entire
product unusable.

Products designed for human consumption or use in
the environment face formidable hurdles in clinical testing, toxicological studies, and, finally, approval by the
appropriate regulatory agency, such as the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA). After millions of dollars are invested in process development, the product may
still fail one of these late-stage hurdles and never come to
market. Not surprisingly, a company must research thousands of potential products before achieving one that
makes a profit. The consumer cost inevitably includes the
development costs not only of the one successful product,
such as recombinant insulin, but also of all the products
that failed.
Despite all the hurdles to overcome, companies such
as Novozymes sell hundreds of products and make billion-dollar profits. Examples of commercially successful
products are described in Special Topic 16.1.

Production in Plant or
Animal Host Systems

Some products require subtle processing that occurs correctly only within eukaryotic cells. For example, protein
products may require posttranslational modifications such
as glycosylation (attachment of polysaccharide chains).

METABOLISM AND BIOCHEMISTRY

SPECIAL TOPIC 16.1,, Microbial Enzymes Make Money
How can we clean our clothes with less pollution and keep
their colors bright? Can we remove carcinogens from our food
and increase crop yields with less environmental impact? The
answers to these questions lie in the microbial genomes. Microbial genes encode enzymes with properties worth hundreds of
billions of dollars. But it takes a sophisticated research company to discover enzymes, develop them, and make a profit.
One of the foremost microbial companies today is Novozymes. Founded in 1925, the company produced insulin and
trypsin by extraction from animal tissues—a laborious, expensive process. In 1963, Novozymes introduced its first product of
microbial fermentation: the detergent enzyme Alcalase. In the
1980s the company took up genetic modification (recombiWashed 25 times

nant DNA) to develop dozens of profitable microbial enzymes
for cleaning, including Lipolase, a lipase (fat cleavage) from
the fungus Thermomyces lanuginosus; and Protamex, a protease (protein cleavage) from Bacillus bacteria. These enzymes
break down and solubilize various components of food stains.
Active at room temperature, these enzymes precisely remove
the most common food stains while avoiding the energyexpensive heating of water. They also avoid the need for phosphate detergents, which pollute waterways.
Some cleaning enzymes actually improve the appearance
of clothing. The cellulase Carezyme, for example, hydrolyzes
short, frayed ends of cellulose that project from a cotton
garment after many cleanings (Fig. 1). Cotton consists of

In such cases, the expressed genes must be transferred from
a bacterial or viral vector into an animal, fungal, or plant
tissue culture or to a transgenic organism. The microbially transformed organism may itself be the industrial product. Here we present an example of microbial production
involving the plant engineering bacterium Agrobacterium
tumefaciens. A second example, that of an insect caterpillar
virus, is presented in eTopic 16.2.
Bacteria and viruses provide the vectors for transferring genes into multicellular organisms, as discussed in

Asparaginase prevents formation of acrylamide.

Asparaginase converts asparagine into aspartic acid. Without the
action of asparaginase, asparagine combines with sugar at high
temperature (the Maillard reaction) and then releases acrylamide.

Chapter 12. A bacterium of major industrial importance
is A. tumefaciens, a tumor-inducing plant pathogen that
conducts natural genetic engineering on dicot plants
(Fig. 16.37 ). Agrobacterium strains have now been
adapted by scientists to engineer even monocots. Long
before scientists invented “recombinant DNA,” A. tumefaciens had evolved a gene transfer system by which it
induces infected plant cells to generate food molecules
to feed the pathogen. This highly efficient gene transfer system is readily modified to insert genes conferring

crystalline fibers of cellulose (a glucose polysaccharide, discussed in Chapter 13). Cutting the frayed ends removes the
fuzzy appearance, restoring the solid color of the garment.
But why does this powerful enzyme not destroy the entire
garment? The enzyme has been engineered for high specificity: It cleaves only the highly disordered stray fibrils, not the
ordered cellulose of the intact fabric. The enzyme was originally isolated from a species of Bacillus that uses it to catabolize plant material.
Novozymes develops a number of enzymes with exciting
applications for food production. In 2002, food scientists
reported in Nature that high-temperature cooking of many
foods results in formation of acrylamide, a carcinogen. The
acrylamide forms in foods such as bread crusts and crackers,
French fries, and coffee. It was shown to arise from a reaction between sugar and amino acids, particularly the amino
acid asparagine (Fig. 2). First the asparagine condenses with
the sugar by a mechanism known as the Maillard reaction. The
molecule then rearranges, releasing acrylamide.
How can the acrylamide production be prevented? Novozymes scientists reasoned that most of the acrylamide production could be avoided by pretreatment of the food with

the enzyme asparaginase, which deaminates asparagine to
aspartic acid. They obtained the asparaginase gene from a
strain of the fungus Aspergillus. An industrial organism was
engineered to produce the enzyme in quantity, and marketed
as Acrylaway. Figure 3 outlines the use of Acrylaway to avoid
acrylamide production in French fries. The enzyme is added to
potato strips during the dipping step, before the potatoes are
dried and fried. Because the enzyme is completely “natural,”
it introduces no new toxin. Industrial trials completed in 2012
confirmed that Acrylaway effectively protects many kinds of
food from carcinogenic acrylamide.

traits of interest, such as herbicide resistance, into plant
genomes.
Tumorigenic strains of A. tumefaciens possess a special
plasmid for engineering plant cells, called the Ti plasmid
(tumor-inducing plasmid). The Ti plasmid is the source of
the genetic material that gets transferred into a plant cell
through a process mediated by bacterial proteins, similar
to conjugation (see Section 9.1). The Ti plasmid includes
the vir operons, which encode a virulence system, as well
as the T-DNA (transferable DNA), a set of genes that will

be transferred to the host plant and recombined into its
genome. T-DNA encodes tumor induction genes, such as
auxin synthesis genes, as well as enzymes for biosynthesis
of a carbon and nitrogen source called an opine. Opines
are specialized amino acids made by a one-step synthesis
from arginine, typically by amination of a central metabolite such as pyruvate or 2-oxoglutarate. A given strain of A.
tumefaciens typically provides one type of opine synthesis
enzyme and has the ability to metabolize the corresponding opine.

containing opine synthesis genes into a plant, which then produces opines to feed the bacteria. Right: A. tumefaciens can be engineered to

divided into two separate plasmids: one containing the vir operon conducting DNA transfer, the other containing T-DNA with most of its
genes substituted by a desired recombinant gene.

The Agrobacterium vector transfers its DNA to the
plant by means of the vir gene products. The vir gene
products from the Ti plasmid detect the presence of a
plant host and stimulate plasmid transfer (see Fig. 16.37,
left). In the cell envelope, VirA protein detects a chemical
signal from a wounded plant, which is capable of being
infected. VirA then activates VirG to induce expression
of other vir genes, encoding endonucleases VirD1 and
VirD2, and the VirB secretion complex. The VirD endonucleases cleave the left and right ends of the T-DNA and
direct its transfer into the plant cell through the VirB system. Within the plant cell nucleus, the T-DNA becomes
integrated into the plant genome, where it induces opine

production. The opine-producing cells proliferate, forming a tumor.
For industrial use (Fig. 16.37, right), a recombinant
strain of A. tumefaciens has the Ti plasmid divided into
two separate plasmids. One contains the vir operons conducting DNA transfer, while the other contains T-DNA
with its left and right ends intact but its genes substituted by the desired recombinant genes. Upon infection,
the virulence system induces transfer of the T-DNA to
the plant cell without any tumor-inducing genes, allowing genomic integration of the recombinant genes with
their desired traits, without tumor induction or opine
production.

Thought Question

16.11 Why would an herbicide resistance gene be desirable
in an agricultural plant? What long-term problems might be
caused by microbial transfer of herbicide resistance genes
into plant genomes?

Microbe as Product

Microbes as biological agents possess enormous potential
for environmental use. The most well known example is
the bacterial insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis (discussed in
Chapter 12). Such microbes, derived from natural sources,
may improve crop production and enhance agricultural sustainability. Most methods used by farmers to improve crop
yields require large amounts of fertilizer and pest management, including herbicides and fungicides. To alleviate the
financial and environmental impacts of large-scale farming,
scientists are working to develop microbial solutions that
can supplement chemical additives and pesticides, resulting
in higher yields to farmers.
Scientists at Novozymes partner with Monsanto to conduct large-scale bioprospecting. The scientists screen thousands of microbes for positive impacts on agriculture. Some
of the microbial products result in higher corn yields across
North America. One example is JumpStart, which consists
of the mold Penicillium bilaii (Fig. 16.38A). The mold

Bioprospecting is the mass screening of new microbial
strains for promising traits and potential use in a product. Thermophiles and psychrophiles are particularly
important sources of new strains with potentially interesting new properties.
Microbial products must be competitive with alternative technologies. Developing a competitive new molecular product requires identifying a useful molecule,
isolating and developing a fermentation technique to produce it,
scaling up for production in quantity, developing a business plan,
and testing for safety.

Another microbial product is Actinovate, a biological fungicide used for the suppression of root rot and damping-off
fungi, as well as the suppression or control of leaf fungal
pathogens. The active ingredient of Actinovate is the actinomycete Streptomyces lydicus (Fig. 16.38B). S. lydicus grows
as a mutualist associated with the roots of crop plants. The
bacteria feed off plant exudates while secreting antimicrobial
substances that suppress pathogens. These examples are the

Bacteria evolve before our eyes. Two Escherichia coli clones
compete, marked by genetic traits that make colonies appear red or white with an indicator dye. The proportion of
colonies with each color shows which clone outcompetes
the other. For example, if red colonies can metabolize citrate
in the growth medium, whereas white colonies do not, then
the red colonies will outnumber the white colonies, indicating
greater fitness. This competition assay measures the relative
fitness of bacteria from Richard Lenski’s Long-Term Evolution Experiment. In this experiment, E. coli evolved a surprising way to metabolize the medium’s citrate buffer. Caroline
Turner discovered that some clones evolved a cooperative
relationship in which one clone obtains nutrients produced by
a different clone that catabolizes citrate.

icrobial life appeared as early as 3.8 billion years ago, soon after our planet, Earth,
formed out of dust surrounding the young
Sun. Since then, microbes have evolved into forms
adapted to diverse ways of life, from psychrophiles
beneath the ice of Antarctica to anaerobes in the
human colon. All living plants and animals, including
ourselves, are descendants of those early microbes.

The persistence of the citrate-minus
bacteria is remarkable because the
citrate-plus bacteria had such a big
advantage. They had sole access to
a large pool of resources. To me, the
survival of the citrate-minus bacteria

a concept called spontaneous generation (discussed in
Chapter 1). Others argued against spontaneous generation
and devised experiments to show that even microbes have
“parents.” Today, genetic evidence overwhelmingly confirms that all life on Earth, including microbes, arises from
preexisting life. But these experiments do not address the
origin of the very first living cells—or how early life gave
rise to multicellular plants and animals.
As early as 1802, the naturalist Erasmus Darwin, grandfather of Charles Darwin, wrote:
Organic life beneath the shoreless waves
Was born and nurs’d in ocean’s pearly caves;
First forms minute, unseen by spheric glass,
Move on the mud, or pierce the watery mass;
These, as successive generations bloom,
New powers acquire and larger limbs assume.
Thus, nineteenth-century biologists developed the idea
that “minute” life-forms arose in the ocean—and that all
organisms evolved from microbes, perhaps even from cells
too small to be seen with the “spheric glass” of a microscope.
Even without the tools of genetics, thoughtful observers
recognized the commonalities among all living cells, such
as the membrane-enclosed compartment of cytoplasm and
common metabolic pathways like sugar metabolism. Today,
lines of evidence from geology, biochemistry, and genetics
overwhelmingly support the microbial origin of life.
What might the first life-forms have looked like?

Early Life

Microbiologists find clues to the nature of early life in a
place where today only the most rudimentary life-forms
exist: the Dry Valleys of Antarctica (Fig. 17.1). The valleys’ cold, dry winters (–40°C) preclude most multicellular

life. But in the austral summer (January), temperatures rise
above zero and glacier melt trickles into streams. Longdormant cyanobacteria come to life, painting the streams
orange (Fig. 17.1A). They photosynthesize throughout the
24-hour daylight, fixing CO2 and bubbling oxygen. The
cyanobacteria can grow into thick masses of biofilm, called
microbial mats (Fig. 17.1B). The mats support communities of protists and nematodes. Microbial ecologists such as
Jessica Trout-Haney, Dartmouth College, study what happens to microbial mats as the climate warms.
Antarctic microbial mats bear a striking resemblance to
Australian fossils that date to 3.48 billion years (gigayears,
or Gyr) before today (Fig. 17.1C). These fossils, from the
Dresser Formation, Pilbara Craton, were identified by geologist Nora Noffke, from Old Dominion University. The
fossils formed as silicate grains sedimented in the mat and
gradually replaced its organic structure. The sedimentary
layers and wrinkled surface remain visible after billions of
years. Remarkably, similar rock formations appear on Mars,
offering evidence that our neighbor planet, too, supported
ancient microbial life (shown in Chapter 1).

Note:

In geological description, a billion years (109) is a gigayear, or Gyr. A million years (106) is a megayear, or Myr.

Ancient microbes formed even more complex microbial
communities, called stromatolites (Fig. 17.2A). A stromatolite is a bulbous mass of layered limestone (calcium
carbonate, CaCO3) accreted by microbial mats. The mat
layers can build over centuries, even more than a thousand
years, reaching heights over 2 meters. The outermost layers
of the mat contain oxygenic phototrophs, such as diatoms
and filamentous cyanobacteria, that exude bubbles of oxygen. A few millimeters below the surface, red light supports
bacteria photolyzing H 2S to sulfate, which is then reduced

another kind of cross-feeding, like that shown by Caroline
Turner in the Long-Term Evolution Experiment.
Stromatolites today grow mainly in tidal pools whose
high salt concentration excludes predators, as in Hamlin
Pool, Shark Bay, Australia. But 3 billion years ago, stromatolites covered shallow seas all over Earth. Fossil stromatolites appear in Pilbara Craton’s 3.4-Gyr granite
(Fig. 17.2B). The rock layers preserve the wavy form of the
microbial mats, similar to living stromatolites.

the earliest fossil life shows organized structures such as a stromatolite built by cooperating cells. How could this be explained?

Conditions for life. How did Earth’s very fi rst life-forms

arise out of inert molecules? This process remains one of
the great mysteries of science. But we know certain things
that life required:

■

Temperature range permitting liquid water. Above
150°C, life’s macromolecules fall apart; below the freezing point of water, metabolic reactions cease. Maintaining the relatively narrow temperature range conducive
to life depends on the nature of our Sun, our planet’s
distance from the Sun, and the heat-trapping capacity of
our atmosphere.

Elements of Life

For life to arise and multiply, elements such as carbon and
oxygen needed to be available on Earth. The planet Earth
coalesced during formation of the solar system 4.5 Gyr ago.
Central to the solar system is our Sun, a “yellow” star of
medium size and surface temperature (5,770 K). The Sun’s
surface temperature generates electromagnetic radiation
across the spectrum, peaking in the range of visible light.
As we learned in Chapter 13, the photon energies of visible
light are sufficient to drive photosynthesis but not so energetic that they destroy biomolecules. Thus, the stellar class
of our Sun makes organic life possible.
The Sun’s surface temperature and luminosity are generated by nuclear fusion reactions in which hydrogen
nuclei fuse to form helium nuclei. (Be careful
to distinguish nuclear reactions, involving
nuclei, from chemical reactions, involving
electrons.) Besides hydrogen and helium,
2% of the solar mass consists of heavier
elements, such as carbon, nitrogen,
and oxygen, as well as traces of iron
and other metals—elements that
compose Earth, including its living
organisms. Where did these heavier

helium. In older stars, fusion of helium forms carbon, nitrogen,
oxygen, and all the heavier elements up through iron. Massive stars
explode as supernovas, spreading all the elements of the periodic
table across space. These elements are picked up by newly forming
stars, such as our own Sun.

Elements of life formed within stars.

Throughout the universe, young stars such
as our Sun fuse hydrogen to form helium. As
stars age, they use up all their hydrogen. With
hydrogen gone, the aging star contracts and its temperature rises, enabling helium nuclei to fuse, forming carbon
(see Fig. 17.3). Carbon drives a cyclic nuclear reaction, the
CNO (carbon-nitrogen-oxygen) cycle, to form isotopes of
nitrogen and oxygen. Subsequent nuclear reactions generate heavier elements through iron (Fe). In this way, the

CHAPTER 17

major elements of biomolecules were formed within stars
that aged before our solar system was born.
The later nuclear reactions of aging stars generate heavier
nuclei, as large as that of iron. The aging star expands,
forming a red giant (see Fig. 17.3). When a star of sufficient mass expands (becoming a supergiant), it explodes
as a supernova. The explosion of a supernova generates in a
brief time all the heaviest elements and ejects the entire contents of the star at near light speed. Billions of years before
our Sun was born, the first stars aged and died, spreading
all the elements of the periodic table across the universe.
Some of these elements coalesced with our Sun and formed
the planets of our solar system. In effect, all life on Earth is
made of stardust, the remains of stars long gone.

Thought Question

17.2 What would have happened to life on Earth if the Sun
were a different stellar class, substantially hotter or colder
than it is?

Elemental composition of Earth. When our solar sys-

tem formed, individual planets coalesced out of matter
attracted by the force of gravity. Because of Earth’s small
size, most of the hydrogen gas escaped Earth’s gravity very
early. The most abundant dense component of Earth was
iron (Fig. 17.4). Much of Earth’s iron sank to the center to form the core. The core is surrounded by a mantle, composed primarily of iron combined with less dense

crystalline minerals such as silicates of iron and magnesium:
(Fe,Mg)2SiO4. The mantle is coated by Earth’s thin outer
crust. The crust is composed primarily of silicon dioxide,
SiO2, also known as quartz or chert. Crustal rock contains
smaller amounts of numerous minerals, including the carbonates and nitrates that provided the essential elements
for life. Overall, the crust shows a redox gradient, reducing
in the interior and oxidizing at the surface.
The crust provides a habitat for microbes to surprising depths, such as within gold mines excavated down to
3 kilometers (km). Some endolithic microbes (microbes living within rock) metabolize by oxidizing electron donors
generated through decay of radioactive metals. The discovery of endolithic organisms deep in the crust was of great
interest to NASA scientists seeking life on Mars. Of the
planets, Mars most closely resembles Earth in geology and
distance from the Sun, and its crust might provide a habitat
similar to Earth’s.
The outer surface of the crust and the atmosphere above
it support the remainder of the biosphere, the sum total of
all life on Earth. The biosphere generates oxidants (electron
acceptors), most notably O2. Oxygen-breathing organisms
can live only on the outer surface, where O2 is produced by
photosynthesis.
Earth’s atmosphere. From the crust and the mantle of

early Earth, volcanic activity released gases such as carbon
dioxide and nitrogen, which formed Earth’s fi rst atmosphere, while volcanic water vapor formed the ocean. The
composition of this fi rst atmosphere, before life evolved,
looked much like that of Mars: thin, about 1% as dense
as that of Earth today, consisting primarily of CO2. But
unlike Mars, Earth developed living organisms that fi lled
the atmosphere with gaseous N2 and O2 and that continue to produce these gases today. Organisms also produce CO2, as well as fi xing it into biomass. Some CO2 and
N2 arise from geological sources such as volcanoes, but
their contribution is small compared to that of biological
cycles (discussed in Chapter 22). The overall composition
of Earth’s atmosphere is determined by living organisms,
primarily microbes.
Temperature. Another important aspect of Earth’s habitat,

determined by the atmospheric density and composition,
is temperature. Atmospheric gases absorb light and convert the energy to heat, raising the temperature of the surface and atmosphere. This rise in temperature is known as
the greenhouse effect. Because carbon dioxide is an especially potent greenhouse gas, the CO2-rich atmosphere of
early Earth could have heated the planet to temperatures
approaching those of Venus, eliminating the possibility of
life. Instead, microbial consumption of CO2 and generation of nitrogen and oxygen gases limited Earth’s surface

Chemical biosignatures. A different kind of biosignature

is given by organic molecules specific to a particular lifeform. Certain organic molecules may last within rock for
hundreds of millions of years. A particularly durable class
of molecules consists of membrane lipids. Recall from
Chapter 3 that some bacterial cell membranes contain steroid-like molecules called hopanoids. A hopanoid consists
of four or five fused rings of hydrocarbon with side groups
that vary depending on the kind of bacteria. The hopanoid
derivative 2-methylhopane is found in sedimentary rock of
the Hamersley Basin of Western Australia, dated to 2.5 Gyr
ago. This biosignature offers evidence that some kind of
bacteria existed by the end of the Archaean eon.

Banded Iron Formations
Reveal Oxidation by O2

An extraordinary event in the planet’s history was the evolution of the first oxygenic phototrophs: cyanobacteria that
split water to form O2. The entry of O2 into Earth’s biosphere is often portrayed as a sudden event that would have
been disastrous to microbial populations lacking defenses
against its toxicity. In fact, geological evidence shows
that oxygen arose gradually in the oceans, starting about
2 Gyr ago, and may have arisen and disappeared numerous times before reaching a high, steady-state level in our
atmosphere. The mechanism of the oxygen fluctuation is
unknown, but it caused cycles of aerobic and anaerobic
microbial metabolism.
Evidence for oxygen in the biosphere comes from the
oxidation state of minerals, particularly those containing
iron. The bulk of crustal iron is in the reduced form (Fe2+),
which is soluble in water and reached high concentrations

in the anoxic early oceans. Sedimentary rock, however,
contains many fine layers of oxidized iron (Fe3+), which
is insoluble and forms a precipitate, such as iron oxide
(Fe2O3). The layers of iron oxide suggest periods of alternating oxygen-rich and anoxic conditions. The layered rock
is called a banded iron formation (BIF) (Fig. 17.9A). A
common form of banded iron consists of gray layers of silicon dioxide (SiO2) alternating with layers colored red by
iron oxides and iron oxyhydroxides [FeOx(OH)y]. Banded
iron formations are widespread around the world and provide our major sources of iron ore (Fig. 17.9B).
Banded iron formations are often found in rock strata
containing signs of past life such as 13C depletion and other
biomarkers. For example, the Isua formations (Greenland)
and Hamersley formations (Western Australia), which both
show 13C depletion, also contain extensive banded iron.
Calculations indicate that the layers of oxidized iron could
result from biological metabolism involving iron oxidation.
One possibility is that chemolithotrophs oxidized the iron,
using molecular oxygen produced by cyanobacteria. The
Archaean and early Proterozoic eons experienced fluctuating levels of molecular oxygen in the atmosphere. These
fluctuations could have led to oscillating levels of iron
oxide, thus producing bands in the sediment, as microbes
used up all the oxygen.
Alternatively, Dianne Newman, at the California Institute
of Technology, proposes that the iron oxides arose directly
from anaerobic photosynthesis, in which the reduced iron
served as the electron donor (Fig. 17.10). In iron phototrophy, light excites an electron from Fe2+, oxidizing the ion
to Fe3+, while the excited electron cycles through an electron transport system to yield energy (discussed in Chapter 14). Newman discovered iron phototrophy in modern
purple bacteria such as Rhodopseudomonas palustris. In the

ancient Earth, photosynthetic oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+, or “photoferrotrophy,” could have occurred in cycles
until the marine iron was all oxidized, generating sedimentary layers
of iron oxides and iron oxyhydroxides.
Today, photoferrotrophs thrive in deep
anoxic lakes that resemble the anoxic
Archaean ocean.
By 2.3 Gyr ago, the prevalence of
oxidized iron and other minerals indicates the steady rise of oxygen from
photosynthesis in Earth’s atmosphere.
Most of the dissolved Fe2+ from the
ocean floor was oxidized, leaving the
oceans in the iron-poor state that persists today. As the most efficient electron acceptor, molecular oxygen
enabled the evolution of aerobic respiratory bacteria. Aerobic bacteria gave
rise to mitochondria, which enabled the
evolution of eukaryotes and, ultimately,
multicellular organisms (Fig. 17.11).
Remarkably, modern cells still consist mainly of reduced molecules,
highly reactive with oxygen—a relic
of the time when our ancestral cells
evolved in the absence of oxygen. The
conditions under which such cells may
have evolved can be simulated in the
laboratory. Conditions resembling our
model of early Earth spontaneously
generate some of life’s most common
molecules, such as adenine and simple amino acids (presented earlier, in
Special Topic 1.1). These simulation
experiments can never prove the actual
conditions under which life began, but
they can suggest testable models with
intriguing implications.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

Archaean rocks show evidence for life based on fossil
stromatolites, isotope ratios, and chemical biosignatures.
Fossil stromatolites appear in chert formations formed
3.4 Gyr ago. Isotope ratios for carbon indicate photosynthesis at 3.7 Gyr ago. Bacterial hopanoids appear at
2.5 Gyr ago.
Microfossils of filamentous and colonial prokaryotes
date to 2.0 Gyr ago. At 1.2 Gyr ago, larger fossil cells
resemble those of modern eukaryotes.
Banded iron formations reflect the cyclic increase and
decrease of oxygen produced by cyanobacteria and consumed through reaction with reduced iron. After all the
ocean’s iron was oxidized, oxygen increased gradually in
the atmosphere.

Early Metabolism

How did the earliest life-forms gain energy without oxygen
gas to respire and without the complex machinery of photosynthesis? The nature of the first metabolism is unknown,
but geochemistry and modern metabolism indicate several
features of the earliest living systems (Fig. 17.12A).
Oxidation-reduction reactions. The early oceans contained
oxidized forms of nitrogen, sulfur, and iron that could
interact with reduced minerals from the crust. For example, nitrate (NO3 –) or sulfate (SO42–) could be reduced by
hydrogen gas to yield energy (hydrogenotrophy; discussed
in Chapter 14). The oxidized molecules were generated by
reactions driven by ultraviolet radiation, which penetrated

isotope ratios (34S/32S) suggest the growth of sulfatereducing bacteria as early as 3.47 Gyr ago.
Light-driven ion pumps. A simple light-driven pump,
such as the bacteriorhodopsin of haloarchaea (halophilic
archaea), could have conducted the fi rst kind of phototrophy. The absorption spectrum of bacteriorhodopsin
matches the peak of solar radiation reaching the upper layers of ocean (Fig. 17.12B), in contrast to the chlorophylls
of cyanobacteria and anoxygenic bacteria, which absorb the
outer ranges of blue and red. Perhaps these chlorophyllusing bacteria evolved in the presence of haloarchaea, fi lling the unexploited photochemical niches.
Methanogenesis. Climate models of early Earth suggest a

methane atmosphere, produced by methanogenic archaea.
Methanogenesis involves reaction of H 2 and CO2 producing CH4 and H 2O. Methanogens show highly divergent
genomes—a fi nding that suggests early evolution of their
common ancestor. Their biochemistry and evolution (discussed in Chapter 19) are consistent with proposed models
of ancient life.

Models for the First Cells

Various models have been proposed to explain how the first
living cells originated from nonliving materials, and how
they replicated and evolved. Models for early life attempt
to address the following questions: In what kind of environment did the first cells form? What kind of metabolism
did the first cells use to generate energy? What was their
hereditary material?
Three kinds of models attempt to explain how nonliving materials gave rise to a cell. The prebiotic soup model
proposes that abiotic (nonliving) reactions involving

simple reduced chemicals such as ammonia and methane could have assembled complex organic molecules of
life. These complex macromolecules eventually acquired
the apparatus needed for self-replication and membrane
compartmentalization. Metabolist models propose that
central components of intermediary metabolism, including using the TCA cycle to generate amino acids, arose
from self-sustaining chemical reactions based on inorganic chemicals. These abiotic reactions then acquired
self-replicating macromolecules and membranes. Finally,
the RNA world is a model of early life in which RNA
performed all the informational and catalytic roles of
today’s DNA and proteins. The concept of an RNA world
draws upon genome sequences, which reveal thousands of
catalytic and structural RNAs.
The prebiotic soup. In the mid-twentieth century, bio-

chemists Aleksandr Oparin at Moscow University, and
Stanley Miller and Harold Urey at the University of Chicago, showed that organic building blocks of life such as
amino acids could arise abiotically out of a mixture of
water and reduced chemicals, including CH4, NH3, and
H 2 (Fig. 17.13). The mixture was subjected to an electrical discharge, similar to the lightning discharges that
arise from volcanic eruptions, which would have been
common in the late Hadean or early Archaean eon. The
chemical reaction produced fundamental amino acids
such as glycine and alanine. Similar experiments by Juan
Oró, at the University of Houston, showed the formation
of adenine by condensation of ammonia and hydrogen
cyanide.
The same amino acids and nucleobases arising from
early-Earth simulation are also found in meteorites, which
are believed to retain the chemistry of the early solar system
“frozen” in time. But unlike the chemical experiments, the
meteorites show a remarkable predominance of left-handed

mirror forms (L-enantiomers) of the amino acids—the
same L form utilized in the protein synthesis of all life on
Earth. Some researchers hypothesize that organic compounds formed in outer space were restricted to the L form
by an unknown process and then “seeded” the propagation
of L-form compounds in Earth’s prebiotic soup.
The original model conditions for the prebiotic soup
assumed that molecules in the early Archaean ocean were
largely reduced, with little or no oxygen present in the
atmosphere. More recent geochemical evidence suggests
that the early ocean actually included oxidized forms of
nitrogen, sulfur, and iron that arose through reactions
driven by ultraviolet radiation, which penetrated the atmosphere in the absence of the ozone layer. These oxidized
minerals could have reacted with the reduced crustal minerals, releasing energy to drive production of more complex
biomolecules.
Forming the first cell, or “proto-cell,” must have
required enclosing the first biochemical reactants within a
membrane-like compartment. Jack Szostak and colleagues
at Harvard Medical School investigate how such compartments can arise spontaneously from fatty acid glycerol
esters. The fatty acid derivatives are “amphipathic”; that
is, they possess both hydrophobic portions that associate
together and hydrophilic portions that associate with water.
In water, the fatty acid derivatives collect in “micelles”—
small, round aggregates in which the hydrophobic portions
associate in the interior and the hydrophilic portions associate with water. Under certain conditions, micelles can
aggregate to form hollow vesicles of membrane. Szostak
showed how the vesicles can take up molecules such as

origin of biosynthesis on the basis of CO2 fi xation, the
fundamental metabolism of all life today. Proponents of a
metabolist model, including Harold Morowitz at George
Mason University, and Günter Wächterhäuser at the University of Regensburg, propose that CO2-based metabolism
originated through self-sustaining reactions (Fig. 17.14A).
Simulation experiments suggest that such premetabolic reactions could have been catalyzed by metal sulfides prevalent
in the early ocean. For example, abiotic polymerization of
CO2 into TCA cycle intermediates may be catalyzed by FeS.
How did simple inorganic reactions lead to biochemical cycles involving more complex biopolymers, such as
nucleic acids and proteins? A major challenge is to explain
the genetic code by which nucleic acid codons are assigned
to unique amino acids. The genetic code may have arisen
from an earlier pretranslational mechanism of amino acid
biosynthesis (Fig. 17.14B). In this mechanism, proposed
by Morowitz and colleagues, each amino acid was originally synthesized from a TCA cycle acid complexed to a
dinucleotide. The dinucleotide later evolved into the first
two nucleotides of the codon specifying the amino acid.
The proposed link between a specific dinucleotide and each
amino acid would explain certain features of the genetic
code, such as the fact that most amino acids specified by
a codon starting with the same nucleotide are synthesized
from the same TCA cycle acid (discussed in Chapter 15).

The RNA world. Neither the prebiotic soup model nor the

metabolist models account for the evolution of macromolecules that encode complex information, such as nucleic
acids and proteins. A candidate for life’s fi rst “informational
molecule” is RNA. RNA is a relatively simple biomolecule,
with only four different “letters,” compared to the 20 standard amino acids of proteins. Its purine base adenine arises
spontaneously from ammonia and carbon dioxide under
conditions believed to resemble those of the Archaean eon.
Its ribose sugar is a fundamental building block of living
cells, with key roles in numerous biochemical pathways,
such as the Calvin cycle. Most exciting, in 2009, John
Sutherland and co-workers discovered an organic reaction
pathway that generates a sugar-base ribonucleotide in the
absence of any enzyme. This discovery suggests a way that
the fi rst RNA molecules could have formed before there
were living cells.
For several reasons, RNA is a better candidate than
DNA for the earliest information molecule. Compared
to DNA, RNA requires less energy to form and degrade.
RNA’s pyrimidine base uracil is formed early by biochemical pathways; only later is it converted to the thymine used
by DNA.
Most important, RNA molecules have been shown to
possess catalytic properties analogous to those of proteins.
Catalytic RNA molecules are called ribozymes. The first
ribozyme, discovered by Nobel laureate Thomas Cech in
the protist Tetrahymena, can splice introns in mRNA.
Other ribozymes actually catalyze synthesis of complementary strands of RNA, suggesting a model for early replication of RNA chromosomes. The most elaborate example of
catalytic RNA is found in the ribosome. X-ray crystallography of the ribosome reveals that the key steps of protein
synthesis, such as peptide bond formation, are actually catalyzed by the RNA components, not proteins (discussed in
Chapter 8). The ribosomal proteins possess relatively little
catalytic function; their main role seems to be protection
and structural support of the RNA.
Could RNA molecules have composed the earliest cells?
In 2009, Tracey Lincoln and Gerald Joyce at the Scripps
Research Institute devised a system in which two RNA
ribozymes catalyze each other’s synthesis. The ribozyme
model system suggests how, in the earliest cells, RNA
might have fulfilled the key functions that are today filled
by DNA and proteins, including information storage, replication, and catalysis (Fig. 17.15). This model is known as
the “RNA world.”
The prominent function of RNA in the ribosome, one of
life’s most ancient and conserved molecular machines, suggests a model for the transition from an RNA world to the
modern cell. In the ribosome, the actual steps of catalysis,
such as forming the peptide bond, are conducted by RNA
subunits acting as ribozymes. The ribozymes are stabilized

by protein subunits. Thomas Cech, Sidney Altman, and
colleagues propose that the earliest RNA components of
cells evolved by acquiring proteins to enhance stability. The
proteins helped prevent the tendency of RNA to hydrolyze (come apart in reaction with water). As cells evolved,
their peptide components increased through natural selection, and the RNA subunits may have shrunk by reductive
evolution (the evolutionary loss of unneeded parts). A few
complexes, such as the ribosome, still maintain their ribozymes; for others, perhaps all that remains are one or two
nucleotides. Dinucleotide cofactors such as NADH persist
in enzymes today, perhaps representing vestigial remnants
of the RNA world. For more on RNA evolution, and surprising applications for medicine, see eTopic 17.1.
The RNA-world model explains the central role of
RNA throughout the history of living cells. Yet the role
of RNA offers little clue as to the origins of cell compartmentalization and metabolism. No single model of life’s
origin yet addresses all the requirements for a living cell—
metabolism, membrane compartmentalization, and hereditary material. Each model does, however, offer important
insights into the evolutionary history and mechanisms of
life today.

evidence that organisms resembling today’s cyanobacteria

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

lived on Earth at least 2.5 Gyr ago, possibly 3.7 Gyr ago,
and that bacteria with anaerobic metabolism evolved as
early or earlier. Many intriguing questions remain. We outline here three unresolved questions regarding the temperature of early Earth, the role of methane in the early
atmosphere, and the actual source of Earth’s first cells.
Thermophile or psychrophile? The apparent existence of
life so soon after Earth cooled suggests a thermophilic
origin. Thermophily is supported by the fact that in the
domains Bacteria and Archaea, the deepest-branching
clades (that is, kinds of organisms that diverged the earliest
from others in the domain) are thermophiles. Such organisms could have thrived at hydrothermal vents, which offer
a continuous supply of H 2S and carbonates.
On the other hand, after meteoric bombardment abated,
early Earth should have become glacially cold. In the
Archaean, solar radiation was 20%–30% less intense than it
is today, and the thin CO2 atmosphere was insufficient to
increase the temperature by a greenhouse effect. A colder
habitat would support psychrophiles. Psychrophiles might
have had an advantage in an RNA world, given the thermal
instability of RNA compared to DNA and proteins.
A world of methane? Among Earth’s earliest life-forms

were methanogens (methane producers). Methanogens
are one of the most widely divergent groups of organisms
and persist today in environments ranging from anaerobic
sediment to the human intestine. Methanogenesis requires
only carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas, which would have
been plentiful in early anoxic sediment. The production
of methane, an extremely potent greenhouse gas, could
have greatly increased Earth’s temperature during the
Archaean eon. Thus, methanogenesis could explain how
Earth escaped the permanent freeze of Mars. Overheating
would have been halted when the oxygen gas produced by
cyanobacteria enabled growth of methanotrophs, bacteria
that oxidize methane. The decline of methane and the rise
of CO2 then would have brought about relative thermal
stability.
The debate over the temperature and climate of early
Earth has interesting implications for Earth today, when we
again face the prospect of massive global climate change.
Human agriculture favors explosive growth of methanogens, which threaten to accelerate global warming faster
than the biosphere can moderate it. Understanding the
climate of early Earth may help us better understand and
manage our own climate, discussed in Chapter 22.
Origin on Earth or elsewhere? Emerging evidence from
fossils and geochemistry has inexorably pushed back the
earliest known dates for several kinds of metabolism closer
to 3.7 Gyr ago (see Fig. 17.11). This implies that as soon

as Earth cooled to a temperature suitable for life, all the
fundamental components of cells evolved almost immediately. How could life, with all its diverse kinds of metabolism, have arisen so quickly?
The idea that life-forms originated elsewhere and
“seeded” life on Earth is called panspermia. Theories of
panspermia remain highly speculative. One hypothesis is
that microbial cells originated on Mars and were then carried to Earth on meteorites. As the solar system formed,
Mars would have cooled sooner than Earth, and because it
is also smaller than Earth, Mars’s weaker gravity would have
generated less bombardment by meteorites. Martian rocks
ejected into space by meteor impact have reached Earth, and
calculations based on simulated space habitats show that
microbes could survive such a journey. A Martian origin,
however, gains us only about half a billion years; it does not
really explain the origin of life’s complexity and diversity.
Did life-forms come from still farther away, perhaps borne
on interstellar dust from some other solar system?
A more likely explanation is that life evolved on early
Earth faster than it does today. Today, RNA viruses such
as influenza and HIV mutate and evolve much faster than
modern cells (discussed in Chapter 11). If early cells with
RNA genomes mutated as fast as viruses, they would have
evolved and diverged faster than cellular organisms that we
know today.

on Mars. How might such a find shed light on the origin and
evolution of life on Earth?

shortly after Earth cooled (4.0 Gyr ago). Simpler cells
existing before 4.0 Gyr ago may have evolved much faster
than life today. A more speculative possibility is that life
first evolved on another planet.

Microbial Phylogeny
and Gene Transfer

The unifying assumption of modern biology is genetic
relatedness, or molecular phylogeny. Phylogeny generates
a series of branching groups of related organisms called
clades. Each clade is a monophyletic group—that is,
a group of organisms that share a common ancestor not
shared by any kind of organism outside the clade. Each
monophyletic group then branches into smaller monophyletic groups, and ultimately species, the fundamental kind of organism (discussed in Section 17.5). The full
description of branching divergence of a species is called
its phylogeny. Phylogeny, however, consists of more than
branching divergence; the ancestry of all life-forms includes
horizontal gene transfer (discussed in Chapter 9). Both
vertical gene flow (parent to offspring) and horizontal gene
transfer shape all life-forms, including humans.

Divergence through Mutation
and Natural Selection

Populations of organisms diverge from each other through
several fundamental mechanisms of evolution. These
include:
■

Random mutation. DNA sequences change through
rare mistakes (in bacteria and archaea, typically one out
of a million base pairs) as the chromosome replicates
(discussed in Chapter 7). Replication errors result in
mutation. Most mutations are neutral; that is, they have
no effect on gene function.

■

Natural selection and adaptation. In a given environment, natural selection favors organisms that produce greater numbers of offspring in that environment

■

ORIGINS AND EVOLUTION

■

(discussed in Section 17.4). Genes encoding traits under
selection pressure may show mutation frequencies much
higher or lower than those generated by the random
mutation rate. Natural selection enables a population to
adapt to a changing environment.
■

Reductive evolution (degenerative evolution). In the
absence of selection for a trait, the genes encoding the
trait accumulate mutations without affecting the organism’s reproductive success. Because mutations that
decrease function are more common than mutations
that improve function, accumulating mutations without selection pressure leads to decline and ultimately
loss of the trait. The loss or mutation of DNA encoding unselected traits is called reductive evolution (or
degenerative evolution).

Random mutations with neutral effects that are not subject to selection tend to accumulate at a steady rate over
generations because the error rate of the DNA replication
machinery stays about the same. The resulting “genetic
drift” causes sequences in separate populations to diverge
over time. The constancy of the mutation rate (within limits) provides a tool for us to measure the time of divergence
of organisms based on their DNA sequences.

Thought Question

17.5 What kinds of DNA sequence changes have no effect on

gene function? (Hint: Refer to the table of the genetic code,
Figure 8.10.)

Molecular Clocks Are Based
on Mutation Rate

An important conceptual advance of the twentieth century
was that information contained in a macromolecule such
as protein or DNA could measure the history of a species.
The temporal information contained in a macromolecular sequence is called a molecular clock. Molecular clocks
have revolutionized our understanding of the emergence
of all living organisms, including human beings. The first
molecular clocks, based on protein sequencing and DNA
hybridization, were developed in the 1960s. Subsequently,
the sequences of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) were used by
Carl Woese to reveal the divergence of three domains of
life. The rRNA sequence is particularly useful because ribosome structure and function are highly similar across all
organisms. Genome sequences now offer many other genes
to measure divergence at different levels of classification.
A molecular clock is based on the acquisition of new
random mutations in each round of DNA replication. In

The gene has the same function across all types of
organisms compared. That is, all versions are orthologous; they have not evolved to serve different functions.
Functional difference may lead to different rates of change.
The generation time is the same for all organisms
compared. Shorter generation times (more frequent
reproductive cycles) lead to overestimates of the overall
time of divergence because of the increased opportunity
for DNA mutation.
The average mutation rate remains constant among
organisms and across generations. If different kinds of
life mutate at different rates, then organisms with more
rapid rates of mutation will appear to have diverged over
a longer time than is actually the case.

In practice, these requirements are never fulfilled exactly,
but we do the best we can. Genes that show the most consistent measures of evolutionary time encode components
of the transcription and translation apparatus, such as ribosomal RNA and proteins, tRNA, and RNA polymerase. The
most widely used molecular clock is the gene encoding the
small-subunit rRNA (SSU rRNA). The SSU rRNA is also
known by its sedimentation coefficient: 16S rRNA (bacteria)

the ancestor of the other sequences). The relative differences among the sequences can be used to propose a tree
of divergence (Fig. 17.17C). In the tree, the length of
each branch is proportional to the number of differences
between two sequences. The number of differences, or
divergence, is given by 100% minus the percent similarity
between the aligned sequences.
In practice, a much larger amount of sequence with multiple differences is needed to calculate a phylogenetic tree.
All trees are based on probability, with ambiguities depending on the assumptions of how sequences change. The data
are calculated by computer programs, which may yield different results, depending on their assumptions. Standard
assumptions include the following:
■

Minimum number of changes. The best alignment
between two sequences is that which assumes the smallest number of mutational changes.

■

Functional sequences change more slowly. Sequences
that encode essential catalytic portions of the gene product are maintained by selection pressure and change
more slowly than portions of the molecule without
essential function.

■

Third-base codon positions show more random
change. In a protein-coding gene, many codons have
multiple anticodons that differ at the third base, so
third-base changes are least likely to change the amino
acid. Thus, third-base nucleotides offer the best molecular clock information.

Phylogenetic Trees

Once homologous sequences are aligned, the frequency
of differences between them can be used to generate a
phylogenetic tree that estimates the relative amounts of

■

evolutionary divergence between the sequences. If divergence rate over time, or mutation rate, is the same for all
sequences compared, then divergence data can be used to
infer the length of time since two organisms shared a common ancestor.
A phylogenetic tree is a model. All phylogenetic trees
depend on complex mathematical analysis to measure
degrees of divergence and propose a tree that most probably
connects present sequences with their common ancestor.
Because we can never know the exact tree with certainty,
different types of calculations may lead to slightly different
results. Two common approaches are:
■

Maximum parsimony. Evolutionary distances are
computed for all pairs of taxa based on the numbers of
nucleotide or amino acid substitutions between them.
A proposed common ancestor, or “ancestral state,” is
reconstructed. All possible trees comparing relative time
of divergence from the common ancestor are computed.
The “best fit” tree is defined as the one requiring the
fewest mutations to fit the data (that is, the one that
is most “parsimonious”). A limitation of parsimonious
reconstruction is that more than one tree may produce
results consistent with the data.

■

Maximum likelihood. For each possible tree, one
calculates the likelihood (probability) that such a tree
would have produced the observed DNA sequences.
The probability of given mutations is based on complex
statistical calculations. Maximum-likelihood methods
require large amounts of computation but obtain the
most information from the data, usually generating one
tree or a small set of probable trees.

A portion of a computed phylogenetic tree is shown in

researchers argue that all branches become bushy once
enough strains have been sequenced.
How do we calibrate a phylogenetic tree—that is, relate
the number of mutations to the time since divergence? We
need an external measure of time. A tree can be calibrated
if some kind of fossil evidence or geological record exists
to confirm at least one branch point of the tree. But for
microbes, such fossil calibrations remain speculative. One
convincing method of calibration is to correlate the divergence of microbial species growing only inside of particular host species with the divergences of their hosts, based
on the host fossil record. For example, the exceedingly
rapid divergence of Buchnera species (Fig. 17.19) can be
calibrated on the basis of their host insects. Such calculations, however, reveal vastly divergent rates of evolutionary
change in different bacterial taxa.
Could a life-form mutate even faster than Buchnera?
Some RNA viruses, such as HIV, mutate so fast that
they form multiple strains within one host (discussed in
Chapter 11).

Carl Woese first used SSU rRNA phylogeny to reveal the
existence of a third kind of life, Archaea, roughly as distant
from bacteria as from eukaryotes (Fig. 17.20). The three
fundamental groups of life-forms—Archaea, Bacteria, and
Eukarya—are termed domains. How was an entire domain
of life missed in the past? Many archaea grow in habitats
previously thought inhospitable for life; for example, Thermoplasma species grow at 60°C and pH 2 (Fig. 17.21).
Others, such as methanogens and halophiles, were long
known to microbial ecologists, but without tools for
genetic analysis they were simply classified among bacteria.

on their commonalities with organisms of importance to
humans. For example, investigators of intron splicing in

archaea argue that archaea represent a model system for
related processes in complex eukaryotes such as humans.
The root, however, can be found only by measuring
divergence relative to an outside group of organisms. Since
no “outgroup” exists for the tree of all life, how is the tree
rooted? One approach is to compare a pair of homologous
genes within one organism—homologs that diverged from
a common ancestral gene and acquired distinct functions
(paralogs). The pair of paralogs chosen for analysis must
have diverged within the common ancestral cell before the
divergence of the three domains of life. The early divergence is determined by comparing the pair’s sequence similarity in many different organisms and constructing a tree
of gene phylogeny. A limitation of this approach is that
genes with different functions have been subjected to natural selection in addition to random variation.
Most phylogenetic data so far indicate a root between
Bacteria and the common ancestor of Archaea and Eukarya;
that is, Bacteria diverged from Archaea and Eukarya before
Archaea and Eukarya diverged from each other. While the
position of the root remains controversial, the three major
divisions of life based on rRNA phylogeny have been confirmed by sequence data from the numerous genomes
published to date. Furthermore, structural and physiological comparison of the three domains largely confirms
the rRNA tree (Table 17.2). Note first that all living cells
on Earth share profound similarities. All cells consist of
membrane-enclosed compartments that shelter the same
fundamental apparatus of cell production: the DNA-RNAprotein machine. The fundamental components of this
machine appear to have evolved before the three domains
diverged from their last universal common ancestor. From
a molecular standpoint, all cells on Earth appear more similar than they are different.
Nonetheless, important differences emerge between
each pair of domains; indeed, each domain shows distinctive traits absent or scarce in the other two. We summarize
here the major features common to most members of each
domain. Various classes and species within each domain are
explored in Chapters 18–20.
Archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. Of the three domains,

the eukaryotes stand out as having a nucleus and other
complex membranous organelles (see Table 17.2). Eukaryotic organelles include mitochondria and chloroplasts,
which evolved from internalized bacteria. Bacteria and
archaea possess no nucleus and have relatively simple intracellular membranes. Their size is limited by diffusion across
the cell membrane, with occasional exceptions, such as the
“giant bacterium” Epulopiscium fishelsoni. The larger size
and complexity of eukaryotic cells mean that they generally
require the most highly powered sources of energy, such as
aerobic respiration and oxygenic photosynthesis, although

some protists conduct fermentation. By contrast, the prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) employ a wider range of
metabolic alternatives, including lithotrophy and anaerobic respiration. Finally, eukaryotic plants and animals have
attained a degree of multicellular complexity unknown in
the prokaryotic domains.
On the other hand, eukaryotes share key traits with
archaea that distinguish both from bacteria. The core
information machinery of eukaryotes more closely resembles that of archaea. The two domains share closely related
components of the central DNA-RNA-protein machine:
RNA polymerase, ribosomes, and transcription factors.
Even such hallmarks of eukaryotes as intragenic introns,
the splicing machinery, and the “RNA interference” regulatory complexes are found in archaea. All this explains
why rRNA trees place archaea closer to eukaryotes than to
bacteria.
Nevertheless, eukaryotes share fundamental structures
with bacteria that differ from those in archaea. Archaea
possess unique cell membrane components, such as their
ether-linked lipids (see Chapter 19). Outside the archaea,
ether-linked membrane lipids are found only in deepbranching bacterial species that share habitat (and exchange
genes) with hyperthermophilic archaea. Only the domain
Archaea includes species capable of growth in the most
“extreme” environments of temperature (above 110°C or
below –20°C) and pH (below pH 1). At the same time,
many other archaeal species grow well at mesophilic temperatures in soil or water. Perhaps the most striking distinction of archaea is the complete absence of archaeal
pathogens of animals or plants. Even the many methanogens that live within animal digestive tracts have never
been shown to cause disease.
Overall, the three-domain phylogeny divides life usefully
into three distinctive groups. Yet the tree also shows signs
of gene flow unaccounted for by monophyletic descent. The
eukaryotes contain mitochondria derived from assimilated
bacteria whose genomes persist within the organelle. And
pathogenic bacteria such as Agrobacterium species transfer DNA into the genomes of plants. Moreover, sequenced
genomes reveal evidence of gene transfer between bacteria
and archaea sharing high-temperature habitats. What if the
tree of life is not strictly monophyletic?

Horizontal Gene Transfer

In retrospect, the very first demonstration of the molecular basis of heredity—the transformation of avirulent Pneumococcus to virulence in 1928—involved horizontal gene
transfer (or lateral gene transfer). Horizontal gene transfer is the acquisition of a piece of DNA from another cell,
as distinguished from vertical gene transfer, the transmission of an entire genome from parent to offspring.

Among bacteria and archaea, DNA is transferred horizontally by plasmids, transposable elements, and bacteriophages, as well as through the process of transformation,
as discussed in Chapter 9. For example, drug resistance
genes are transferred from harmless human-associated bacteria to pathogens. Another example is the transfer of genes
encoding light-driven proton pumps (bacteriorhodopsin)
from halophilic archaea into marine bacteria. Such transfer
events are relatively rare, occurring perhaps once in a million generations. But over time, the number of such “rare”
events can accumulate.
How can we tell when a genome contains DNA sequence
“transferred” from a distant relative? One sign of horizontal transfer is a DNA sequence whose GC/AT ratio (proportion of GC and AT base pairs) differs from the rest of
the genome. A surprising proportion of genomic DNA can
show “spikes” of GC content that differ from the GC/AT
ratio of neighboring sequences. These regions of anomalous GC/AT ratio indicate origin elsewhere, even from
species of a different domain. In some archaea, particularly the hyperthermophiles Pyrococcus and Aeropyrum,
10%–20% of the genes appear to come from bacteria that
share their high-temperature environment. On the other
hand, the thermophilic bacterium Thermotoga maritima
shows a number of genes transferred from archaea.
Between more closely related taxa, genes migrate even
faster. For example, the Escherichia coli genome acquired
about 18% of its genes from closely related species after its
relatively recent divergence from the close relative Salmonella enterica. Some medically important genera, such as
Neisseria (which causes gonorrhea and meningitis), are particularly “recombinogenic.” Rapid gene exchange enables
pathogens to avoid the host immune system by expressing novel proteins not recognized by host antibodies. Furthermore, the genomes of eukaryotes include many genes
acquired from bacteria, most of them from the endosymbiotic ancestors of their mitochondria and chloroplasts (discussed in Section 17.6).
How does horizontal gene transfer affect microbial phylogeny? In 1999, Ford Doolittle, at Dalhousie University,
redrew the standard tree of life with a bewildering array of
cross-cutting lineages to show how actual phylogeny combines horizontal and vertical transfer (Fig. 17.22). Perhaps
the “last common ancestor” was actually a last common
community of diverse life-forms that contributed different
parts of our genetic legacy.

Gene flow model for two diverging species

Generations over time

assumes that some classes of genes nearly always transmit vertically—particularly “informational genes,” which
specify products essential for transcription and translation. Informational genes include RNA polymerase, as
well as ribosomal RNAs such as SSU rRNA, and elongation factors. Informational genes need to interact directly
in complex ways with large numbers of cellular components; thus, their capacity for horizontal transfer is limited.
On the other hand, “operational genes” are those whose
products govern metabolism, stress response, and pathogenicity. Operational genes function with relative independence from other cell components and consequently move
more easily among distantly related organisms, particularly
organisms that share the same habitat. An important category of such movable genes is virulence factors. Pathogens
show extensive horizontal transfer of virulence genes and
genes encoding resistance to host defenses and antibiotics.
Groups of such genes are often transferred together on
plasmids or on genomic islands, regions of DNA of foreign origin that confer special properties, such as virulence
or nitrogen fixation (discussed in Section 9.6). Examples of
a virulence plasmid and a genomic island are found in the
deadly pathogen E. coli O157:H7 (eTopic 17.3). But in some
cases, the group of genes transferred is so large that it makes
up a substantial chunk of an organism’s genome. For example, the Aquificales group of thermophilic bacteria includes a
large section derived from Proteobacteria similar to E. coli—
so large that the Aquificales phylogeny remains unclear.
A balanced view of vertical and horizontal gene transfer is shown in Figure 17.23. The row of arrows designates vertical transfer of the bulk of the genomes of the two
diverging species. Black lines represent vertically transferred
genes, such as ribosomal RNA; gray lines indicate genes
with more flexible function. At various levels, colored lines
indicate horizontal transfer, where genes enter each lineage
by processes such as conjugation or transformation. Gray
lines peel out, indicating loss of a gene by mutation. Overall, the vertical lineage persists for most of the core informational genes (black lines), while horizontally acquired genes
enter the genome. The persistence of genes showing vertical
inheritance in nearly all life (such as SSU rRNA) may reflect
the phylogeny of the organism as a whole, despite the other
genes that are transferred horizontally. But to fully assess
phylogeny, we must sequence entire genomes.

Different sequences diverge at different rates.
Under selection pressure, the actual divergence rates
of sequences depend on structure and function of the
RNA or protein products.
Phylogenetic trees are based on sequence analysis.
The more different the two sequences are, the longer is
the branch representing time since divergence from the
common ancestor. Rooting a tree requires comparison
with an outgroup.
The tree of life diverges to three domains: Bacteria,
Archaea, and Eukarya. Eukaryotes are distinguished
by the nucleus, which is lacking in archaea and bacteria. Archaea possess ether-linked isoprenoid lipids that
are rare or absent in bacteria and eukaryotes, and they
are never pathogens. The machinery of archaeal gene
expression resembles that of eukaryotes.
Genes transfer between different species. Horizontal
transfer is most frequent between closely related species
or between distantly related species that share a common habitat. Informational genes with many molecular interactions transfer vertically, whereas operational

genes that function independently of other components
are more likely to transfer horizontally.

Horizontal gene transfer is important for adaptation to new environments and for pathogenesis. Gene
transfer among pathogenic and nonpathogenic strains
leads to emergence of new pathogens.

17.4

Adaptive Evolution

In discussing phylogeny, we focused on the accumulation of random mutations that cause genome sequences to
diverge at a steady rate. The rate of nonselected sequence
changes enables us to measure evolutionary time. But how
does evolution help life survive in a new environment?
Adaptive evolution requires natural selection. In natural
selection, the genetic variants that arise by random mutation differ in their chance of survival. Those variants that
survive to leave more offspring undergo “selection”; that is,
their traits are overrepresented in the next generation. Over
many generations, the descendants develop traits very different from those of their ancestors.
How can we study adaptive evolution—especially the
evolution of different species, which takes place over millions of years? We have several kinds of evidence:
■

Genomic analysis. Comparing gene sequences, both
within and between genomes, enables us to track how
organisms adapted in the past.

■

Strongly selective environments. Environments under
intensive selective pressure, such as high-temperature
habitats or exposure to antibiotics, lead to rapid evolution.

■

Experimental evolution. Experimental strategies reveal
evolution in the laboratory, enabling us to test predictive
models.

Genomic Analysis

As discussed in Section 17.3, the sequence of genomes
reveals descent over time based on steady accumulation of
mutations. But other mutations undergo selection that provides a cell with new functions. A common way this happens is by gene duplication.
As cells replicate their DNA over many generations (discussed in Chapter 9), occasionally the DNA polymerase will
make a duplicate copy of a gene. With duplicate copies of a
gene, one copy may acquire mutations that change its function without detriment to the organism because the “backup”
copy still functions. Now, suppose the mutated copy gains
additional mutations that further alter its function, providing
a new function to the cell. For example, a gene encoding a
transporter for one sugar may now encode a transporter that

better “fits” a different sugar. The two paralogous genes,
or paralogs, have evolved to serve different functions. Paralogs are a major source of raw material that contributes to
new functions arising through evolution. We can detect paralogs in a genome, through sequence relatedness; for example,
the genome of the hyperthermophilic bacterium Thermotoga
maritima shows paralogous ABC transporters for lactose,
cellobiose, mannose, and xylose, among others. Evolution of
paralogs provides an important way for organisms to enhance
fitness in a complex environment.
Does a population ever lose some of its paralogs? Certain environments select for loss of many genes—a phenomenon called degenerative, or reductive, evolution.
The selection for loss is “positive” because organisms save
energy by avoiding replication and expression of unneeded
genes. Intracellular pathogens and obligate symbionts
often lose large chunks of their genome, by processes such
as intracellular recombination of the chromosome. The lost
genes typically encoded functions supplied by the host,
such as capture of nutrients and generation of energy. Lost
genes can be identified by comparison with free-living species. For example, Treponema pallidum, the cause of syphilis, has a genome of 1.1 million base pairs, which is about
a quarter the size of the E. coli genome. T. pallidum has
lost all of its enzymes used in the TCA cycle, respiration,
and amino acid biosynthesis. These genes remain in the
genomes of free-living treponemes.
In other species, dilute, nutrient-poor natural environments select for gene reduction. Marine cyanobacteria, a
major source of global photosynthesis, have lost numerous genes that confer little advantage in the open ocean.
Missing genes encode transporters for sugars and amino
acids (which are scarce in the ocean) as well as proteins for
flagellar motility and pili. More surprising, Prochlorococcus species have lost catalase, an enzyme that destroys the
hydrogen peroxide they produce. Their hydrogen peroxide
is detoxified by catalase-positive bacteria that share their
marine habitat. Erik Zinser at the University of Tennessee–
Knoxville showed that Prochlorococcus could be cultured on
agar only in the presence of partner bacteria that supply
catalase. Given that catalase is an expensive enzyme to produce, Prochlorococcus may have gained an advantage when
this enzyme was deleted during its evolution in the nutrient-poor open ocean.

Strongly Selective Environments

Evolution requires many generations, but certain microbes
may produce 40 generations in a day. When such microbes
are under strong selection pressure, such as the presence of an
antibiotic, evolution may occur surprisingly fast. In the case
shown in Figure 17.24, a hospitalized patient was infected
by MRSA, a deadly strain of Staphylococcus aureus that had
already evolved resistance to drugs such as methicillin. The

The “fittest” trait depends on the
environment in which selection
occurs. The presence of an antibiotic
selects individuals that are resistant,
despite slower growth (small-colony
size). Without the antibiotic, the
faster-growing individuals prevail.

Rapid adaptive evolution may be
enhanced by disabling regulation.
In this case, the ppGpp stress regulon was derepressed, enabling stress
responses that normally would be

growth.

Experimental Evolution
in the Laboratory

The process of evolution can be studied in the laboratory—an approach known as experimental evolution or
laboratory evolution. A landmark experiment on evolution in the laboratory was performed by Richard Lenski
at Michigan State University (Fig. 17.25 and eTopic 17.4).

patient was an elderly man with a weakened immune system,
unable to eliminate even small populations of an opportunistic pathogen such as MRSA. The original culture from
the patient’s blood showed bacteria sensitive to four antibiotics. But prolonged exposure resulted in natural selection for
resistance. Ultimately, following a total of 12 weeks’ exposure to linezolid (one of the last antibiotics effective against
MRSA), the bacteria isolated showed resistance to three
other antibiotics plus partial resistance to linezolid.
In Figure 17.24, note that the latest drug-resistant strain
actually made smaller colonies with or without the drug—
the “small-colony variant.” In other words, natural selection
yielded a population that was the “fittest” under a particular environmental condition—the presence of linezolid in
an immunocompromised host—where even a slow-growing
strain could persist. In the absence of the drug, the original
strain would outcompete the small-colony variant.
In the case just described, what was the molecular basis
of the multidrug resistance? Researchers obtained DNA
from the patient’s original MRSA, as well as the later
small-colony variant. They sequenced the two genomes
and compared them. Just three point mutations in the
small-colony variant accounted for the drug resistance, as
well as the retarded growth. One of these mutations derepressed a stress regulon (group of genes under one regulator), causing accumulation of the stress signal ppGpp
(guanosine tetraphosphate). The ppGpp stress regulon
includes expression of many protective genes that enable a
cell to survive in the presence of antibiotics. But the cost
to the cell of expressing this regulon is a slower growth
rate; like a community under “terror alert,” the cell’s normal everyday processes are slowed by the demands of the
stress response.

Evolution of citrate utilization in E. coli.

A. One or more of the mutations accumulated over 30,000
generations potentiated evolution of the Cit+ trait. The Cit+ trait
first appeared in about generation 31,000. Subsequent mutations
refined the phenotype, increasing the rate of citrate utilization.
Ball symbols indicate genomes from the population’s history that
were sequenced for analysis. B. The Cit+ mutation. After 31,000
generations, a tandem duplication event placed a copy of the
rnk promoter, which directs expression when oxygen is present,
upstream of the citT gene encoding a citrate/succinate antiporter
that is normally repressed by oxygen. This new rnk-citT module
now expresses CitT, which takes up citrate, allowing bacteria to
respire on citrate from the medium. Source: Adapted from Zachary Blount
et al. 2012. Nature 489:513.

The Cit+ mutation arose initially as a
weak ability to transport citrate in the presence of oxygen, and therefore to respire on citrate. The genetic basis
of this mutation was found to be a tandem duplication
of a gene encoding a citrate/succinate antiporter, citT
(Fig. 17.27B). Because the antiporter excretes succinate,
the Cit+ phenotype causes a metabolic imbalance—but
this imbalance gets corrected by the potentiating mutation
for acetate utilization, gltA. The duplicated citT (upstream
of the first copy) happens to include a promoter for an
adjacent gene, rnk, which encodes a regulator of nucleic acid
metabolism, expressed in the presence of oxygen. Thus, the
duplication places citT expression under control of the copied rnk promoter. The rnk promoter now expresses citT in
the presence of oxygen, enabling the cell to respire on citrate.
The history of the initial Cit+ clone thus required two
rare events: the potentiating mutation, gltA; and the tandem duplication of citT-rnk, which placed citT expression
under control of a promoter active in the presence of oxygen.
Refinement of the phenotype. The earliest Cit+ clones

were very poor at growing on the citrate. But later clones
evolved as a result of mutations that increased the rate of
citrate utilization—that is, by evolutionary refi nement of
the Cit+ trait. The researchers showed that this improvement was due to an increase in the copy number of the
duplicated segment that produces the rnk-citT module,
which increased the number of expressed copies of citT.
This improved growth on citrate eventually led the Cit+
clones to dominate the population. Interestingly, though,
even the “refi ned” Cit+ cells never fully took over the cultures. Some cells always remained that had adapted to
limiting glucose by other means. We saw the example of
Caroline Turner’s mutant (Current Research Highlight),
which evolved to metabolize the succinate and other fourcarbon acids excreted by Cit+ clones.

Thought Question

17.8 The evolution of clones requiring nutrients from other

clones may be more common than expected. How might the
mechanisms of evolution favor the emergence of dependent clones?

The results of Lenski’s Long-Term Evolution Experiment raise this question: If E. coli is evolving new traits,
is it in the process of evolving a new species? We address
the species concept next (Section 17.5). Meanwhile,
beyond the philosophical debates, industrial laboratories now use advanced forms of experimental evolution.
Evolution can improve commercial enzymes—and even
develop new products. For example, Bernhard Palsson
and colleagues at UC San Diego used laboratory evolution to evolve a strain of Streptomyces to produce high
concentrations of a novel antibiotic against MRSA. Others take evolution to an extreme: Could we generate in
vitro all the possible mutants of an organism, and set
them against each other all at once? Such an approach is
called directed evolution. An example of directed evolution is the development of hyperthermophilic forms of a
xylanase enzyme used for paper production (discussed in
Special Topic 17.1).

Adaptive evolution requires natural selection.
Genomic analysis tracks how organisms adapted in

evolve paralogous genes with different functions.
Degenerative (reductive) evolution happens when
unneeded genes are lost from the genome. The organism saves energy by avoiding their replication and
expression.
Strongly selective environments, such as antibiotic
exposure, reveal rapid evolution.
Selective pressure depends on the particular environment. A trait favored in one environment may be disadvantageous in another.
Experimental evolution in the laboratory enables us to
test hypotheses about natural selection. Richard Lenski’s
Long-Term Evolution Experiment shows potentiation to
achieve useful mutations; actualization of a novel mutant
phenotype; and refinement, or increasing the degree of
the phenotype. Laboratory evolution is used widely in
industrial development.

17.5

Microbial Species
and Taxonomy

What is a species? Among eukaryotes, a species is defined
by the principle that members of different species do not
normally interbreed. Thus, the failure to interbreed is the
traditional property that distinguishes species. Bacteria
and archaea, however, transfer genes horizontally between
distantly related clades. So the definition of bacterial species is complex, subject to heated debate among microbiologists. Also much debated is the classifying of life-forms
into different kinds (classification) and the naming of
species (taxonomy).

Note:

Distinguish these terms:

Classification is the sorting of life-forms into bins (categories)
based on genetic relatedness and traits of the organisms.
Nomenclature is the naming of categories, including species.
Taxonomy is the classification and naming of organisms.

Defining a Species

As genome sequence data became available for microbes,
scientists hoped that quantitative measures of divergence
could provide a consistent basis for defining microbial species. But for some organisms, such as Helicobacter pylori,
the genomes of different strains that cause the same disease (gastritis) differ by as much as 7%. On the other
hand, strains of Bacillus with nearly identical genomes
cause completely different diseases, such as anthrax
(B. anthracis) and caterpillar infection (the biological pesticide B. thuringiensis). Even more puzzling, hyperthermophilic bacteria such as Aquifex aeolicus show a high
proportion of genes from the domain Archaea! Some
researchers argue that the species concept lacks meaning
for microbes.
Amid the debates, microbiologists generally agree on
the importance of two perspectives: phylogeny (based on
DNA relatedness) and ecology (based on shared traits and
ecological niche).
Phylogenetic relatedness. A species is a group of individuals that share relatedness of a key set of “housekeeping
genes,” typically informational genes such as ribosomal and
transcriptional components. Ideally, these genes should all
be orthologs (genes with a common origin and function),
not paralogs (which diverged from a common ancestor but
now differ in function). Within a genus, species that cannot
be distinguished by SSU rRNA alone may be defi ned by
analysis of multiple genes. For example, analysis of multiple gene loci effectively distinguishes Neisseria meningitidis

CHAPTER 17

(the cause of meningitis) from Neisseria lactamica, a harmless resident of the nasopharynx. The multigene approach
has proved successful even in the case of highly “recombinogenic” organisms known to acquire and rearrange
genes readily.

genomic relatedness, a species should include individuals
that share common traits and an ecological niche, or “ecotype.” Shared traits should include cell shape and nutritional requirements, and there should be a common habitat
and life history (for example, causing the same disease). By
these criteria, highly divergent strains of Helicobacter pylori
causing gastritis make up one species, whereas Bacillus
anthracis (anthrax) and Bacillus thuringiensis (caterpillar
infection) are different species despite their highly similar
genomes.
A working definition of species. While the debate goes

on, many microbiologists accept the following criteria for a
working defi nition of a microbial species:
■

SSU rRNA identity ≥95%. Two organisms with 95% or
greater similarity in SSU rRNA sequence generally are
considered to share the same genus. Beyond the genus
level, rRNA sequence lacks resolution.

■

Whole-genome similarity: average nucleotide identity (ANI) of orthologs ≥95%. Within whole genomes,
we can define all the orthologous genes (orthologs,
genes of the same function) that two strains share. If
the strains share 95% or greater ANI for their orthologs,
they may be considered the same species.

■

Shared ecotype. If two organisms with 95% or greater
identity share a common habitat and metabolism, or
cause the same disease, they are considered the same
species.

This working definition classifies most known bacteria in a way that reconciles phylogeny with ecotype. For
example, Helicobacter pylori genomes with a common gastric pathology show exceptional variation due to horizontal
gene transfer, even including their SSU rRNA genes. Nevertheless, a set of orthologs can be defined that share 95%
ANI.
At the same time, new questions arise from the availability of multiple sequenced genomes for a single species.
Suppose that every time we sequence a new isolate from
nature, or from a clinical specimen, we find that every new
genome sequenced has a few new genes absent from previously sequenced isolates. How, then, do we define the
gene map? This situation would be unheard of for animals
and plants, in which the gene map is fixed by Mendelian
recombination. It is common, however, for bacteria such

pathogen (Fig. 17.28). For each new genome sequenced,
several hundred new genes are identified that are absent
from all the other genomes so far. In a pathogen, some of
these new genes could be involved in pathogenesis, with
profound implications for medical therapy and vaccine
development.
Should we now attempt to define bacterial and archaeal
genomes not just by a single sequenced genome, but by
the sum total of all expected genes in all possible isolates?
This theoretical total is called the pan-genome. The pangenome includes genes present in all sequenced genomes
of a species (known as its core genome) plus “accessory
genes” present in one or more sequenced isolates. But how
do we estimate the size of a pan-genome for a given species? A statistical model can predict the chance of finding
new genes every time we sequence another genome. A few
species, such as the anthrax agent Bacillus anthracis, have
a “closed” pan-genome that appears to be defined by a relatively small number of natural isolates. But for Bacillus
cereus (Fig. 17.28), after the first ten genomes, each new
genome still reveals another 250 genes. Amazingly, the B.
cereus pan-genome appears to be infinite in size! This is
called an “open” pan-genome. Other species with open
pan-genomes include the pneumonia pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae, the marine cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus
marinus, and the halophilic archaeon Haloquadratum walsbyi. Open pan-genomes may well predominate in nature;

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

SPECIAL TOPIC 17.1, , Jump-Starting Evolution of a Hyperthermophilic Enzyme
What commercial product is used to make chicken feed more
digestible, to improve the texture of cotton fabric, to bake better bread, and to make paper using less bleach? The answer is
xylanase, an enzyme that cleaves plant polysaccharides containing a variety of sugar monomers, such as the five-carbon
sugar xylose. Xylanases are made by many different types
of bacteria and fungi, and different xylanases have evolved
naturally to function best under different conditions. But for
commercial use, we need to fine-tune evolution to optimize
the enzyme for particular uses: a xylanase for animal feed,
another xylanase for baking, and yet another for treatment of
paper pulp. The paper pulp application imposes particularly
demanding conditions of high pH and high temperature, and
requires an enzyme that is stable above 100°C.
To design types of xylanases and other enzymes for industrial conditions, scientists at Verenium Corporation (now
BASF) in San Diego developed a technology of directed evolution. As introduced in Chapter 12, directed evolution “jumpstarts” the evolution process by generating a large number of
possible mutations—in some cases, the entire collection of

single mutations possible in a given gene. Large-scale screening then “selects” for the mutant strains that have optimal
activity. While directed evolution may involve more than one
round of mutation and screening, it avoids the need for hundreds or thousands of rounds of growth and selection.
To generate a hyperthermophilic xylanase, Verenium scientists first undertook “discovery,” a process of collecting and
testing genes encoding xylanase from many naturally occurring bacteria and fungi from all over the world. The most
promising xylanase producers were collected from an alkaline hot spring of the Russian Kamchatka Peninsula, including
bacteria such as Bacillus species and fungi such as Trichoderma. The scientists identified 200 different xylanases
having promising levels of activity and stability. Both bacterial and fungal xylanases showed homology—members of a
group called “family 11,” which shares a common ancestor and
related peptide structure.
From the hot-spring collection, several genes were
selected that encoded the best thermophilic xylanases active
at high pH. The top genes were used for “gene assembly,” in
which parental genes are recombined to form a highly diverse
set of daughter genes (Fig. 1). In effect,
the gene assembly process jump-starts

ates all possible mutant combinations.

CHAPTER 17

The GSSM method also imitates nature, but it yields in one
“generation” a pool of all possible single-codon mutations
that, in nature, might occur, but only over many generations.
For GSSM, the evolved thermophilic xylanase gene was copied
by PCR using primers with 64-fold degeneracy—that is, short
DNA sequences that replace each codon in the gene sequence
with all 64 possible codons (Fig. 1B). For example, in a gene of
300 codons, making all the codon substitutions with 20 different amino acids at each position results in 300 × 20 = 6,000
different single-substitution mutations. The mutant genes
were cloned in an expression vector and transformed into
bacteria. To ensure that greater than 95% of the library was
sampled, 70,000 different colonies were screened for xylanase activity and thermostability. Clones were selected that
increased enzyme stability at 76°C from 10% to 50%.
The thermostable mutant genes were then assembled
and combined by a multisite combinatorial assembly process
that generates all possible combinations of the single-codon
substitutions. Figure 2 shows a distribution of the number
of combined mutations in combinatorial library isolates with
enzyme activity at temperatures as high as 86°C. The combinatorial process ultimately yielded an enzyme (Fig. 3) that is
active at even higher temperatures, up to 101°C. A compelling
result is that none of the mutations found would have been
predicted from crystal structure to increase thermostability;
they arose only from the screen of all possible mutants and, in
combination, yield dramatic enhancement.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

thus, most bacterial and archaeal species have access to
their core genome plus an uncountable number of possible
accessory genes.

Classification and Nomenclature

Defining a species is part of the task of taxonomy, the classifying of life-forms into different categories with shared
traits. Taxonomy is critical for every microbiological pursuit, from diagnosing a patient’s illness to understanding
microbial ecosystems.
Classification generates a hierarchy of taxa (groups
of related organisms; singular, taxon) based on successively narrow criteria. The fundamental basis of modern taxonomy is DNA sequence similarity, but the use
of DNA arises within a long historical tradition of phenotypic description that shapes the views and practice of
microbial taxonomy. Historically, taxa have been defined
and named on the basis of a combination of genetic and
phenotypic traits. The nomenclature of microbes remains
surprisingly fluid: As new traits are identified and the
genetic sequence of a microbe is established, species are all
too frequently renamed. Current information on microbial names is available through online databases such as
the List of Prokaryotic Names with Standing in Nomenclature (LPSN).
Traditional classification designates levels of taxonomic
hierarchy, or rank, such as phylum, class, order, and family (Table 17.3). Some levels of rank are designated by certain suffixes—for example, “-ales” (order) and “-aceae”
(family). The ultimate designation of a type of organism
is that of species, which includes the capitalized name of
the genus (group of closely related species) followed by the

uncapitalized species name—for example, the well-known
species Streptomyces coelicolor. S. coelicolor is a member of
the Actinomycetales (informally called actinomycetes), filamentous Gram-positive bacteria that produce many kinds
of antibiotics. Actinomycetes are subdivided into families
and genera, such as the genus Streptomyces.
Microbiologists continually reveal previously unknown
taxa. In 2002 a group of uncultured marine bacteria, the
SAR11 cluster, was found to comprise a quarter of all
marine microbial cells. SAR11 was originally defined by
its SSU rRNA sequence. Surprisingly, the rRNA sequence
phylogeny places these marine oligotrophs in the order
Rickettsiales, most of whose known members are obligate intracellular parasites, such as Rickettsia, the cause of
Rocky Mountain spotted fever—and also the endosymbiont ancestor of our mitochondria. The SAR11 cluster has
since been classified as part of the order Pelagibacterales,
and a few species have been cultured, such as Pelagibacter
ubique (see Table 17.3).

Note:

Taxonomic categories generally have two forms: formal
and informal. The formal term is capitalized, with a latinized suffix:
Actinomycetales, Pseudomonas, Micrococcus. The informal term is
lowercase, in some cases with an anglicized ending; and informal
references to genera are not italicized: actinomycetes, pseudomonads, micrococci.

Emerging Clades: Unclassified
and Uncultured Bacteria

As we discover new microorganisms, how do we decide
what to call them? The term emerging is used to refer
to an organism recently discovered or described, such as

Pelagibacter (Table 17.3). If the new organism causes a
disease, it is called an “emerging pathogen.” An emerging
organism that cannot be cultured may be known only by its
habitat and its small-subunit rRNA sequence. Such organisms require a culture method and a description of essential
cell structure and metabolism before designation as a new
species. “Incompletely described” emerging organisms are
designated as follows:
■

Unclassified/uncultured organism. An unclassified organism, or uncultured organism, is assigned to a
taxonomic rank based on SSU rRNA sequence but has
not yet been grown in pure culture—for example, an
“uncultured actinomycete.”

■

Environmental sample. An environmental sample is
designated by its habitat and assigned a rank based on
SSU rRNA. Examples of environmentally defined actinomycetes in the NCBI database include “oil-degrading
bacterium AOB1” and “glacier bacterium FJS11.”

■

Candidate species. A cultured organism with some
physiological characterization beyond DNA sequence
may be published with a provisional status of candidate
species, designated by the prefatory term “Candidatus.”
For example, “Candidatus Nostocoida limicola” was
published as “a filamentous bacterium from activated
sludge.”

Nongenetic Categories for
Medicine and Ecology

Genetic relatedness is the standard for classifying and naming organisms in all fields of biology. At the same time, several nongenetic systems of categorization serve a practical
purpose in certain fields. These systems include:
■

Phenotypic categories for identification. Categories
such as pigmentation or cell shape (rod or coccus) may
have minor genetic significance but are useful for practical identification of organisms isolated from field or
clinical sources.

■

Ecological categories. In ecology, the niche filled
by an organism may be more important than its phylogeny. For example, cyanobacteria and sequoia trees
both fill the role of photosynthetic producers of biomass. Both are primary producers—a trophic category
of organisms that feed other organisms in the food
web. Ecological categories are discussed further in
Chapter 21.

■

Disease categories. In medical microbiology, microorganisms are categorized according to the type of disease
they cause or the host organ system they inhabit. For
example, Mycoplasma pneumoniae (a cell wall-less bacte-

rium) and influenza virus are both pulmonary pathogens,
whereas Escherichia coli and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron
are both normal members of the gut microbiome. Disease
categories are discussed further in Chapters 25 and 26.

Naming a Species

A commonly accepted set of names for species and higher
taxa is essential for research and communication. The
accepted rules for naming species and taxa have been determined by the International Committee on Systematics of
Prokaryotes (ICSP). The ICSP establishes minimal criteria for designating species, genera, classes, and other taxa
of bacteria and archaea. To establish a new species, a previously unknown form of microbe must be isolated and
grown in pure culture; this cultured organism is known
as an isolate. The isolate’s unique genetic and phenotypic
traits are published, with a proposed species name designated “Candidatus” for candidate species. An example of
a candidate species is “Candidatus Nitrosopumilus maritimus,” a marine archaeon that oxidizes ammonia, first isolated in 2005. The candidate species becomes accepted as
an official species upon publication in the International
Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, the
official journal of record for novel prokaryotic taxa.
Historically, the taxonomic categories and species
descriptions are compiled in Bergey’s Manual of Determinative Bacteriology, a multivolume reference work of prokaryotic taxonomy. Up-to-date taxonomy of bacteria and
archaea, as well as eukaryotes, is maintained in the “Taxonomy” browser of the interactive National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) online database, supported by the U.S. government.
In recent years, the standard practice for accepting and
naming species has been overwhelmed by the number of
new isolates, as well as uncultured microbes, reported in
the literature. Many uncultured microbes are known only
by their SSU rRNA sequences. Increasingly, however,
uncultured organisms have large portions of their genomes
sequenced and assembled using metagenomics (presented
in Chapters 7 and 21). Metagenomics is the sequencing of
multiple genomes in an environmental community. The
community can be sampled from any kind of habitat, such
as the human digestive tract or the Sargasso Sea.

Identification

Once a species has been described and classified, we need a
way to identify future members of the species isolated from
natural environments. Identification requires the recognition of the class of a given microbe isolated in pure culture. Identification poses special difficulties with microbes,

which, by definition, are invisible to the unaided eye. Even
under the electron microscope, thousands of divergent species may possess similar shape and form.
Because the definition of a species is based on its genetic
sequence, the most consistent and straightforward way to
identify an isolate is to sequence part or all of its genome or
to attempt hybridization of its DNA with a labeled sequence
probe (discussed in Section 7.6). In clinical practice, such
DNA-based methods are used increasingly. Nevertheless,
even in the clinical lab—as well as in field and environmental microbiology—it is convenient to narrow down the possibilities using various easily determined traits, such as cell
shape, staining properties, and metabolic reactions. Thus,

practical identification is based on a combination of phylogeny (relatedness based on DNA sequence divergence)
and phenetic, or phenotypic, traits.
A common strategy of practical identification is the
dichotomous key, in which a series of yes/no decisions
successively narrows down the possible categories of species. Figure 17.29 shows an example of a dichotomous key
used to identify filamentous bacteria isolated from a wastewater treatment facility. Filamentous bacteria are important
in wastewater because their entangled filaments interfere
with the settling of bacteria out of the treated water. Note
that in the key shown, most of the traits are phenotypic,
such as cell size and motility. Most of the branch decisions

CHAPTER 17

have two choices, although one juncture (cell motility and
shape) has four. The key identifies some organisms down to
the species level (Sphaerotilus natans), others to the genus
level (Flexibacter), and others only to numbered samples
whose characterization remains incomplete (0914, 021N).

Thought Question

17.9 Using Figure 17.29, how would you identify a straight,

nonsheathed, Gram-negative bacterium that has sulfur granules, is motile, and is 1.0 µm wide? What would happen if you
assigned the bacterium a width of 0.9 µm?

A disadvantage of the dichotomous key is that it requires
a series of steps, each of which takes time. In the clinical setting, time is critical in identifying a potential pathogen and
prescribing appropriate treatment. An alternative means of
identification is the probabilistic indicator. A probabilistic
indicator is a battery of biochemical tests performed simultaneously on an isolated strain. The indicator requires a
predefined database of known bacteria from a well-studied
habitat, such as Gram-negative bacteria from the human
intestinal tract. To build such a database, numerous strains
of each species must be isolated in pure culture and tested
for all the traits in the database. The fraction of isolates
that test positive for each trait, for each species, is noted
in the database as the probability of obtaining a positive
result. The database can be used to identify a specimen isolated from a patient (discussed in Chapter 28). But, like the
dichotomous key, the probabilistic indicator works only
if the isolate coincides with a member of the predefined
database.

To Summarize
■

■

■

■

Microbial species are defined by sequence similarity of vertically transmitted genes such as SSU rRNA
sequences and multiple orthologous genes. The species
definition should be consistent with the ecological niche
or pathogenicity.
A pan-genome includes core genes possessed by all isolates of a species plus accessory genes found in some isolates but not others. A pan-genome may be open (infinite
number of genes) or closed (finite set of available genes).
Taxonomy is the description and organization of lifeforms into classes (taxa). Taxonomy includes classification, nomenclature, and identification.
Classification is traditionally based on a hierarchy of
ranks. Groups of organisms long studied tend to have
many ranks, whereas recent isolates have few.

DNA sequence relatedness defines microbial taxa.
Below genus level, however, the definition of bacterial
species can be problematic.
Emerging taxa are types of organisms recently discovered or described. They may be uncultured, and their
phylogeny may be uncertain.
Practical identification is based on phenotypic and
genetic traits. Methods of identification include the
dichotomous key and the probabilistic test battery. Both
methods assume a predefined set of organisms.

17.6

Symbiosis and the
Origin of Mitochondria
and Chloroplasts

So far, we have largely considered single species in isolation.
In fact, however, all organisms evolve in the presence of
other kinds of species, with whom they share interactions,
both positive and negative. A major engine of evolution is
symbiosis, the intimate association of two unrelated species. The ecology and behavioral adaptations of microbial
symbiosis are discussed in Chapter 21; here we focus on the
role of symbiosis in the evolution of cells.

Evolution of Endosymbiosis

The word “symbiosis” is popularly understood to mean
mutualism, a relationship in which both partners benefit
and may absolutely require each other. Biologists, however,
recognize parasitism, in which one partner is harmed, as a
relationship equally as intimate as mutualism; both mutualism and parasitism are forms of symbiosis. Intimate relationships between species, either negative or positive, lead
to coevolution, the evolution of two species in response
to one another, showing parallel phylogeny. An important
bacterial mutualism is that of nitrogen fixation, in which
rhizobia form intracellular “bacteroids” within legume
plants that cannot fix nitrogen on their own. Both rhizobia
and their plant hosts are highly evolved to respond to each
other chemically and develop the nitrogen-fixing system.
Another remarkable example of coevolution is that of leafcutter ants, which cultivate both fungal and bacterial partners (discussed in eTopic 17.5).
The most intimate kind of symbiosis is endosymbiosis,
in which one partner population grows within the body
of another organism. Endosymbiosis includes communities of microbes within the digestive tracts of animals, such
as the human intestinal microbiome (discussed in Chapters 21 and 23). The internalized endosymbiont can also

FIGURE 17.30 ■ Endosymbiosis. Paramecium bursaria, a ciliate

be intracellular, as in the case of rhizobial bacteroids within
legume tissues. Rhizobia retain the genetic capacity for
independence, growing readily in soil. Other intracellular endosymbionts, however, become wholly dependent on
their host cells. Pathogenic endosymbionts, such as chlamydias, evolve specialized traits enabling their growth at
the expense of the host and evasion of the host immune
system. But endosymbionts also undergo drastic reductive
evolution, evolving ever-deeper interdependence with their
host cells.
A simple example of intracellular endosymbiosis is that
of the alga Chlorella growing within Paramecium bursaria
(Fig. 17.30). The algae conduct photosynthesis and provide nutrients to the paramecium, which in turn shelters
the algae from predators and viruses. The relationship is
highly specific—only certain species of algae and paramecia participate—and the algal growth is limited to a population that avoids harming the host. This relationship may
give clues to how the bacterial ancestor of chloroplasts
began its intracellular existence.
Despite this intimate relationship, Chlorella retains its
ability to multiply outside the paramecium; thus this symbiosis is reversible. Moreover, under conditions of starvation in the absence of light, the paramecium may start
to digest its endosymbionts as prey. Thus, the nature of
the symbiosis (mutualistic or predatory) depends on the
environment.
Many invertebrate animals, often themselves parasites
of animals or plants, possess obligate bacterial endosymbionts. For example, the fruit fly, Drosophila, carries a
parasitic endosymbiont, the bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. The Wolbachia strains that infect Drosophila cells are
transmitted only through egg cells; they cannot exist outside the insect. Other invertebrate endosymbionts, however, are mutualists. In fact, 15% of insect species depend
on intracellular bacteria to produce essential nutrients, such

as certain amino acids or vitamins. In these mutualisms,
both partners have lost essential traits by reductive evolution, and each now requires the partner species to provide
the lost function.
A surprising number of human invertebrate parasites,
such as filarial nematodes and Anopheles mosquitoes, carry
bacterial endosymbionts required for host growth. This
discovery has exciting implications for treatment of parasitic diseases. Invertebrate parasites such as filarial nematode worms invade human lymph nodes, causing forms
of disease (filariasis) that are notoriously difficult to treat.
Few anti-nematode compounds are sufficiently selective for
worm metabolism versus human metabolism, since both
are eukaryotic animals. A form of filariasis is elephantiasis, in which a limb expands with edema because the lymph
ducts are blocked by worms (Fig. 17.31). Filariasis afflicts
more than 120 million people worldwide, largely in the
Indian subcontinent and in Africa.
A filarial nematode, Brugia malayi, harbors endosymbiotic Wolbachia (a different strain from the one that infects
Drosophila) (Fig. 17.32). Wolbachia may have entered the
nematode originally as a pathogen or parasite, and then
persisted because of its metabolic contributions to the
host. The nematode’s Wolbachia are mutualists; the nematode needs them for embryonic development. The bacteria are found within tissue layers beneath the nematodes’
cuticle and within the uterine tubes of females, where they
enter the developing offspring (Fig. 17.32). When human
patients infected by the nematodes are treated with antibiotics such as tetracycline, the bacteria disappear from worm
tissues. The worm burden gradually decreases, and no offspring are produced. Antibacterial antibiotics eliminate the
worms sooner and more completely than does treatment
with anti-nematode agents.

pathways to make purines, pyrimidines, and the coenzymes riboflavin and FAD—essential pathways lost by its
host nematode. Overall, Wolbachia appears to be evolving
into an organelle of its host, like the ancestors of mitochondria and chloroplasts.

Mitochondria and Chloroplasts

As Lynn Margulis and colleagues showed, the assimilation
of endosymbionts as mitochondria and chloroplasts played
a central role in the evolution of eukaryotes (Fig. 17.33).
Many similar endosymbioses are known today, such as the
free-living algae Chlorella acquired by the protist predator Paramecium bursaria (see Fig. 17.30). Like Wolbachia, mitochondria evolved from a bacterium related to
the rickettsias (intracellular pathogens). The mitochondrial
ancestor must have entered the eukaryotic lineage as, or
shortly after, the eukaryotes diverged from archaea, since
all known eukaryotes retain mitochondria or vestigial remnants of mitochondrial genomes (discussed in Chapter 20).
Mitochondria provide the cell with the essential functions
of electron transport and respiration. The electron transport system (ETS) is found in the mitochondrial inner

membrane, believed to derive from the cell membrane of
the ancestral bacterium. The outer membrane may derive
from the invaginating membrane of the host cell that originally engulfed the endosymbiont.
Chloroplasts arose from cyanobacteria at some point
before the divergence of red and green algae (discussed
in Chapter 20). A model for cyanobacterial uptake can be
seen in the protist Glaucocystophyta, whose cyanobacterial endosymbionts retain cell walls and some metabolism.
Like mitochondria, chloroplasts possess inner and outer
membranes, believed to derive from the ancestral endosymbiont and host, respectively. Photosynthetic complexes
are located in the thylakoid membranes, similar to those of
modern cyanobacteria.
The genomes of mitochondria and chloroplasts both
show extreme reduction (Fig. 17.34)—even more
extreme than that of any known endosymbiotic bacteria. The few genes that remain in the organellar genome
include remnants of the central transcription-translation
apparatus, such as rRNA and tRNAs, as well as a handful of genes whose products are essential for survival of the
host cell: for respiration (mitochondria) or photosynthesis
(chloroplasts).
Mitochondrial genome. In human mitochondria, the mitochondrial genome encodes key parts of the respiratory

chain, including subunits of NADH dehydrogenase,
cytochrome oxidase, and ATP synthase (Fig. 17.34A).
Mutations in these key genes lead to serious diseases; for
example, damage to mitochondrial genes of respiration is
associated with motor neuron disease, parkinsonism, and
forms of ataxia.
But thousands of genes encoding ETS subunits, as well
as other essential parts of mitochondria, have migrated
from the mitochondrion to the nucleus. The nuclear
acquisition probably occurred through accidental copying
of mitochondrial genes into the nuclear genome. Reductive evolution then occurred, faster in the mitochondrial
copy because of the faster mutation rate. Some of these
nuclear-acquired mitochondrial genes show tissue-specific
expression, resulting in different mitochondrial types
associated with different tissues. Thus, some mitochondrial defects are actually inherited through the nuclear
genome. The mitochondria have evolved as integral parts
of the host cell.
Chloroplast genome. In chloroplasts, the organellar genome
encodes essential products for photosynthesis, including
photosystems I and II and the ATP synthase. The chloroplast genome shown in Figure 17.34B retains the large
subunit of Rubisco, whereas the gene encoding the small
subunit has migrated to the nucleus.

CHAPTER 17

Remarkably, the process of symbiogenesis, the generation of new symbiotic associations, continues in many
protists. Protist-algae, also known as “secondary symbiont” algae, result from symbiogenesis in which an alga
(containing a chloroplast) was engulfed by an ancestral
protist. The protist cell contains the degenerate remains
of the algal endosymbiont (Fig. 17.35). The algal mitochondrion was lost through reductive evolution, and the
nucleus shrank to a nucleomorph, the vestigial remains
of a nucleus containing a small amount of the chromosomal DNA of the original algal nucleus. But the algal
chloroplast was maintained, “enslaved” by its new host.
The result is a new protist-alga species, Guillardia theta,
capable of both phototrophy and heterotrophy. Its chloroplast has a double membrane derived from the original
cyanobacterial ancestor of the chloroplast and from the
algal ancestor, surrounded by another double membrane
derived from the cell membranes of the alga and a secondary host.
Other secondary endosymbiont algae, such as kelps, diatoms, and dinoflagellates, are discussed in Chapter 20. In
some species, tertiary symbiosis has been documented, in
which a secondary-endosymbiont alga has been swallowed
in turn by another protist.

Symbiosis is the intimate association of two unrelated species. A symbiosis in which both partners benefit is called mutualism. If one partner benefits while
harming the other, the symbiosis is called parasitism.
Symbiotic partners undergo coevolution, the evolution of two species in response to one another. Coevolution involves reductive (degenerative) evolution, in
which each partner species loses some functions that the
other partner provides.
An endosymbiont lives inside a much larger host
species. Many microbial cells harbor endosymbiotic
bacteria whose metabolism yields energy for their hosts.
Many invertebrates harbor endosymbiotic bacteria.
The bacteria are required for host survival and, in some
cases, for pathology caused by a parasitic invertebrate.
Mitochondria evolved from endosymbionts. The
ancestor of mitochondria was an alphaproteobacterium
related to rickettsias.
Chloroplasts evolved from endosymbionts. The chloroplast ancestor was a cyanobacterium.

18.1 Bacterial Diversity at a Glance

What different kinds of bacteria do
you find associated with colorectal
tumors?

We find that the biofilms that are
associated with sporadic colon cancer are composed of a diverse array of
bacteria. One set of biofilm tumors is
associated predominantly with Bacteroidetes and Lachnospiraceae; a second subset has at least 25% of the sequences mapping to
Fusobacterium species; and a third subset, so far seen in
only one tumor, was dominated by Proteobacteria.
What surprised you most about the bacterial biofilms
found with tumors?
The big surprise was the geographic localization of biofilm-positive tumors to the right colon. As the work was
being done, we noted some tumors were biofilm-positive,
some not so. The day we decided to plot them on a cartoon
of the colon based on the location of the tumor is the day
the pattern revealed itself. As yet, we have not fully unraveled why this dramatic, nearly categorical difference exists
for biofilm formation between right-colon and left-colon
cancers.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

Bacteria evolve a bewildering array of life-forms that colonize every habitat on Earth, from the ocean depths to our
own skin and digestive tract. You might think that, by now,
we would know at least all the major phyla of bacteria, just
as we know the major kinds of vertebrate animals and vascular plants. Yet we are constantly discovering new clades
of bacteria never seen before. At the Johns Hopkins School
of Medicine, Cynthia Sears discovers new bacteria that colonize our colonic epithelium (see the Current Research
Highlight). In Chapter 13 we learned that many colonic
bacteria are normal residents that aid our digestion. But
other bacteria, including members of the Lachnospiraceae,
Bacteroidetes, and Fusobacteria, act as pathogens. Some
take advantage of cancer pathology to invade the tissue of
colon tumors.
Elsewhere, microbe hunters discover bacteria in remote,
pristine sites such as the frozen brine of Antarctic Lake
Vida (Fig. 18.1). The deepest hypersaline layer of Lake
Vida remains trapped without light or oxygen, at –13°C.
From this deep anoxic layer, Alison Murray and colleagues
from the Desert Research Institute recovered growing bacteria that are ultrasmall—some less than 200 nm in diameter. We now predict that all water and soil habitats, as well
as parts of the human body, might also host ultrasmall
microbes, perhaps showing yet other unique traits to be
discovered.
How do we begin to describe bacterial diversity, when
even in familiar habitats the vast majority of species remain
unknown? Chapter 18 surveys the bacteria that we do
know something about. For instance, many kinds of Gramnegative Proteobacteria inhabit our digestive tract, or
grow in ponds by photosynthesis, or colonize legumes as

nitrogen-fixing mutualists. Well-known bacteria are generally those cultured in the laboratory, subject to experiments
under controlled conditions. At the same time, comparing
genome sequences clarifies the relatedness of major groups
of bacteria.
Chapter 18 emphasizes major taxa that are of physiological, ecological, and medical importance. We organize
our discussion by phylogeny (evolutionary relatedness of
taxa), as well as key traits of a taxon, such as the Grampositive cell wall of Firmicutes and the oxygenic photosynthesis of cyanobacteria. We show how diverse bacteria
contribute to communities. Microbial communities and
ecology are explored further in Chapter 21, and their
roles in global biogeochemical cycles are discussed in
Chapter 22.
For each major taxonomic group, we describe a few key
species to represent the spectrum of diversity. Additional
genera and species are referenced in an expanded table
found in Appendix 2 and eAppendix 4.

To survey bacterial diversity in one chapter is like touring all the countries of a continent in a single day. Like
countries, bacterial taxa have complex traits and histories, and often contested borders. But overall, bacteria
share major traits in common. We review these common traits of bacteria and then go on to explore their
differences.

Bacteria: Common Traits
and Diverging Phylogeny

Chapter 17 summarized the differences and similarities of
the three major domains—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya
(see Table 17.2). A common feature of bacteria is their central apparatus for gene expression, particularly their RNA
polymerases, ribosomal RNAs, and translation factors.
Bacterial gene expression complexes differ more from those
of Archaea or Eukarya than the complexes of Archaea or
Eukarya differ from each other. This subtle point of molecular biology has a profound consequence for human medicine and agriculture: It underlies the selective activity of
many antibiotics, such as streptomycin, that attack only
bacteria, without affecting animals or plants.
Another trait distinguishing bacteria from archaea and
eukaryotes is that most bacterial cells possess a cell wall
of peptidoglycan (discussed in Chapter 3). Peptidoglycan
is composed of disaccharide-peptide chains that can crosslink in three dimensions; key enzymes that build the peptide links are blocked by antibiotics such as penicillin and

■

vancomycin. Some archaea possess analogous sugar-peptide structures called “pseudopeptidoglycan” (discussed
in Chapter 19), but their structural details and antibiotic
sensitivity differ fundamentally from those of bacterial peptidoglycan. Eukaryotes such as fungi and plants have cell
walls of polysaccharides such as cellulose and chitin (discussed in Chapter 20).
In bacteria, variant forms of peptidoglycan distinguish
different species. For instance, the Gram-positive pathogen
Staphylococcus aureus has cell wall peptides cross-linked by
pentaglycine (a chain of five glycine residues). Some species, such as mycoplasmas, lack peptidoglycan altogether,
although they arose by reductive evolution from bacteria
that possess it.
The phylogeny of known bacteria is presented in Figure 18.2. The names of well-studied phyla are lettered in
blue. A phylum (plural, phyla) is defined as a group of
organisms sharing a common ancestor that diverged early
from other bacteria, based on small-subunit rRNA (SSU

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

whole-genome data reveal new kinds of bacteria faster
than we can figure out how to culture or characterize
them. We continually discover very different new kinds
of bacteria, known as emerging clades (see Chapter 17).
Some microbiologists estimate that there exist 1,500
phyla, many as yet undiscovered. Apart from their genome
sequences, we know little about those newly discovered
bacteria. Lineages whose genome sequences diverged
early, at or before the well-known phyla, are called deepbranching taxa. In addition, other environmental DNA
sequences of uncultivated bacteria (not shown) branch
from all parts of this tree.
Phyla and other major divisions are also defined on the
basis of historical convention and consensus of the research
community. Generally, a well-studied bacterial phylum
comprises species that share key traits as well as ancestry.
While sharing key traits, the member species often show
remarkable diversity in other ways. Some phyla, such as
Cyanobacteria, share a unique form of metabolism (oxygenic photosynthesis), yet have evolved many diverse cell
shapes and grow in diverse habitats. Other phyla, such as
Spirochetes, share a unique cell structure while diverging
in habitat and metabolism.
Table 18.1 introduces seven major groups of bacteria that appear most frequently in the literature. An
expanded version of this table, including many
important species, appears in Appendix 2.2 and
eAppendix 4.2.

Well-Studied Bacterial Phyla

Certain groups of bacteria have been studied for a century
or more, and their traits are known in detail. A major group
that serves all ecosystems is the Cyanobacteria (see Section
18.2). Cyanobacteria conduct photosynthesis by splitting
water and releasing oxygen (O2). Some species adapt to use
H 2S when available. Oxygenic photosystems evolved from
ancestral sulfide photosystems (discussed in Chapter 14).
Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts (eukaryotic organelles
that evolved from Cyanobacteria) are the only life-forms
that produce oxygen gas. These bacteria have a unique
two-photosystem apparatus for oxygenic photosynthesis
arranged in lamellar arrays of membranes called thylakoids
(discussed in Chapter 14). Unique to Cyanobacteria and
chloroplasts are the chlorophylls, most notably chlorophylls
a and b; these molecules are distinct from the bacteriochlorophylls used by non-oxygenic bacterial phototrophs.
Cyanobacteria share a common metabolism, yet the cell
shape and organization of cyanobacterial species show an
immense range of different forms, including chains of cells,
square arrays, and globular colonies.
For soil and sediment, major phyla include the Firmicutes and Actinobacteria, which stain Gram-positive

(see Section 18.3). A few Firmicutes (the mycoplasmas) fail
to stain Gram-positive because they lack cell walls, and some
Actinobacteria possess a thick waxy coat that excludes the
Gram stain. Most Firmicutes and Actinobacteria have an
exceptionally thick cell wall, with several layers of peptidoglycan threaded by supporting molecules such as teichoic acids
or mycolic acids. The thick, reinforced cell wall is what retains
the Gram stain (discussed in Chapter 2). In addition, most
Gram-positive species possess a well-developed S-layer of protein with glycan strands. By contrast, in other bacterial phyla
the S-layer is either absent or present in diminished form.
Firmicutes and Actinobacteria differ genetically in their
GC content—that is, the proportion of their genomes consisting of guanine-cytosine base pairs (as opposed to adenine-thymine). Firmicutes (low GC) generally grow as
well-defined rods or cocci, isolated or in simple filaments
consisting of cells that divide but remain attached end to
end. Many Firmicutes form endospores, inert heat-resistant
spores that can remain viable for thousands of years. Endospores are the most durable type of spore formed by bacteria.
Actinobacteria have a relatively high GC content and
are known as the “high-GC Firmicutes.” These bacteria
include the actinomycetes (order Actinomycetales), which
undergo complex life cycles, forming filamentous hyphae
and arthrospores. Other groups closely related to actinomycetes grow as isolated rods and cocci, often with variable
shape, such as the corynebacteria. Actinomycete relatives
include the well-known causative agents of tuberculosis
(Mycobacterium tuberculosis) and leprosy (M. leprae).
Proteobacteria are called “Gram-negative” because
their single layer of peptidoglycan fails to retain the Gram
stain (see Section 18.4). All Proteobacteria have an outer
membrane consisting of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and
porins. All species of Proteobacteria have an LPS outer
membrane, but their cell shape may be rods, cocci, or spiral rods. In contrast to Cyanobacteria, the Proteobacteria
show an immense range of diverse metabolism (heterotrophy, lithotrophy, and anaerobic phototrophy). Most species
are aerobic, facultative, or microaerophilic (requiring a low
level of O2; inhibited at higher levels).
Proteobacteria include five major classes, named Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria,
Deltaproteobacteria, and Epsilonproteobacteria. (Some sources
separate the Greek letter from the name “Proteobacteria”—
for example, “Alpha Proteobacteria,” “Beta Proteobacteria,”
and so on.) Proteobacteria include famous model organisms and pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella
enterica, and Yersinia pestis. Others are human or animal
symbionts, either as mutualists or as pathogens—including
Rickettsia, the genus most closely related to mitochondria.
The Spirochetes (see Section 18.6) have evolved a
unique and complex cellular form of a flexible, extended spiral, resembling an old-style telephone cord. The cytoplasm

and cell membrane are contained within an outer membrane called the sheath. Between the sheath and the cell
membrane extend flagella doubled back from each pole.
The rotation of these flagella is coordinated so as to twist
and flex the helical body, generating motility and chemotaxis. Spirochetes include many free-living forms in aquatic
systems, as well as digestive endosymbionts and pathogens.
Three phyla of bacteria have unusual cell shapes: Chlamydiae, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia (see Section 18.7). Most members of these groups have lost their
peptidoglycan cell walls, but they show complex structural
adaptations and developmental forms. The Chlamydiae
(best-known genus Chlamydia) are intracellular parasites
that lose most of their cell envelope during intracellular
growth. The replicating parasites generate multiple sporelike “elementary bodies” that escape to infect the next host.
Planctomycetes, by contrast, are free-living aquatic bacteria, with stalked cells that reproduce by budding. Each
planctomycete cell contains an extra double membrane surrounding its nucleoid, analogous to a eukaryotic nuclear
membrane, though it evolved independently. Verrucomicrobia, also free-living, are bacteria with wart-like protruding structures containing actin.

Deep-Branching Thermophiles

Deep-branching thermophiles show unusually large
genetic divergence from other bacterial clades. This large
divergence makes the thermophiles appear to have separated earlier from other kinds of bacteria. Other evidence,
however, implicates high mutation rates and gene transfer between distant relatives as the source of genetic divergence of thermophiles.
The deep-branching taxa include extremophiles such as
Aquifex aeolicus (growing at up to 95ºC at marine thermal
vents). These organisms also show rapid growth and high
mutation rates, which may have accelerated their molecular clock. These hyperthermophilic bacteria also share their
high-temperature habitats with Archaea—and show surprising archaeal traits. For example, Aquifex species have
archaeal ether-linked membrane lipids (discussed in Chapters 3 and 19). The genes encoding these “archaeal” lipids
appear to have entered bacteria by horizontal transfer from
archaea to bacteria sharing the high-temperature habitat.
Aquificae and Thermotogae. Most members of the ther-

mophilic phyla Aquificae and Thermotogae are hydrogenotrophs, oxidizing hydrogen gas with molecular oxygen
to make water. Aquifex pyrophilus, a flagellated rod, was
fi rst discovered by extremophile microbiologist Karl
Stetter at the University of Regensburg in a submarine
hydrothermal vent north of Iceland (for an interview, see
eTopic 18.1). Stetter named the bacterium Aquifex, Latin

for “water maker,” because it oxidizes hydrogen to form
water. Aquifex species are obligate autotrophs, fi xing CO2
into biomass using the reverse TCA cycle. Other genera
of the phylum Aquificae oxidize small organic molecules
or sulfides, and form fi lamentous mats in hydrothermal
springs. Thermocrinis ruber grows at 82°C–88°C as a
mat of pink fi lamentous streamers in the outflow channel of Octopus Spring, in Yellowstone National Park. A
related phylum of thermophiles (growing at 50°C–80°C)
is Thermotogae. Thermotoga maritima is a sulfur-reducing respirer, originally isolated from a geothermal vent in
Vulcano, Italy. The cells have a loosely bound sheath, or
“toga,” for which the genus is named.
Both Aquificae and Thermotogae show remarkable
mosaic genomes. Nearly a quarter of the T. maritima
genome derives from archaea. The Aquificae, too, show
large proportions of archaeal DNA sequence and traits,
which are ascribed to the sharing of the high-temperature habitat. But Aquificae also possess large portions of
sequence related to clostridia and to Epsilonproteobacteria (discussed shortly). This degree of mosaicism leads
some researchers to argue that Aquificae cannot be said to
branch from one clade; or if they do, that we can never
know, statistically, which clade that is.
Thought Question

18.1 What taxonomic questions are raised by the apparent

high rate of gene transfer between archaea and thermophilic
bacteria?

Chloroflexi. Chloroflexi bacteria are fi lamentous photo-

heterotrophs, supplementing heterotrophy with photosystem II (PS II) to generate ATP (discussed in Chapter 14).
Together with other thermophiles, Chloroflexi species
form massive microbial mats in the hot springs of Yellowstone (Fig. 18.3). Most species of Chloroflexus contain their
photosynthetic apparatus within membranous organelles
called chlorosomes. The process of photosynthesis by chlorosomes is presented in Chapter 14. Chloroflexi are informally called “green nonsulfur bacteria” to distinguish them
from Chlorobi, a phylum of green phototrophs that are
strict anaerobes (presented shortly, with the deep-branching
Gram-negative phyla). However, Chloroflexus species may
appear red or yellow, owing to accessory pigments.
Deinococcus-Thermus. The phylum Deinococcus-Thermus possesses a unique structural trait: the substitution of
L -ornithine for diaminopimelic acid in the peptidoglycan
cross-bridge. Thermus species (growing at 70°C–75°C) are
heterotrophs commonly isolated from hot tap water. Deinococcus species, however, are not thermophilic. D. radiodurans bacteria resist extremely high doses of ionizing
radiation (discussed in Chapters 5 and 9). A heterotroph,

D. radiodurans was originally isolated from cans of meat

indoors and high in the atmosphere; they resist drought.

Deep-Branching Gram-Negatives

BOB LINDSTROM

Several deep-branching phyla stain Gram-negative but
diverge distantly from the Proteobacteria. They show
diverse metabolism and morphology (see Section 18.5).
Most members of the phyla Bacteroidetes and Chlorobi are obligate anaerobes. Within Bacteroidetes, Bacteroides species ferment complex carbohydrates, serving as
the major mutualists of the human gut. By contrast, the
closely related Chlorobi species are anaerobic “green sulfur” phototrophs that photolyze sulfides or hydrogen. The
Nitrospirae largely resemble proteobacteria in form. Most
oxidize nitrite (NO2 –) to nitrate (NO3 –). Nitrite oxidation
is a lithotrophic conversion essential for ecosystems (see
Chapter 22). Other Gram-negative clades include Acidobacteria, an important phylum of soil bacteria; and the
phylum Fusobacteria, which includes human pathogens.

Emerging Clades

Clades of microbes that are recently defined or characterized
are referred to as emerging. Emerging clades are discovered
by field microbiologists who devise ever-more-creative screens,
finding new bacteria with unexpected traits. For instance,
in 2015 Jill Banfield’s group at UC Berkeley discovered
ultrasmall bacteria from the Rifle, Colorado, aquifer. These
bacteria passed through a 0.2-μm filter—barely big enough
for ribosomes. Cryo-TEM shows tiny cells that contain about
fifty ribosomes, with a cell wall enclosed by an S-layer and
long pili (Fig. 18.4). The cells’ genomes are smaller than
those of most known bacteria. Their DNA sequences show
deeply branching phylogeny—that is, very distant relatedness
to all the bacteria known. Some of their 16S rRNA sequences
are so distant from those of other taxa that they cannot be
amplified by so-called universal bacterial primers for PCR. We
know little about these microbes—or others yet unknown,
which future microbe hunters may discover.

■

Deep-branching thermophiles such as Aquifex and
Thermotoga species share traits and habitats with thermophilic archaea. Their genomes are highly mosaic,
including many archaeal genes. Deinococcus species
are highly resistant to ionizing radiation. Chloroflexus
species are thermophilic photoheterotrophs.
Emerging organisms continually reveal previously
unknown clades of bacteria.

Note:

The main organizing principle used in Chapters 18–20 is
that of phylogeny based on DNA relatedness. Characteristic traits
described for each branch apply to the majority of its known species, though many exceptions have evolved, such as members of
Spirochetes that lack spiral form.

18.2

Cyanobacteria: Oxygenic
Phototrophs

All of the oxygen gas in Earth’s atmosphere comes from Cyanobacteria, and from plant chloroplasts that evolved from an
ancient cyanobacterium. The phylum Cyanobacteria (also
called Cyanophyta) is named for the blue phycocyanin accessory pigments possessed by some genera, giving them a bluish tint. Cyanobacteria commonly appear green because of the
predominant blue and red absorption by chlorophylls a and b
(see Table 18.2). Essentially the same chlorophylls are found in
plant chloroplasts, which evolved from internalized cyanobacteria (discussed in Chapter 17). Some cyanobacteria, however,
appear red because of the accessory pigment phycoerythrin,
which absorbs blue-green light in a range missed by cyanobacterial chlorophylls. Cyanobacteria are the only prokaryotes that use both photosystems I and II, photolyzing water
to produce oxygen, as explained in Chapter 14. Under anoxic
conditions, most cyanobacteria can also photolyze hydrogen,
reduced sulfur compounds, and organic compounds. Use of
H2S allows flexibility in habitats such as wetlands that alternate between aerobic and anoxic conditions.
The success of oxygenic phototrophy is shown by its
fundamental similarity across all members of Cyanobacteria, despite their amazing variety of cell form, behavior,
and genetics. Even two cyanobacterial genera such as Synechococcus and Anabaena share only 37% of their genes.
Cyanobacteria are found in all habitats, from tropical soils
to Antarctica. Some kinds are eaten by humans, such as in
Spirulina salad or Nostoc soup.
How does the oxygenic photosynthesis of cyanobacteria
compare with the non-oxygenic photosynthesis of thermophilic Chloroflexi, or of sulfur-based phototrophs among
the Proteobacteria? Table 18.2 summarizes key features

698

of phototrophy in clades throughout the bacterial domain,
including those presented in this chapter. All light-harvesting complexes descend from one of two ancestral sources:
the chlorophyll/bacteriochlorophyll with electron transport
(PS I, PS II) or the proteorhodopsin proton pump. These
photosystems have diverged through vertical inheritance, as
well as by horizontal transfer between different clades.

Cyanobacterial Cell Structure

The photosynthetic apparatus of cyanobacteria is organized
within thylakoids, pockets of membrane resembling flattened spheres packed with reaction centers. The thylakoids
may be distributed through the cell, as in filamentous genera such as Nostoc (Fig. 18.5A), or they may encircle the
cell in concentric layers, as in the single-celled marine species Prochlorococcus marinus (Fig. 18.5B). Prochlorococcus
is one of the smallest and most abundant oxygen producers in the biosphere, accounting for 40%–50% of all marine

phototrophic biomass. In both large cells and small, the
thylakoids are completely separate from the plasma membrane, unlike the attached chlorosomes of Chloroflexi and
the plasma membrane extensions of “purple” Proteobacteria (see Table 18.2). Cyanobacterial thylakoids resemble
the thylakoids of eukaryotic chloroplasts; they are the most
complex and specialized form of photosynthetic apparatus.
Cyanobacteria have several other subcellular structures
(Fig. 18.5). Carboxysomes (also known as polyhedral
bodies) are rich in the enzyme Rubisco, and they fix CO2
(discussed in Chapter 15). Cyanobacteria store energy-rich
compounds in lipid bodies. To maintain height in the water
column and thus access to sunlight, cyanobacteria have gas
vesicles, whose buoyancy enables cells to float. Their external structures include a thick peptidoglycan cell wall, similar
to that of Gram-positive cells, plus several external layers that
vary with different species. Many species move by “gliding,”
a form of motility whose mechanism is poorly understood.
Besides fixing CO2, most cyanobacteria fix N2. Because
nitrogen fixation requires the absence of oxygen, cyanobacteria have to solve the problem of maintaining anaerobic biochemistry while producing huge quantities of highly toxic
O2. Different species solve this problem in different ways:

■ Cyanobacterial cell structure. A. Intracellular
organelles of Nostoc, a typical filamentous cyanobacterium (colorized TEM). B. Intracellular organelles of Prochlorococcus, a prochlorophyte cyanobacterium, the smallest known phototroph. Prochlorococcus accounts for 40%–50% of marine phototrophic biomass.

Single-celled species include Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, the most abundant phototrophs in the oceans.
Another single-celled cyanobacterium is Microcystis, a
colonial microbe found in freshwater that produces dangerous toxins (microcystins). Blooms of Microcystis form
in the spring and summer when nitrogen and phosphorus
runoff from agricultural fertilizer and animal waste enters
lakes and rivers. A Microcystis bloom in Lake Erie in 2014
resulted in microcystin levels great enough that the water
supply of Toledo was contaminated. Since cyanobacterial
species can have positive or negative impacts on their habitat, environmental scientists survey the cyanobacterial communities of lakes and ponds in order to assess their health.

From these samples, she will sequence DNA to identify the

Other cyanobacterial genera, such as Oscillatoria and
Nostoc, form multicellular filaments. Such filaments may
contain hundreds or even thousands of cells (Fig. 18.6A and
B). Oscillatoria cells are stacked like plates, wider than they
are long. To disseminate their cells beyond the biofilm, the
filaments produce hormogonia (singular, hormogonium),

short motile chains of three to five cells. Many filamentous
species, such as Nostoc, develop heterocysts to fix nitrogen
(Fig. 18.6A) (discussed in Chapter 15).
Under environmental stress, such as light limitation or
phosphate starvation, filamentous cyanobacteria such as
Anabaena form specialized spore cells called akinetes. An
akinete forms as a long, oval cell adjacent to a heterocyst,
where it stores nitrogen and develops a thickened envelope. Like other types of spores, akinetes resist desiccation
and remain viable for long periods. Table 18.3 compares

Firmicutes and
Actinobacteria
(Gram-Positive)

Which bacteria have the toughest, thickest cell walls? Most
bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes, meaning “tough skin”
bacteria, have thick peptidoglycan cell walls that retain the
Gram stain (discussed in Chapter 3). The thick cell wall
helps exclude antibiotics and antibacterial agents from
competitors in the environment. Members of a related phylum, Actinobacteria, also stain Gram-positive. As shown in
Table 18.1, we define Firmicutes as the phylum of Grampositive bacteria that contains “low-GC” species (having
a low ratio of GC/AT base pairs), whereas Actinobacteria are the “high-GC” species. Species in both phyla have
thick cell walls reinforced by teichoic acids, cross-threading
phosphodiester chains of glycerol and ribitol (discussed in
Chapter 3).

Endospore

Many firmicutes, such as Bacillus and Clostridium species, survive unfavorable environmental conditions by
forming durable endospores. Non–spore formers such as
Lactobacillus and Streptococcus may have evolved from a
common Firmicutes ancestor that formed endospores. In
many cases, the machinery to form endospores is discovered in the genomes of firmicutes previously thought to be
non–spore formers, such as Carboxydothermus, soil bacteria
that oxidize CO (carbon monoxide) to CO2. On the other
hand, actinobacteria of the order Actinomycetales (actinomycetes), such as Streptomyces, do not form endospores,
but they develop filaments that disperse arthrospores (see
Table 18.3).

Firmicutes Include EndosporeForming Rods

Endospore-forming bacteria are common in soil and air
because their spore forms resist desiccation and can remain
viable in a dormant state for thousands of years. The bestknown orders are Bacillales (mainly aerobic respirers) and
Clostridiales (obligate anaerobes). Both groups include species of environmental and economic importance, as well as
causative agents of well-known diseases.

food by suspending a sample in water and heating at 80°C
for half an hour. Vegetative cells (that is, cells undergoing binary fission) and non–spore formers are killed at that
temperature. The remaining endospores will germinate
and grow on a beef broth agar plate at 25°C–30°C. Bacillus

wrinkles in skin (Fig. 18.12B) (discussed in Chapter 26).
Other species, such as C. acetobutylicum, have economic
importance as producers of industrial solvents such as butanol and acetone (for industrial microbiology, see Chapter 16). The butanol pathway is an example of the diverse
fermentative strategies found among clostridia. Unlike
Bacillus (a monophyletic clade with a common ancestor),
the Clostridium group is polyphyletic, representing many
clades that branch among different genera.
The best-known Clostridium species, such as C. botulinum and C. tetani, sporulate in a form distinct from that
of Bacillus (see Fig. 18.12A). The growing Clostridium
endospore swells the end of the cell, forming a “drumstick”
appearance. Mature clostridial spores are generally less heat
resistant than the spores of Bacillus and thus more difficult to isolate in pure culture from natural environments.
Nevertheless, Clostridium spores are found in soil and
water, ready to germinate and grow when the environment
becomes anoxic. Many harmless species are found in the
human colon, particularly in infants. Pathogenic C. botulinum can grow within the colon of very young infants, and
infant botulism has been implicated in some cases of sudden infant death syndrome.
Another species, Clostridium difficile, is a life-threatening intestinal pathogen, resistant to most antibiotics.
C. difficile grows in patients treated with antibiotics that
eliminate normal enteric bacteria, allowing growth of the

pathogen. The pathogen can be so hard to eradicate that
patients require fecal bacteriotherapy, or “fecal transplant”
from a healthy person’s colon. The healthy colon residents
recolonize the gut and outcompete the pathogen.
Related to Clostridium are the Heliobacteriaceae, or “Sun
bacteria,” the only known phototrophs in Firmicutes (see
Table 18.2). Their name derives from their yellowish color,
caused by the shift of their red-peak absorbance into the
infrared, which allows transmission of red light plus green
light (perceived as yellow). The heliobacteria are photoheterotrophs, with a PS I reaction center providing a modest boost
of energy to supplement heterotrophic metabolism of simple
organic compounds. Most heliobacterial cells are elongated
rods with peritrichous flagella, and they form endospores—
the only known endospore-forming phototrophs.

digestive tract of guinea pigs (Fig. 18.13B). Endospores
ingested from feces germinate in the upper intestine but
rarely undergo binary fission. Instead, the growing cell
forms forespores at both poles (Fig. 18.13C). The forespores actually multiply within the mother cell to form
several endospores, which are released in the colon before
defecation.
An even larger enteric endosymbiont is Epulopiscium
fishelsoni, found in the digestive tract of surgeonfish
(Fig. 18.14). These bacteria are large enough to be seen
by eye—about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. As in M. polyspora, Angert showed that E. fishelsoni
reproduction is synchronized with the digestive cycle of its
host, but it has gone even further in transformation of the
sporulation cycle. Binary fission is eliminated; the cell must
fission at both poles. Each polar fission generates an intracellular daughter cell that grows to nearly the full length of
the mother cell. From two to seven intracellular offspring
ultimately emerge in “live birth” from the mother cell,
which then disintegrates.
An even more bizarre “live birth” species related to clostridia was discovered in the mammalian intestine. These
bacteria, provisionally named “Candidatus Savagella,”
grow as filaments attached to the intestinal epithelial cells
(Special Topic 18.1).

Non-Spore-Forming Firmicutes

Many Firmicute species do not form spores. These non–
spore formers include species of Bacillales and Clostridiales,
as well as other Gram-positive orders such as Lactobacillales. In these taxa, the endospore-forming system was
probably lost by reductive evolution. Non-spore-forming
firmicutes include human pathogens such as Listeria and
Streptococcus species, as well as lactic acid bacteria that are
important for food production.

Listeria species are facultative anaerobic bacilli, named
for the British surgeon Joseph Lister (1827–1912), who
was the first to promote antisepsis during surgery. They
include enteric pathogens, such as L. monocytogenes, that
contaminate cheese and sauerkraut (discussed in Chapter 16). Unlike other food-associated organisms, Listeria
grows at temperatures as low as 4°C. Under preindustrial
conditions of food preparation, L. monocytogenes was generally outcompeted by other flora. The era of refrigeration
led to the emergence of Listeria as the cause of listeriosis, a
severe gastrointestinal illness that can progress to the nervous system. L. monocytogenes cells are taken up by macrophages into phagocytic vesicles, but they avoid digestion
and escape the vesicles. The bacteria then multiply as they
travel through the host cytoplasm, generating “tails” of
actin (Fig. 18.15
). The actin tails eventually project
the cells of Listeria out of the original host cell and enable
it to penetrate a neighboring host cell.
Lactic acid bacteria. The lactic acid bacteria (order Lacto-

bacillales) are aerotolerant (capable of growth in the presence of oxygen), though they do not use oxygen to respire.
Most lactic acid bacteria are obligate fermenters; that is,
they generate ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation (discussed in Chapter 13). They ferment primarily by converting sugars to lactic acid (a fermentation pathway discussed
in Chapter 13). As the acid builds up, the pH decreases
until it halts bacterial growth; thus, the carbon source
retains much of its food value for human consumption.
This is the basis of yogurt and cheese production. Lactococcus and Lactobacillus species are extremely important
for the dairy industry (discussed in Chapter 16). Other
common genera of lactic acid bacteria include Leuconostoc,
which often spoils meat, and Pediococcus, found in sauerkraut and fermented bean products, as well as meat products such as sausage.

of flexible wall-less cells that maintain a shape through
some kind of cytoskeleton (Fig. 18.18A and B). On agar
they form colonies of a characteristic “fried-egg” appearance (Fig. 18.18C).
The best-known genus of Mollicutes is Mycoplasma,
although its species now appear to fall in several distantly
related branches. Mycoplasmas are found as parasites of
every known class of multicellular organism, including vertebrates, insects, and vascular plants; in humans,
they cause pneumonia and meningitis. Another medically important mycoplasma is Ureaplasma urealyticum,
an opportunistic pathogen inhabiting the genital tracts
of men and women. Most individuals are unaware they
harbor the organism, but U. urealyticum has been associated with urethritis, amniotic infections, and pulmonary
infections.
Some Mycoplasma species remain adherent to the host
cell, whereas others penetrate and grow intracellularly.
Most mycoplasma cells have a rounded cell shape with

Mycoplasmas lack a cell wall. The mycoplasmas are cell

one or two extended tips. In M. penetrans, an opportunistic pathogen infecting AIDS patients, the cell’s
attachment tip is coated with adhesion molecules that
enable attachment to a host cell surface (Fig. 18.18A).
The attachment tip penetrates deep into epithelial tissues. By contrast, the fish pathogen M. mobile has no
attachment tip, but glides along a surface at a rate of
seven cell lengths per second (Fig. 18.18B). The basis
of mycoplasma motility is not understood, although it
may involve gliding or cytoskeletal contraction. In some
species, motility involves a specialized cell tip called the
“terminal organelle,” but species that lack this organelle
are equally motile. Species of Spiroplasma have a spiral

shape and undergo corkscrew motion; the basis for this
motion is also unknown.
Mycoplasma genomes are among the smallest in known
cellular organisms. They also lack biosynthetic pathways
for amino acids and phospholipids, which instead must be
acquired from the host. Mycoplasmas have unique nutritional requirements, such as cholesterol, a membrane component typical of eukaryotes but rare for prokaryotes. For
these reasons, mycoplasmas are difficult to grow in pure
culture, although they readily infect tissue cultures. In
fact, mycoplasma contamination of tissue culture is so
prevalent that it has compromised major studies of cancer
and AIDS.

Actinomycetes Form
Multicellular Filaments

The phylum Actinobacteria, the “high-GC Gram-positives,” comprises several orders, including Actinomycetales
and Bifidobacteriales. Members of the order Actinomycetales are “actinomycetes.” Actinomycetes include filamentous spore formers such as Streptomyces and Frankia,
as well as short-chain organisms such as Mycobacterium,
and irregularly shaped cells such as Corynebacterium.
Members of an emerging group of marine actinomycetes,
such as Salinispora, are isolated from sediment and from
sponges. Salinispora species form numerous exotic secondary products that show promise as pharmaceutical
agents.
The actinomycetes form complex multicellular filaments superficially resembling the branched “fuzzy”
form of fungi (fungi are discussed in Chapter 20). Profoundly important for medicine, actinomycetes and fungi
produce most of our antibiotics. Researchers mine the
soil of remote environments to find actinomycetes producing antibiotics for which resistance genes are not yet
widespread.
Streptomyces: filamentous spore formers. The best-

studied actinomycetes are Streptomyces bacteria, which
form multicellular fi laments that generate dispersible spores. Streptomycetes play a major role in the ecosystems of soil (discussed in Chapter 21). Decaying

Streptomyces cells produce the compound geosmin, which
causes the characteristic odor of soil and can affect the
taste of drinking water. In culture, the best-known species, S. coelicolor (Latin, “sky color”), forms strikingly blue
colonies (Fig. 18.19A). The blue color derives from several pigments, including actinorhodin, a polyketide antibiotic. Other species produce fi laments that are red, orange,
green, or gray, depending on their distinctive products,
many of which are antibiotics.
Thought Question

18.6 Why would Streptomyces produce antibiotics targeting
other bacteria?

Streptomyces species are obligate aerobes, requiring
access to air to complete their multicellular life cycle (see
earlier, Fig. 18.8C). When a Streptomyces spore germinates, it extends vegetative mycelia, branched filaments
that grow into the substrate. Some of the filaments then
grow upward into the air, where they develop into aerial mycelia. The aerial mycelia in some species grow in
tightly coiled spirals (Fig. 18.19B and C). As the mycelial colony runs out of nutrients, older cells of the filament age and lyse, releasing nutrients that are absorbed
by the younger cells. The nutrients also attract other
scavengers, which may be killed by antibiotics produced

by the aging streptomycete cells. The dead scavengers,
too, release nutrients that feed the growing tip of the
mycelium.
As mycelia mature, they fragment into smaller cells
called exospores (also called arthrospores). Exospores are
vegetative cells, not dormant like Bacillus endospores (see
Table 18.3). The exospores separate and are dispersed
by the wind, enabling them to colonize a new location.
Streptomycete mycelia can be obtained from natural habitats by burying a glass slide in soil and then waiting several days for spores to germinate, covering the slide with
mycelia. They are challenging to isolate in pure culture,
however, because their coiled filaments trap cells of other
bacteria.
The S. coelicolor genome contains over 8 million base
pairs—one of the largest prokaryotic genomes. Streptomycete chromosomes are linear with special “telomeres,”
single-stranded end sequences that double back to form
hairpin loops (Fig. 18.19D). Much of the lengthy genome
of a streptomycete encodes catabolism of a rich array of
diverse organic components of decaying plant and animal
matter, including even lignin. Other genes encode extensive operons for production of diverse secondary products
(see Chapter 15), including antibiotics. More than half
of the antibiotics currently used in medicine derive from
Streptomyces species.

Note: Distinguish Streptomyces, filamentous rod-shaped actinomycetes, from nonactinomycete Streptococcus, Gram-positive
cocci that form short, unbranched chains.
Actinomycetes associated with animals and plants. Many

marine actinomycetes associate with sponges, where
they produce antibiotics that may help the sponge resist
pathogens. Pharmaceutical companies now investigate
these sponge symbionts for new drugs. Some Streptomyces species maintain a mutualism with leaf-cutter ants.
The ants culture the bacteria on special organs to produce antibiotics against parasites of their fungal gardens
(discussed in eTopic 17.5). A few actinomycetes are animal pathogens; for example, Actinomyces species cause
actinomycosis, a form of skin abscesses in humans and
cattle.
Actinomycetes have many mutually beneficial associations with plants. For example, Frankia associates with
the alder tree, which develops orange-yellow-colored
nodules on its roots to fix nitrogen (Fig. 18.20). Frankia species live as endophytes, endosymbionts of vascular
plants. This nitrogen fixation mutualism is analogous to
the better-known symbiosis between legumes and rhizobia (discussed along with Alphaproteobacteria, in Section
18.4). Other Frankia species benefit wheat by conferring

resistance to major fungal pathogens, such as the fungus
that causes “take-all” disease, as well as to certain parasites and insects. Still other Frankia species grow as saprophytes, consuming dead leaf litter. A few actinomycetes
cause plant diseases. For example, potato scab disease is
caused by Streptomyces scabies.
Nonmycelial Actinobacteria: Mycobacterium and Corynebacterium. These actinobacteria share the thick acid-

fast cell wall of Streptomyces but lack the mycelial lifestyle.
Two genera that cause dreaded diseases are Mycobacterium (Fig. 18.21) and Corynebacterium. Both genera
have thick cell envelopes containing mycolic acids and
phenolic glycolipids. The mycolic acids of M. tuberculosis
are extremely diverse and include some of the longestchain acids known, up to 90 carbons (Fig. 18.21C). The
mycolic acids are linked to arabinogalactan, a polymer
of arabinose and galactose built on the peptidoglycan
(discussed in Chapter 3). The mycolyl-arabinogalactanpeptidoglycan complex forms a waxy coat that impedes
the entry of nutrients through porins and thus limits
growth rate, but it also protects the bacterium from host
defenses and antibiotics. For this reason, to cure tuberculosis requires an exceptionally long course of antibiotic
therapy.
Mycobacterium includes the species M. tuberculosis
and M. leprae, as well as lesser-known pathogens such as
M. ulcerans. Cells of M. tuberculosis can be detected by the
acid-fast stain as tiny rods associated with sloughed cells
in sputum (Fig. 18.21A). In the acid-fast stain, cells are
penetrated with a dye that is retained under treatment with
acid alcohol (discussed in Chapter 2). The acid-fast property
is associated with unusual cell wall lipids, such as mycolic
acids. M. tuberculosis bacteria are challenging to culture;
they form crinkled colonies after 2 weeks of growth on
agar-based media (Fig. 18.21B).

The closely related species M. leprae causes the disfiguring
disease leprosy (Fig. 18.22A). The species has one of the longest known doubling times of any pathogen (about 14 days),
and it can take a year to grow enough cells in the laboratory
for observation. Growth of M. leprae requires lower temperature; for this reason, leprosy attacks the extremities (hands
and feet) whose temperature is lower than that of the body
core. Culture on artificial media is impossible; the bacteria
can be grown only within low-temperature animals, such as
armadillos, or within genetically immunodeficient mice.
The genomes have been sequenced for both M. tuberculosis and M. leprae. M. tuberculosis has surprisingly few
recognizable pathogenicity genes but a large number of
environmental stress components, including 16 environmental sigma factors (discussed in Chapter 8), as well as
250 genes for its complex lipid metabolism. Over half of
the M. leprae genome consists of pseudogenes, homologs of M. tuberculosis genes undergoing reductive evolution (Fig. 18.22B). Thus, M. leprae appears to be an

HO

evolving pathogen “caught in the act” of losing many genes
no longer needed in its sheltered host environment. How
it lost the need for so many genes preserved in M. tuberculosis remains a mystery. M. leprae causes disease worldwide, including 250 cases of leprosy annually in the United
States. In 2013, a new test was approved that reveals leprosy
infection a year before symptoms appear—enabling it to be
cured with antibiotics before nerve damage is irreversible.
Mycobacteria also include a much larger number of
harmless commensals, such as M. smegmatis, isolated from
human skin. Species of mycobacteria can be isolated from
soil and water, as well as from various animal sources. Their
culture is difficult because of their slow growth rates, but
isolation can be enhanced by treatment with a base (NaOH
or KOH) at concentrations that kill most other bacteria.

Note: Distinguish Mycobacterium, rods whose cell walls contain mycolic acids, from Mycoplasma, firmicutes lacking cell walls,
related to Bacillus and Clostridium.

Micrococci are aerobic heterotrophs, commonly isolated
from air and dust, although their habitat of choice is human
skin. Micrococci grow in square or cuboid formations, dividing in two or three planes (Fig. 18.24); cuboid clusters are
known as sarcinae (singular, sarcina). M. luteus is harmless
to humans and grows well at room temperature, so it makes
an excellent laboratory organism for observation by students.

as Lactobacillus and Lactococcus.

Photoheterotrophy

Staphylococcus and Streptococcus are Gram-positive
cocci that include normal human flora, as well as serious
pathogens causing toxic shock syndrome, pneumonia,
and scarlet fever.
Mycoplasmas belong phylogenetically to Firmicutes but
lack the cell wall and S-layer. They have flexible cytoskeletons and show ameboid motility. Mycoplasma species
cause diseases such as meningitis and pneumonia.
Actinobacteria (order Actinomycetales) include mycelial
spore-forming soil bacteria, such as the actinomycete Streptomyces. Other actinobacteria have irregularly shaped cells,
such as Corynebacterium species that cause diphtheria.
Mycobacteria are actinobacterial rods whose cell envelope contains a diverse assemblage of complex mycolic
acids. Mycobacterial species cause tuberculosis and
leprosy. They stain acid-fast.

18.4

Proteobacteria
(Gram-Negative)

Proteobacteria—the “protean,” or “many-formed,” bacteria—show more diverse metabolism than any other phylum.
Their lifestyles range from plant and animal pathogens to soil
lithotrophs that reduce nearly any oxidized metal. Nevertheless, all proteobacteria share a common structure: their Gramnegative cell envelope, which consists of an outer membrane,
peptidoglycan cell wall permeated by the periplasm, and inner
membrane (plasma membrane) (discussed in Chapter 3). The
outer membrane is packed with receptor proteins and porins,
comprising two-thirds of the mass of the membrane. Porins
evolve so as to admit nutrients while excluding antibiotics. The
outer membrane lipids contain long sugar polymer extensions
(lipopolysaccharide, or LPS). In pathogens, LPS repels phagocytosis and has toxic effects when released by dying cells.

The Protean Metabolism
of Proteobacteria

The phylum Proteobacteria is defined to include five
monophyletic classes, labeled Alpha through Epsilon (see
Table 18.1). Even within each closely related group, we see
nearly as wide a range of cell shape and metabolic strategies
as we see in Proteobacteria as a whole.
A closer look at proteobacterial metabolism shows that
processes that at first seem very different actually connect

The protean metabolism of Proteobacteria.

In many Gram-negative species, metabolic diversity arises through
minor “add-ons” of biochemical modules such as light absorption by
bacteriochlorophyll, use of sulfide or organic electron donors, and
use of oxygen or alternative (anaerobic) electron acceptors.

through linked biochemical modules (Fig. 18.25) (metabolism is discussed in detail in Chapter 14). Many proteobacteria can oxidize H 2 (hydrogenotrophy) and small organic
acids, as well as complex organic molecules with aromatic
rings. Some “photoheterolithotrophs” carry out nearly all
the fundamental classes of metabolism, depending on environmental conditions such as availability of light, oxygen,
and nutrients. An example is Rhodopseudomonas palustris, the species of Alphaproteobacteria characterized and
sequenced by Caroline Harwood at the University of Washington (see Fig. 14.39 and eTopic 14.2). In such a “protean”
organism, the core of all proteobacterial energy acquisition
is a respiratory chain of electron donors and acceptors. Electrons may enter the chain from a photoexcited chlorophyll,
from organic electron donors such as sugars or benzoates,
or from a mineral electron donor such as reduced sulfur or
iron (lithotrophy). In facultative anaerobes, the electron
acceptor may be a mineral such as nitrate or sulfate (anaerobic respiration). The capabilities of a given organism depend
on which oxidoreductases its genome encodes.
Photoheterotrophy: light-supplemented heterotrophy. In

the Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, diverse forms
of light absorption have evolved from a common ancestor
of photosystems I and II (see Table 18.2). The various bacteriochlorophylls of Proteobacteria peak in two ranges—in
the blue and in the red or infrared. Bacteriochlorophyll b, in
Blastochloris viridis, peaks well beyond 1,000 nm. Species

CHAPTER 18

with different photopigments often grow together in stratified layers of sediment or wetland—the infrared absorbers below, where they capture the longer wavelengths “left
over” from the shorter-wavelength absorbers above.
The prevalence of homologous photosystems suggests
that the common ancestor of the Gammaproteobacteria
was a photoheterotroph. At the same time, other evidence
supports horizontal transfer of photosystems among proteobacterial branches. The evidence is particularly strong
in the case of proteorhodopsin, a homolog of the retinal protein light-driven proton pump first characterized in
halophilic archaea (discussed in Chapters 14 and 19). The
proteorhodopsin light pump in Pelagibacter, a marine relative of Rickettsia, absorbs green and yellow (wavelength
500–600 nm), the midrange of solar radiation reaching
Earth’s surface. Different species have proteorhodopsins
with very different absorption ranges, apparently adapted
to different niches in the marine ecosystem.
In the literature, proteobacterial phototrophs are historically called “purple bacteria.” The actual colors of all the phototrophs range from purple-red through yellow and brown.
“Purple sulfur bacteria” are species that photolyze reduced
forms of sulfur, such as H2S, HS –, S0, or S2O32– (thiosulfate),

whereas “purple nonsulfur bacteria” photolyze H2 or use
photosystem II for cyclic photophosphorylation (discussed in
Chapter 14). However, it turns out that many purple bacteria
also use photosystem II. Most proteobacterial phototrophs
conduct photosynthesis only in the absence of oxygen, reverting to aerobic heterotrophy when oxygen is present. Some,
however, are obligate anaerobes. Still others, found in marine
environments, surprisingly photolyze sulfide or organic compounds only in the presence of oxygen. Making sense of
this extraordinary diversity is the job of marine and aquatic
microbiologists, particularly those calculating global cycles of
carbon and oxygen (discussed in Chapters 21 and 22).

Thought Question

18.7 Why might genes for the proteorhodopsin light-powered proton pump be more likely to transfer horizontally than
the bacteriochlorophyll-based photosystems PS I and PS II?

evolved multiple times in different clades by modification
of the electron transport chain. Many lithotrophic reactions
generate acid, which conveniently breaks down rock containing additional reduced minerals. Bacterial and archaeal
lithotrophy has tremendous significance for global cycling
of elements in the biosphere (discussed in Chapter 22).
Some lithotrophs are autotrophs, fi xing carbon dioxide
into biomolecules by the Calvin cycle (in carboxysomes) or
the reverse TCA cycle. Others have alternative pathways of
heterotrophy when organic foods are available. An interesting kind of lithotrophy performed by many Proteobacteria
is carbon monoxide (CO) oxidation (eTopic 18.2). Oxidizing CO is important because this toxic substance is a byproduct of animal and plant metabolism.
We now survey species of the major Greek-lettered
classes of Proteobacteria.

Alphaproteobacteria:
Photoheterotrophs, Methylotrophs,
and Endosymbionts

The class Alphaproteobacteria includes photoheterotrophs
and heterotrophs, as well as bacteria metabolizing singlecarbon compounds—along with intracellular mutualists
and pathogens.

Photoheterotrophs. Most alphaproteobacterial photoheterotrophs are unicellular. Their cell shapes range from flagellated spirilla to rounded rods (Rhodobacter sphaeroides)
(Fig. 18.26A), wide spirals (Rhodospirillum rubrum), and
stalked cells (Rhodomicrobium) (Fig. 18.26B). The TEM
of R. sphaeroides in Figure 18.26A shows that the cell is
packed with photomembranes (membranes containing the
photosynthetic complex) arranged in folds or tubes invaginated from the cytoplasmic membrane. These intracellular
photomembranes expand the surface area for photon capture, but during growth with oxygen, the photomembranes

disappear. The outer surface of the cell shows LPS fi laments
extending from the outer membrane.
The metabolism of Rhodospirillum rubrum shifts drastically with oxygen. Anaerobically, R. rubrum bacteria grow
dark red because they synthesize membrane containing BChl
a, which absorbs green and infrared and reflects primarily red.
With oxygen, however, R. rubrum fails to synthesize BChl
a, and the cells grow white as their metabolism switches to
straight heterotrophy. Heterotrophy is supplemented by oxidizing small molecules such as carbon monoxide.
Alphaproteobacterial photoheterotrophs that require
oxygen (but do not photolyze water) were found unexpectedly in genomic surveys of marine bacteria. Originally thought to be straight heterotrophs, these organisms
revealed genes encoding bacteriochlorophyll. Their aerobic heterotrophy was shown to be driven by light absorption. The reason for the oxygen requirement is unclear,
since their photosystems do not involve oxygen. Examples
of O2-requiring phototrophs have since been found in most
of the proteobacterial clades, and species have been isolated
from all major habitats, including freshwater, marine, and
soil ecosystems. Some show unusual cell morphology, such
as the Y shape of Citromicrobium (Fig. 18.26C).
The aerobic photoheterotroph Erythromicrobium ramosum can reduce toxic metal compounds such as tellurite ion
(TeO32–). The cells generate tellurium crystals that take up
30% of their cell weight—a trait that we might use to remove
tellurite from liquid waste. Other toxic metals reduced by
aerobic photoheterotrophs include selenium and arsenic.
Thus, these obscure bacteria now have a promising future in
remediation of metal-contaminated industrial wastes.

often have unusual extended shapes enhancing nutrient
uptake, such as the starlike cell aggregates of Seliberia stellata. In Seliberia species, the individual tightly coiled rods
generate oval or spherical reproductive cells by a budding
process. The budding reproductive cells germinate into
rods, which then form new aggregates.
Some heterotrophs common in soil are pathogens. Brucella species are intracellular pathogens of animals that
can also infect humans. The soil pathogen Granulibacter
bethesdensis is associated with chronic granulomatous disease, an inherited disorder of the phagocyte oxidase system that leaves patients susceptible to infection. Other

pathogens are carried by insects or animal hosts; for example, Bartonella henselae causes cat scratch disease.
Methylotrophy and methanotrophy. Methylotrophy is

the ability of an organism to oxidize reduced single-carbon
compounds such as methanol, methylamine, or methane.
The Alphaproteobacteria include several genera of methylotrophs, which are found in all environments, including
soil, freshwater, and the ocean. Most methylotrophs can
grow on both single-carbon and organic compounds. One
such versatile genus, Methylobacterium, is equally at home
in soil and water, on plant surfaces, and as a contaminant
of facial creams and purified water for silicon chip manufacture. Other species are restricted to single-carbon compounds, incapable of metabolizing organic compounds
with carbon-carbon bonds. Methylotrophs that grow solely
on methane (CH4) are called methanotrophs.
Methane-oxidizing bacteria of both Alpha and Gamma
classes contribute to aquatic ecosystems, serving as major
food sources for zooplankton. They eliminate much of the
methane produced by methanogens before it reaches the
atmosphere, where it has a potent greenhouse effect (see
Chapter 22).
An interesting methylotroph is Hyphomicrobium, a bacterium with an unusual stalk-to-flagellum transition similar

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

Endosymbionts: mutualists and parasites. The Alpha-

proteobacteria include many highly evolved intracellular
symbionts—some mutualists, others parasites. As isolated
bacteria, they are generally rod-shaped with aerobic metabolism, but their shape is transformed within the host cell.
Intracellularly, they need to solve special problems, such as
the exclusion of oxygen from nitrogen fi xation (a process
requiring anaerobiosis) or, in the case of pathogens, the
need to resist host defenses.
Nitrogen-fixing endosymbionts of plants include genera
such as Rhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Sinorhizobium.
The nomenclature has undergone many changes, but the
species are generally referred to as rhizobia. Though they

can live freely in the soil, rhizobia prefer to colonize plants,
usually legumes such as peas or alfalfa, where they form
distinctive nodule structures. Each bacterial species colonizes and infects a particular host range. Complex chemosensory processes attract the bacteria to the surface of
the host root, where their presence induces root hairs to
form curls around the bacteria (Fig. 18.28). The curling of the root hairs enables the bacteria to form infection
threads, chains of rod-shaped bacteria that invade the root
cells. Within the host cells, the bacteria lose their cell wall
and become rounded bacteroids, specialized for nitrogen fixation. The host plant cells provide the bacteroids
with nutrients, as well as protective components such as
leghemoglobin, an oxygen-binding protein that maintains
anaerobiosis within infected cells.
Leghemoglobin turns the nodule
interior pink (Fig. 18.28A).
The
genus
Agrobacterium
includes plant pathogens closely
related to the rhizobia. A. tumefaciens is known for its ability to convert host cells to a form that produces
tumors called galls (Fig. 18.29).
The ability of A. tumefaciens to
insert its DNA into plant genomes
has made it a major tool for plant
biotechnology (see Chapter 16).
Rickettsias are famous intra1 µm
cellular pathogens. Short coccoid
rods, rickettsias lack flagella and
can grow only within a host cell. The best-known rickettsia
is Rickettsia rickettsii, the cause of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, a disease spread by ticks throughout the United
States. Rickettsia species parasitize human endothelial
cells (Fig. 18.30). The bacteria induce phagocytosis and
then dissolve the phagocytic vesicle and escape into the

host cell by polymerizing cytoplasmic actin behind them—
a process similar to that of Listeria (described earlier, along
with Firmicutes). The actin tails eventually project outward
as filopodia, extensions of host cytoplasm and membrane
that protect the bacteria from host defenses while enabling
them to invade adjacent cells.
Genetic analysis shows that the rickettsia clade includes
mitochondria. All eukaryotic mitochondria appear to be
descendants of an ancient rickettsial parasite whose respiratory apparatus ultimately became essential to power
eukaryotic cells.

Lithotrophs: nitrifiers and sulfur oxidizers. An important

group of nitrogen lithotrophs consists of the nitrifiers. Nitrifiers oxidize ammonia (NH3) to nitrite (NO2–), or nitrite to
nitrate (NO3–). Typically, different species conduct the two
reactions separately while coexisting in soil and water. Nitrifiers are of enormous economic and practical importance for
wastewater treatment because they decrease the reduced nitrogen content of sewage. Special systems have been developed
to retain nitrifier bacteria behind filters as one stage of water
treatment. In the system shown in Figure 18.31A, nitrifying
bacteria are encapsulated in pellets to retain them within the
bioreactor while the treated water flows through a filter.
The most commonly isolated ammonia oxidizers are Nitrosomonas species of the Beta class. Nitrosomonas cells conduct

that are either stacked or invaginated (Fig. 18.31B). Related
genera of ammonia oxidizers include Nitrosolobus and
Nitrosovibrio, some with peritrichous or polar flagella. One
ammonia-oxidizing genus of the Gamma group has been
found: Nitrosococcus. Major nitrite oxidizers include the
nonproteobacterial phylum Nitrospirae. Although genetically outside the Proteobacteria, the unusual spiral-shaped
cells of Nitrospirae have a Gram-negative cell envelope.
Pathogens. The Betaproteobacteria include aerobic hetero-

trophic cocci such as Neisseria. The cocci of Neisseria species
form distinctive pairs known as diplococci. Most Neisseria
species are harmless commensals of the nasal or oral mucosa,
but N. gonorrhoeae causes the sexually transmitted disease
gonorrhea. N. gonorrhoeae is actually a microaerophile,
requiring a narrow range of oxygen concentration; it has
fastidious growth requirements, necessitating cultivation on
a special blood-based medium. A related organism, N. meningitidis, may be carried asymptomatically by as much as a
quarter of the human population, but occasionally it causes
meningitis, which can be fatal. Other neisserias, such as
N. sicca, are easily isolated from skin and often presented to
undergraduates as an unknown for identification.
Other members of the Beta class are important animal
and plant pathogens, such as Burkholderia. B. cepacia was
originally isolated from onions as a cause of bulb rot; it
is now known to be a major opportunistic invader of the
lungs of cystic fibrosis patients.

Gammaproteobacteria:
Photolithotrophs, Enteric
Flora, and Pathogens

The Gammaproteobacteria include vast numbers of marine
organisms that catabolize complex organic pollutants such
as petroleum hydrocarbons. However, the best-known
Gammaproteobacteria are the Enterobacteriaceae family of
facultative anaerobes found in the human colon—the family that includes Escherichia coli. Gammaproteobacteria also
include unusual phototrophs that oxidize iron and nitrite.
Sulfur lithotrophs. The sulfur-oxidizing genus Beggiatoa

was one of the fi rst kinds of lithotrophs described by pioneer microbial ecologist Sergei Winogradsky (discussed in
Chapter 1). Beggiatoa species oxidize H 2S to elemental sulfur, which collects as sulfur granules within the periplasm.
Beggiatoa also stores carbon in cytoplasmic granules of
polyhydroxybutyrate—a common strategy among proteobacteria. The cells of Beggiatoa grow as extended fi laments
with visible sulfur granules, forming biofi lms on sulfiderich sediment. Another sulfur oxidizer, the genus Thioploca, forms thick biomats in aquatic sediment. The bacteria
grow as long fi laments that glide through hollow tubes full

Thioploca species emerging from a sheath.
Bacteria of the genus Acidithiobacillus oxidize iron or
sulfur (Fig. 18.33A). Iron-oxidizing bacteria commonly
form the brown stains found inside plumbing. Most species
are short rods or vibrios (comma-shaped). Acidithiobacillus
and other sulfur-oxidizing genera can undergo a number
of different reactions oxidizing H 2S to S0 and S0 to SO42–
(see Table 18.4). Sulfate production makes an environment
acidic enough to erode stone monuments and the interior

coupled to oxidation of iron, Fe2+ → Fe3+. The bacterium
A. ferrooxidans is known for its role in acidification of mine
water, which contributes to leaching of iron, copper, and
other minerals (Fig. 18.33B).
Sulfur and iron phototrophs. The Gamma group photo-

trophs, such as Chromatium species (Fig. 18.34A), mainly
utilize sulfide and produce sulfur, which is deposited as
intracellular granules visible within the cytoplasm. Their
phototrophy is entirely anaerobic. Some of the Gamma
group are true autotrophs and do not use organic substrates. Some of these actually conduct phototrophy using
iron (Fe2+) to donate electrons. Iron phototrophy, or “photoferrotrophy” (Fig. 18.34B), is considered an intriguing possibility for the metabolism of early life (discussed
in Chapter 17). Thiocapsa uses NO2 – and was the fi rst
nitrogen-based phototroph discovered.

all bacterial species—is the model organism Escherichia coli.
Some strains of E. coli grow normally in the human intestine,
feeding on our mucous secretions and producing vitamins,
such as vitamin K. They may grow in symbiosis with anaerobic fermenters such as Bacteroides species, which release
short-chain sugars that E. coli digests (discussed in Chapter 21). But other strains, such as E. coli O157:H7, cause serious illness. A large proportion of the world’s children die of
E. coli–related intestinal illness before the age of 5. Related
pathogens include Salmonella enterica and Shigella flexneri.
The Enterobacteriaceae are Gram-negative rods,
although as nutrients diminish, their size dwindles almost
to a coccoid form. They grow singly, in chains, or in biofilms. Many species are motile, with numerous flagella.
Most strains grow well with or without oxygen, by either
respiration (aerobic or anaerobic) or fermentation. They
ferment rapidly on carbohydrates, generating fermentation
acids, ethanol, and gases (CO2 plus H 2) in varying proportions, depending on the species. Their presence in the
intestine supports the growth of organisms utilizing these
gases, including methanogens (discussed in Chapter 19).
Many strains form biofilms. Biofilm formation explains the
persistence of drug-resistant infections, such as those associated with urinary catheters in long-term hospital patients.

Because they are easy to cultivate and have been studied extensively in clinical laboratories, many genera of
Enterobacteriaceae are familiar to students in introductory
microbiology laboratory courses. A common laboratory
exercise is to distinguish Enterobacter and Klebsiella species from E. coli
by their fermentation to the pH-neutral product butanediol, which tests
positive in the Voges-Proskauer test.

The Deltaproteobacteria include important sulfur and iron

complex life cycles that include multicellular developmental forms. The best-studied example is the myxobacteria.
Myxobacteria have exceptionally large genomes, such as

thus, are free-living soil bacteria that can grow as isolated
cells but come together to form a multicellular structure
for the purpose of spore dispersal (Fig. 18.39; also see
Fig. 18.8D). When nutrients are plentiful, the myxobacteria grow and divide as individual cells. As nutrients run out,
the cells begin to attract each other, moving into parallel
formations. Myxobacteria have no flagella, but they move
along a surface by using a form of motility called gliding.
The formations develop into a bulging mass, and the
aggregating cells coalesce to develop a fruiting body. The

evolved their process independently. Within the myxobacterial fruiting body, durable spherical cells called myxospores develop (Fig. 18.40). Ultimately, the fruiting body
releases the myxospores to be carried on the wind or by
insects to a more favorable location.

the inner membrane to degrade host macromolecules and
make their components available to the bdellovibrio. The
entire host cell loses its shape and becomes a protective incubator for the predator. This stage is called the bdelloplast.
Within the periplasm, the invading bdellovibrio elongates as a spiral filament while replicating several copies of
its DNA. When most nutrients have been exhausted, the
filament septates into multiple short cells. The cells develop
flagella, and the bdelloplast bursts, releasing the newly
formed attack cells (Fig. 18.41B).
Bdellovibrios can be isolated from sewage, soil, or
marine water—any environmental source of Gram-negative
prey bacteria. Different species infect E. coli and Pseudomonas, as well as Agrobacterium and Rhizobium in their freeliving state. They can be cultured as plaques on a top-agar

famously swallowed a Helicobacter culture to prove these
bacteria cause gastritis.
H. pylori and related species grow primarily on the stomach epithelium, at about pH 6, which is less acidic than the
gastric contents (pH 2–4). The bacteria bury themselves in
the epithelial layer and neutralize their acidic surroundings
by making urease enzyme, which converts urea to ammonia and carbon dioxide. Helicobacter species form wide spiral cells (spirilla) with an unusual grouping of flagella at
one end. The metabolism of H. pylori is microaerophilic,
requiring a low level of oxygen. The bacteria can be isolated
through biopsy of the gastric mucosa.
Several groups of related Epsilonproteobacteria are sulfur
oxidizers and sulfur reducers, found in marine and aquatic
habitats. Thiovulum species oxidize sulfides aerobically,
using oxygen available in marine water. In deep-ocean sediment, near hydrothermal vents, hydrogenotrophs Nautilia
and Hydrogenimonas oxidize H 2 using sulfur or nitrate.
These bacteria enrich the marine habitat by cycling carbon,
nitrogen, and sulfur. Surprisingly, genes from Epsilonproteobacteria are found in the sequenced genomes of deepbranching taxa, the Aquifex species (see Section 18.1). Like
other hyperthermophiles, the Epsilons “get around,” with
their genes migrating into distantly related organisms.

Alphaproteobacteria include photoheterotrophs (such
as Rhodospirillum) and heterotrophs, as well as methylotrophs. They include intracellular mutualists such as rhizobia, and pathogens such as the rickettsias. Rickettsias
share ancestry with mitochondria.
Betaproteobacteria include photoheterotrophs (Rhodocyclus), as well as nitrifiers (Nitrosomonas) and ironsulfur oxidizers (Thiobacillus). Pathogenic diplococci
include Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the cause of gonorrhea.
Gammaproteobacteria include sulfur and iron bacteria (Acidithiobacillus, Chromatium). The most famous

Deep-Branching
Gram-Negative Phyla

Do other phyla besides Proteobacteria possess an outer
membrane and stain Gram-negative? Some Gram-negative
bacteria branch more deeply from the Proteobacteria than
the five Greek-lettered classes do from each other, and they
are thus classified as separate phyla. Most members of these
phyla (though not all) are obligate anaerobes. They have
diverse lifestyles and habitats, from aquatic phototrophs to
human pathogens. Major phyla include Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlorobi, Fusobacteria, and Nitrospirae.

Acidobacteria

Acidobacteria are abundant in soils, where they metabolize a
wide range of organic substrates using diverse electron acceptors. Many species grow in extreme conditions, such as in the
presence of acid and metals—for example, in soils contaminated by uranium mining. Others grow at high temperature,
such as isolate K22 (Fig. 18.43) obtained from the Taupo
Volcanic Zone, New Zealand, by GNS Science, a geoscience
prospecting company. The thin section of isolate K22 in Figure 18.43B shows its extensive outer membrane.
The candidate species Chloracidobacterium thermophilum is a thermophilic aerobic phototroph, isolated
from Octopus Spring, at Yellowstone National Park. This
acidobacterium is a photoheterotroph that supplements

It grows chlorosomes similar to those of Chloroflexi (see
Section 18.1). These distantly related organisms may have
shared photosynthesis genes via horizontal gene transfer.

Bacteroidetes

The phylum Bacteroidetes includes genera such as Bacteroides and Flavobacterium. Bacteroides species, such as B. fragilis and B. thetaiotaomicron, are the major inhabitants of
the human colon (Fig. 18.44). Their envelope polysaccharides help the bacteria evade the immune system. Bacteroides species grow anaerobically under extremely low oxygen
concentrations such as those found in the human intestine
(1 ppm), yet they can actually use the oxygen they find;
thus they have been called “nanoaerobes.”
Their main source of energy is fermentation of a wide
range of sugar derivatives from plant material, compounds

that are indigestible by humans and potentially toxic (discussed in Chapter 13). Bacteroides bacteria convert these
substances into simple sugars and fermentation acids, some
of which are absorbed by the intestinal epithelium; others feed associated gut bacteria such as E. coli (discussed
in Chapter 21). Thus, Bacteroides species serve important
functions for their host: They break down potential toxins
in plant foods, and their fermentation products make up
as much as 15% of the caloric value we obtain from food.
Yet another benefit of Bacteroides is their ability to remove
side chains from bile acids, enabling the return of bile
acids to the hepatic circulation. In effect, our gut bacteria,
including Bacteroides, constitute a functional organ of the
human body.
Bacteroides species cause trouble, however, when they
reach parts of the body not designed to host them. During abdominal surgery, bacteria can escape the colon and
invade the surrounding tissues. The displaced bacteria can
form an abscess, a localized mass of bacteria and pus contained in a cavity of dead tissue. The interior of the abscess
is anaerobic and often impenetrable to antibiotics.

■ Bacteroides fragilis cells colonize the human colon. B. fragilis causes intestinal infections (colorized SEM).

The Chlorobi (mainly Chlorobium species) are known
informally as green sulfur bacteria. While they are genetically close to Bacteroides, their metabolism is surprisingly
different. Chlorobi are strict photolithotrophs, using PS I
to split electrons from H 2, H 2S, or other reduced sulfur
compounds (Fig. 18.45; see also Table 18.2). During the
oxidation of sulfide, Chlorobium species deposit elemental sulfur extracellularly, forming attached sulfur globules (Fig. 18.45A). In contrast, the sulfur granules of
Gammaproteobacteria such as Chromatium are deposited
internally.

The phylum Nitrospirae consists of Gram-negative spiral
bacteria that oxidize nitrite ion to nitrate (NO2 – to NO3 –).
Their cell structure resembles that of the Proteobacteria, although their phylogenetic branch is deep enough
for assignment to a separate phylum. Most species, such
as Nitrospira species (see Tables 18.1 and 18.4), are true
lithotrophs or autotrophs, fixing carbon in the form of
carbon dioxide or carbonate using carboxysomes. Nitrospira species are generally found in freshwater or salt water.
Their removal of excess nitrite makes a key contribution to
aquatic ecosystems.
Another important genus is Leptospirillum, which
includes acidophilic iron oxidizers. Leptospirillum species are also strict autotrophs, fixing carbon by using Fe2+
as their electron donor and O2 as the electron acceptor.
Their metabolism generates acid, contributing to acid mine
drainage in iron mines at Iron Mountain, California, where
they grow in massive pink biofilms.

To Summarize
Chlorobium species require extensive membrane systems
full of photopigments for light absorption. The chlorophyll reaction centers of Chlorobium are contained within
chlorosomes associated with the cytoplasmic membrane
(Fig. 18.45B), similar to chlorosomes of the deep-branching phylum Chloroflexi. The photopigment of Chlorobium is predominantly BChl c, which absorbs in the blue
(460 nm) and near-infrared (750 nm), thus reflecting the
middle range, brownish green.

Note:

Distinguish phylum Chlorobi (sulfur photoautotrophs)
from phylum Chloroflexi (thermophilic filamentous photoheterotrophs). Both taxa are phototrophs containing green photopigment
complexes arranged in chlorosomes, but they are deeply divergent
genetically.

instead, dark-field, fluorescence, or electron microscopy
must be used. T. pallidum is not culturable in the laboratory, but its genome sequence reveals much about its physiology. The genome of 1.1 million base pairs (presented in
eTopic 13.3) is highly degenerate, lacking nearly all components of biosynthesis and of the TCA cycle; its only system
for ATP production is glycolysis.
The spirochete genus Borrelia includes two pathogens
that cause serious tick-borne diseases in the United States. B.
recurrentis causes relapsing fever (Fig. 18.46C). The related
species B. burgdorferi causes Lyme disease known for the distinctive bull’s-eye rash (Fig. 18.46D). A unique feature of
Borrelia species is their multipartite genome. Each species
possesses a linear main chromosome of less than a million
base pairs, plus a number of linear and circular plasmids. B.
burgdorferi, for example, has a linear chromosome of 910,725
base pairs, with at least 17 linear and circular plasmids that
total an additional 533,000 base pairs. The reason for this
unusual fragmentation of Borrelia genomes is unknown.
Spirochetes include important pathogens of animals,
such as Leptospira, the cause of leptospirosis, a form of
nephritis (kidney inflammation) with complications in the
liver and other organs. Leptospira cells are known for the
peculiar L shape of the cell, as each end of the spirochete
turns out at an angle. Members of the genus Treponema
also cause digital dermatitis in cattle and sheep. As in other
bacterial phyla, however, the pathogenic species are far outnumbered by harmless organisms.

(Fig. 18.46A). For many species, the spiral is so thin that
its width cannot be resolved by bright-field microscopy, and
the organisms can pass through a filter of pore size 2 µm.

flagella (axial fibrils) rotate on proton-driven motors, as
do regular flagella; but because they twine back around
the cell body, their rotation forces the entire cell to twist
around, corkscrewing through the medium.
This corkscrew motion of the cell body turns out to
have a physical advantage in highly viscous environments,
such as human mucous secretions or agar culture medium.
Few nonspirochetes can swim through agar at standard
culture concentrations (1.5% agar); thus, growth within
agar provides a way to isolate anaerobic spirochetes from
environmental sources. When an environmental sample is
inoculated into agar, other bacteria grow and concentrate
at the injection point, whereas spirochetes migrate outward
in a “veil” through the agar.

Verrucomicrobia:
Irregular Cells

Several related phyla of bacteria have either no cell walls
or diminished cell walls. These organisms evolved independently of the mycoplasmas, and their alternative cell forms
show diverse environmental adaptations.

Chlamydiae: Intracellular Parasites

In the phylum Chlamydiae, the genera Chlamydia and
Chlamydophila evolved complex developmental life cycles
of parasitizing host cells. Chlamydia trachomatis causes the
most prevalent sexually transmitted infection among young
people in the United States. The same pathogen also causes
trachoma, an eye disease dating back to records in ancient
Egypt. The related species Chlamydophila pneumoniae
causes pneumonia and has been implicated in cardiovascular disease.

■ Chlamydia life cycle. A. C. trachomatis, multiplying within a human cell (colorized TEM). Infected cell, equivalent
to step 5 in part (B), contains reticulate bodies (yellow) growing and
dividing, as well as newly formed elementary bodies (red). B. Chlamydia species persist outside the host as a spore-like “elementary
body.” Upon endocytosis, the elementary body avoids lysosomal
fusion and develops into a “reticulate body” in which the DNA, now
uncondensed, has a reticular (netlike) appearance. The reticulate
body replicates within the host cytoplasm and then develops into
new elementary bodies that are released when the cell lyses.

Chlamydiae alternate between two developmental stages
with different functions: elementary bodies and reticulate
bodies (Fig. 18.48A). The form of chlamydia transmitted outside host cells is called an elementary body. Like
endospores, elementary bodies are metabolically inert, with
a compacted chromosome. While lacking a cell wall, they
possess an outer membrane whose proteins are cross-linked
by disulfide bonds, making a tough coat that provides
osmotic stability. The elementary body adheres to a host
cell surface and is endocytosed (Fig. 18.48B).
To reproduce, the elementary body must transform itself
into a reticulate body, named for the netlike appearance

■

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

of its uncondensed DNA. The reticulate body has an active
metabolism and divides rapidly, but outside the cell it is
incapable of infection and vulnerable to osmotic shock.
To complete the infection cycle, therefore, reticulate bodies must develop into new elementary bodies before exiting the host. When the host cell lyses, the elementary
bodies are released to infect new cells. Chlamydiae infect a
wide range of host cell types, from respiratory epithelium
to macrophages.

A.

Planctomycetes: A NucleusLike Compartment

Another cell wall–less group, the Planctomycetes, evolved
largely as free-living organisms. Planctomycetes are oligotrophs, heterotrophs requiring nutrients at extremely
low concentrations. They grow in aquatic, marine, and
saline environments. Their mechanism of osmoregulation
remains poorly understood.
Planctomycete
cells
possess
multiple
internal membrane compartments of unknown function
(Fig. 18.49A). An internal membrane just inside the cell
membrane divides the cytoplasm into concentric portions. A double membrane surrounds the entire nucleoid, analogous to the double membrane surrounding
the eukaryotic nucleus—a remarkable example of independent analogous evolution between bacteria and the
eukaryotes. The actual function of the nucleoid-surrounding membrane varies with different species; for
example, in anammox planctomycetes, a single membrane enclosing the nucleoid contains the complexes
conducting the anammox reaction (anaerobic ammonium oxidation; discussed in Chapter 14).
Like eukaryotic protists (discussed in Chapter 20),
the planctomycetes have f lexible cell bodies that can
assume diverse forms. For example, some Planctomyces species have rotary f lagella (Fig. 18.49B), whereas
P. bekefii cells have stalks that attach to each other to
generate a starlike aggregate (Fig. 18.49C). Most planctomycetes reproduce by budding, a strategy typical of
eukaryotic yeasts.

Verrucomicrobia, or “wrinkled microbes,” are irregularly
shaped bacteria found in a wide variety of aquatic and terrestrial environments, as well as in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (see Table 18.1). Most Verrucomicrobia are
oligotrophs, growing heterotrophically in low-salt habitats. Some are ectosymbionts of protists, attached to the
cell surface of the eukaryote, where they eject harpoon-like
objects. They are rarely cultured, and until recently they

hooks that connect neighboring cells in a biofilm matrix. The
matrix of grappling hooks also coats filaments of sulfideoxidizing bacteria that may cooperate with Altiarchaeum.

for global climate. Many archaea collaborate with

The ultrastructural analyses of Altiarchaeum were breathtaking, especially
the discovery of the “hami.” The hami

19.1 Archaeal Traits and Phylogeny

How did your research on archaea prepare you to investigate microbes on board the International Space Station?
Our methods found that Archaea are a substantial part of
the human skin microbiome. I am driven by the idea that
Archaea are everywhere, and that we just need to use the
right methods to understand their biology. I obtained an
award from the European Space Agency for a comprehensive microbiome analysis of the International Space Station in order to find interesting Archaea and Bacteria there
and to identify the potential adaptations to this very interesting habitat. Such analysis will help us understand the
mechanisms of an encapsulated ecosystem, the impact
of microbes on long-term spaceflight, and the adaptation
capacity of a microbial community.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

In 1977, Carl Woese revealed the existence of a third kind
of life—the Archaea, a domain of life-forms very different
from the plants, animals, and bacteria that had long been
known. Today, the Archaea continue to yield surprises. An
example is the candidate species Altiarchaeum hamiconexum, first known as the SM1 euryarchaeon discovered in
2004 by Rudolph Huber and his students at the University
of Regensburg, Germany. The marsh-dwelling microbe is
an archaeon related to methanogens, and it appears to fix
CO2, but its precise metabolism remains unknown. Christine Moissl-Eichinger (see the Current Research Highlight)
showed how this organism forms netlike biofilms by use of
grappling-hook appendages, called hami (singular, hamus)
(Fig. 19.1). Each grappling hook contains paired barbs
along an extended protein filament many times the length
of the cell. The filament ends with a triple fishhook that
enables filaments to clasp each other. No other kind of cell
is known to make this type of appendage.
Archaea are known for extremophiles, such as hyperthermophiles growing above 100°C and hyperacidophiles at
below pH 1. Extremophiles are of interest to biotechnology
because their enzymes may catalyze reactions under industrially useful conditions, such as high salt or acidity. But we
also find archaea throughout mesophilic soil and water, and
within the digestive tracts of humans and other animals.
Moissl-Eichinger even discovered archaea on human skin,
comprising more than 4% of the skin’s prokaryotic microbiome. She argues that archaea exist everywhere, in every livable habitat; we just need the right methods to find them.
How do archaea in “moderate” habitats interact with
bacteria and eukaryotes? Many archaea join bacteria
A.

within biofilms in soil and on marine particles. For example, Altiarchaeum envelops sulfide-oxidizing bacteria
in its grappling appendages to form thick biofilms like
pearls on a string. Other archaea cooperate with eukaryotes, for example, by colonizing the surface of plant roots.
Even in these shared habitats, archaea show unique traits,
such as energy-yielding methanogenesis and cyclic diether
membranes. Perhaps the most compelling unique feature of
archaea, from the human point of view, is that no archaea
are known to cause disease. Recent reports find gut methanogens associated with the inflammatory response, but
no causal relationship has yet been demonstrated.
In Chapter 19 we explore the diversity of archaea. We
emphasize the unique structures and metabolic pathways
of archaeal cells. While surveying their major taxonomic
categories, we introduce research techniques used to study
organisms in extreme environments and those with unique
forms of metabolism, such as methanogenesis.

19.1

Archaeal Traits
and Phylogeny

Key traits such as ether-linked membrane lipids are found
only in archaea, and in a few bacteria that received them
by horizontal gene flow from archaea. Other traits, such as
diverse pathways of redox metabolism, archaea share with
bacteria. But archaea share core traits of DNA-RNA machinery and transcription factors with eukaryotes. Genomic analysis suggests that eukaryotes possess an archaeal ancestor.

Archaeal Cell Structure and Metabolism

Distinctive features of archaea, sometimes called “archaeal
signatures,” include components of the cell membrane and
envelope and certain metabolic pathways to gain energy
(Table 19.1).
Isoprenoid membranes. The most distinctive structure of

archaea is their membrane (Fig. 19.2). The membrane lipids of archaea differ profoundly from those of bacteria and
eukaryotes, with the exception of a few thermophilic bacteria
that obtained ether lipids horizontally from archaea. Most
features of archaeal lipids increase lipid stability in extreme
environments such as high temperature or extreme acidity.
Nevertheless, ether lipids are also widespread in mesophiles
(grow at moderate temperatures). Some researchers argue
that the original archaea were hyperthermophiles but later
evolved as mesophiles by acquiring genes from bacteria.
Archaeal lipids contain distinctive structures that differ
from those of bacteria and eukaryotes:

■ L-Glycerol.

Archaeal membrane lipids incorporate L-glycerol (Fig. 19.2A), rather than the mirrorsymmetrical form D-glycerol, which is used by bacteria
and eukaryotes. The two chiral forms show similar thermal stability, but their biochemistry requires different
enzymes, and thus they represent a deep divergence in
ancestry. In some archaea the glycerol is extended by six
carbons, forming nonitol (nine OH groups).

■

Ether linkage. The glycerol units are linked to side chains
by ether links (R–O–R) instead of the ester links (R–
COO–R) found in bacteria and eukaryotes (Fig. 19.2A).
Ether links are much more stable than ester links; in other
words, breaking them requires more energy.

■

Isoprenoid chains. The side chains of archaeal lipids are
branched at every fourth carbon. The methyl branches
arise by condensation (C–C bond formation) of units of
isoprene (see Fig. 19.2A). Condensed isoprene chains

are called isoprenoid or diphytanyl chains; thus, the
overall lipid is diphytanylglycerol diether. Isoprenoid
branched chains increase membrane stability by hooking
each other in place.
■

Cross-linked lipids. In some hyperthermophiles, the
ends of side chains are linked covalently, either to each
other (Fig. 19.2B) or to a lipid on the opposite side of
the membrane (Fig. 19.2C). Two pairs of lipid chains
cross-linked across the membrane form a tetraether,
so called because the complex contains four ether links
in all. In some cases, an additional covalent bond links
the two linked pairs of side chains across the middle
(Fig. 19.2D).

■

Cyclopentane rings. In some archaea, the lipid’s
methyl branches cyclize, forming cyclopentane rings
(Fig. 19.2E). Cyclopentane rings strengthen membranes at high temperature.

brane, without any outer membrane such as that of
Gram-negative bacteria (shown in Chapter 3). Many,
such as the thermophilic crenarchaeotes, possess no cell
wall at all, but only an S-layer of proteins plugged into
the tetraether membrane (Fig. 19.3). The S-layer proteins of Sulfolobus species lock together to form a sturdy
array (Fig. 19.3A). While helping to keep the cell intact,
the S-layer protein array nonetheless allows a flexible
cell structure, in contrast to the more rigid structures of
most bacteria.
Some archaea do have a cell wall, but the structure
differs fundamentally from the bacterial peptidoglycan.
The methanogen Methanothermus (Fig. 19.3B) has a
peptide-sugar sacculus that is composed not of murein
(see Chapter 3), but of a related macromolecule called
pseudomurein or pseudopeptidoglycan. Pseudopeptidoglycan contains chains of alternating sugar derivatives
including N-acetylglucosamine, as in bacterial peptidoglycan. The bacterial N-acetylmuramic acid, however, is
replaced by a related sugar, N-acetyltalosaminuronic acid;
and the sugar linkage is β(1,3) instead of β(1,4) as in bacteria. As a result, these archaea are resistant to lysozyme,
which degrades bacterial cell walls at the β(1,4) sugar linkage. The peptide cross-bridges of pseudopeptidoglycan
differ as well, causing resistance to penicillin (discussed
in Chapter 3).
Similarly, many archaea possess filamentous protein
structures for attachment and motility that are analogous
to bacterial pili and flagella. Despite functional similarity,
the archaeal protein structures are very different from those
of bacteria. Archaeal flagella have rotary motors, but their
distinctive form earns them the name “archaella” (singular,
archaellum).
Unique metabolic pathways. Archaea utilize many distinctive metabolic pathways. Glucose is catabolized
by several variants of the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) and

generating pyruvate with no net production of ATP. (ATP
is still produced by further breakdown of pyruvate.) On
the other hand, halophilic archaea such as Halobacterium phosphorylate the dehydrated product of gluconate
(2-oxo-3-deoxygluconate), which enters the “standard”
ED pathway. The ED pathway generates one molecule
of pyruvate and one molecule of 3-phosphoglycerate,
which produces one net ATP through the second stage
of the EMP pathway. A unique variant of the EMP pathway is seen in the vent thermophile Pyrococcus furiosus,
which oxidizes glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate using ferredoxin instead of NAD+ and avoids phosphorylation. The
reduced ferredoxin is then used to reduce 2H+ to H 2 in an
energy-yielding reaction.
The energy-yielding process of methanogenesis occurs
only in archaea. Methane production by methanogenic
archaea (methanogens) makes a growing contribution to
global warming, as discussed in Chapter 22. Methanogenesis includes a unique pathway of carbon fixation, called
the carbon monoxide reductase pathway because the key
enzyme can fix CO as well as CO2. A CO group is fixed
into acetyl-CoA by condensation with a methyl group generated by methanogenesis. Acetyl-CoA then enters the
TCA cycle. Methanogenesis also uses unique cofactors
that largely replace NAD, FAD, and FMN (discussed in
Section 19.4).
The only known form of phototrophy in archaea is that
of retinal-based ion pumps. Membrane protein complexes
known as bacteriorhodopsin and halorhodopsin contain
retinal and pumps for H+ or Na+ (discussed in Chapter 14).
Bacteriorhodopsins are found in haloarchaea (formerly
called halobacteria) such as Halobacterium halobium; the
species was named before it was known to be an archaeon
(discussed in Section 19.5). It turns out that haloarchaea
have transferred genes encoding light-absorbing proton
pumps into many marine bacteria. By contrast, the chlorophyll-based phototrophy found in bacteria and plants is
completely unknown in archaea.

Archaeal Genome Structure
and Regulation

How do archaeal genomes compare with those of bacteria and eukaryotes? The genomes of archaea generally
resemble those of bacteria in size and gene density, and
genes of related function are often arranged in operons,
like those of bacteria. Nevertheless, certain features of
genome structure are unique to archaea, and some traits
more closely resemble those of eukaryotes than those of
bacteria.

740

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

A distinctive feature of archaeal chromosome function is
the “reverse gyrase” enzyme found in hyperthermophiles.
For comparison, all bacteria and eukaryotes, as well as
mesophilic archaea, have gyrase to maintain their DNA in
an “underwound” negatively supercoiled state (presented
in Chapter 7). But hyperthermophilic archaea with reverse
gyrase maintain positive supercoiling to stabilize their
DNA. The positive superturns “overwind” the DNA, preventing the helix from melting into separate strands at high
temperature.
A unique feature of archaeal RNA is the distinctive
modified bases in their tRNA molecules. In particular, the

guanosine analog archaeosine (7-formamidino-7-deazaguanosine) is used by nearly all archaea, but not by any
bacteria or eukaryotes. Other unusual tRNA bases, such as
queuosine, are found only in bacteria and eukaryotes, not
in archaea.
The genes encoding most archaeal proteins contain
uninterrupted coding sequences, as in bacteria, but certain tRNA gene sequences are interrupted by introns (nontranslated sequence), similar to the tRNA introns found
in eukaryotes. Furthermore, the archaeal apparatus for
DNA and RNA polymerases, transcription factors, and
protein synthesis show remarkable similarity to those of

eukaryotes. Figure 19.5A compares the components of an
archaeal RNA polymerase (from Sulfolobus) with those of
eukaryotic RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that catalyzes
synthesis of messenger RNA. The archaeal polymerase possesses two transcription factors (regulatory protein components) that are found in eukaryotes: TATA-binding protein
(TBP, a subunit of transcription factor II D, TFIID) and
transcription factor II B (TFIIB, which in archaea is designated TFB). By contrast, bacteria have no homologs of
these factors. A consequence of the eukaryotic-like transcription and translation in archaea is that archaea are resistant to antibacterial antibiotics that target transcription
and translation.
Another eukaryotic structure for which archaeal homologs were discovered is that of histones, the fundamental
packaging proteins of DNA. The histone complex found
in eukaryotic chromosomes contains a histone (H3 + H4)2
tetramer flanked by two histone (H2A + H2B) dimers.
The archaeal homologs form an (H3 + H4)2 tetramer, with
no (H2A + H2B) homologs. John Reeve and colleagues
at the Ohio State University (Fig. 19.5B) showed that

isolated DNA of specific sequences could be bound and
curved around a histone tetramer from the methanogen
Methanothermus fervidus (Fig. 19.5C). The DNA has ATrich sequences that specifically fit the histone complex. The
key sequences of the histones (the ones that bind to DNA)
show homology to eukaryotic histones. Histones have since
been found in many species of archaea.

Phylogeny of Archaea

What are the major kinds of Archaea? The domain includes
three phyla, also called divisions, that have been extensively
characterized (Fig. 19.6). These phyla are Crenarchaeota,
Thaumarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota. In addition, a
growing number of phyla emerge through exploring the
sequences of environmental samples, such as the Ancient
Archaeal Group (AAG) of vent hyperthermophiles and
benthic subsurface communities. Major taxa are outlined
in Table 19.2. An expanded version of this table appears

CHAPTER 19

For several reasons, the phylogeny of Archaea is a challenge to define. Most archaea are uncultured and are
known solely through small-subunit (SSU) rRNA sequence
or through metagenomics (the genome sequences of a
microbial community). Many of their genomes are highly
“recombinogenic.” For example, two different samples of
Ferroplasma acidarmanus show 99% identical SSU rRNA,
yet their overall genomes differ by 22%, implying extensive
horizontal gene exchange. And many archaeal genomes,
particularly those of mesophiles, include large portions
of DNA transferred from bacteria. (In Figure 19.6, the
starred taxa contain more than 20% bacterial genes.)
Microbial ecologist Purificación López-García, Université
Paris-Sud, proposes that hyperthermophilic archaeal species evolved into mesophiles by acquiring genes from bacteria. According to her model, the bacterial genes provided
key metabolic pathways and cell structures optimized for
growth at moderate or cold temperatures.
Finally, deeply branching clades such as the Ancient
Archaeal Group (AAG) have such divergent SSU rRNA
that their sequence fails to amplify with “standard” PCR
primers based on the most highly conserved regions of the
gene. Much “dark matter” remains unknown, as yet undetected by our current molecular tools.

Note:

The phylogeny of Archaea undergoes frequent revision,
as new taxa are discovered and novel genomes are sequenced. For
example, the taxa now designated Thaumarchaeota were originally
classified with the Crenarchaeota, until multilocus genome comparison revealed the deeper division between the two clades.

Crenarchaeota. The Crenarchaeota include a substantial

proportion of soil, marine, and benthic (marine sediment)
microbial communities and are found in the microbiomes
of plants and animals. Understanding these organisms is
important for assessing their contribution to the global carbon cycle.
A fascinating group of crenarchaeotes is the thermophiles. Many thermophilic crenarchaeotes metabolize
sulfur, either by anaerobic reduction (such as by H 2 to
form H 2S) or by aerobic oxidation (by O2 to form sulfuric acid). Anaerobic sulfur metabolizers include moderate
thermophiles (growth range about 60°C–80°C), as well
as hyperthermophiles (90°C–120°C). Many of the hyperthermophiles are also barophiles, growing under high pressure at hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor; an example
is Pyrodictium abyssi. Yet other crenarchaeotes are mesophiles (growing at moderate temperatures) and even psychrophiles (growing at temperatures below 20°C), found
in Antarctic lakes. Overall, the Crenarchaeota encompass
the widest range of growth temperature of any division
of life.

Thaumarchaeota. The phylum Thaumarchaeota includes

mesophiles originally classified with Marine Group I Crenarchaeota but now recognized as a distinct clade very important for marine environments. Thaumarchaeota include
ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), which oxidize ammonia to nitrite. These ammonia oxidizers play a major role in
the nitrogen cycle (discussed in Chapters 21 and 22). Other
Thaumarchaeota include mesophilic heterotrophs and sulfur oxidizers in soil and water. Some are key symbionts of
invertebrate animals such as deep-sea sponges.
Lokiarchaeota. A recently characterized clade of deep-sea

archaea is the Lokiarchaeota, branching from the DeepSea Archaeal Group/Marine Benthic Group B (DSAG/
MBGB). First identified at a thermal vent named Loki’s
Castle, the Lokiarchaeota genomes share surprising traits
with eukaryotes. Eukaryotic-like genes found in Lokiarchaeota include those associated with an actin cytoskeleton
and phagocytosis. These features suggest that Lokiarchaeota may descend from a common ancestor of a cell that
contributed to the ancestral eukaryote.
Euryarchaeota. The phylum Euryarchaeota also includes

members throughout soil and water, and associated with
plants and animals. They show a greater range of metabolism than the Crenarchaeota. The most highly divergent
group of Euryarchaeota is the methanogens. Methanogens
serve a key energetic role in ecosystems by offering an
anaerobic mechanism for removing excess H 2 and other
small-molecule reductants. Despite their common energetic pathway, methanogens branch deeply among other
euryarchaeotic groups, and they show a wide range of
cell shape and environmental adaptations. One branch
of euryarchaeotes is the Haloarchaea, extreme halophiles
that are the only form of life to grow in concentrated brine
(NaCl). Most haloarchaea, such as Halobacterium species
NRC-1, are photoheterotrophs that can supplement their
metabolism with light-driven ion pumps.
Euryarchaeotes include extreme acidophiles, as well
as extreme alkaliphiles. With respect to pH, the euryarchaeotes show the widest range of any clade, from Ferroplasma (order Thermococcales), growing at pH 0, to
Natronococcus, growing at pH 10.

Note:

In Table 19.2, certain archaeal names contain a “bacteria”
component—for example, the genus Halobacterium. Such organisms were known and named as bacteria before 1977, when the category “archaea” was first defined.

Emerging phyla. Besides the major phyla Crenarchaeota,
Thaumarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota, metagenomic analysis continues to reveal new clades that branch near the

744

root of the tree. The Miscellaneous Crenarchaeota Group
(MCG) was reclassified in 2015 as the deep-branching
group Bathyarchaeota, capable of methanogenesis. The
Bathyarchaeota are the only known methanogens outside
of the Euryarchaeota. An even deeper branch is the Ancient
Archaeal Group (AAG), discovered in hydrothermal vents
and deep benthic sediment. The AAG organisms fail to
be detected by PCR primers based on known SSU rRNA
gene sequences. Instead, their detection requires reverse
transcription of rRNA from uncultured cells. The reverse
transcripts have shown that the rRNA sequence of AAG
organisms differs by 20% from the most conserved regions
of other known archaeal rRNA.

To Summarize

■

Glucose is catabolized by variants of the ED pathway. Other metabolic pathways found in archaea include
methanogenesis and retinal-associated light-driven ion
pumps such as bacteriorhodopsin.
Central genetic functions of archaea resemble those
of eukaryotes, as seen in the structure of DNA and
RNA polymerases and of histone-like DNA-binding
proteins.
The most studied phyla or divisions of archaea
are Crenarchaeota, Thaumarchaeota, and Euryarchaeota. Crenarchaeota include sulfur hyperthermophiles, mesophiles, and psychrophiles. Thaumarchaeota
include ammonia oxidizers, marine invertebrate symbionts, and others. Euryarchaeota include methanogens,
halophiles, and acidophiles.
The deep-sea clade Lokiarchaeota includes genes
shared by an ancestor of the eukaryotes.
Metagenomics reveals uncultured organisms. We continue to discover deeply branching clades of archaea by
designing new PCR primers, reverse-transcribing community rRNA, and sequencing metagenomes.

19.2

Archaeal membranes are composed of L-glycerol
diether or tetraether lipids, with isoprenoid side chains
that may include cross-links or pentacyclic rings.
Many archaea have no peptidoglycan cell wall, but an
S-layer of protein. Some methanogens have cell walls of
pseudomurein.

Crenarchaeota across
the Temperature Range

How were the first crenarchaeotes discovered and
described? The name Crenarchaeota means “scalloped
archaea,” derived from the amorphous scalloped cell shapes
of the first hyperthermophiles discovered. The first members described were hyperthermophiles such as Thermosphaera species (see Table 19.2). Since their discovery,
however, numerous mesophiles and psychrophiles have
been identified in soil and marine habitats.

Habitats for Thermophiles

Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles commonly grow
in hot springs and geysers, such as those of Yellowstone
National Park (Fig. 19.7) or the Solfatara volcanic area
near Naples, Italy. A hot spring occurs where water seeps
underground above a magma chamber, which heats the
water to near boiling. The heated water expands and is

Reduced minerals. The heated water dissolves high

When the water emerges and cools, the minerals precipitate. These reduced minerals serve as rich energy sources
for autotrophs.

Low oxygen content. At higher temperatures, the oxygen concentration of water declines. Therefore, hyperthermophiles tend to be anaerobic, although there are
important exceptions, such as the aerobic sulfur oxidizer
Sulfolobus.

Steep temperature gradients. The temperature of the
water falls dramatically within a short distance from the
source, forming a steep gradient. Different species of

under several kilometers of ocean. Pressure increases by
approximately 100 atm per kilometer of ocean depth.
Organisms that grow only at high pressure are called barophiles (discussed in Chapter 5).

Desulfurococcales: Reducing
Sulfur from Hot Springs

Species of the order Desulfurococcales show distinctive
cell structures and forms of metabolism (Table 19.3). All
possess elaborate S-layers but lack a cell wall; their diphytanylglycerol membranes contain a combination of diethers
and tetraethers. Many take advantage of the high temperatures that increase the thermodynamic favorability of sulfur
redox reactions. An example is Desulfurococcus fermentans
(Fig. 19.8A), a flagellated coccoid cell isolated from hot
springs; it grows optimally at 85°C. D. fermentans respires
anaerobically by reducing elemental sulfur (S0) to sulfide
(HS –). Sulfur reduction is coupled to oxidation of small
organic molecules such as sugars.

A.

Acidity. Some hot-spring environments show extreme
acidity. The acidity results from oxidation of sulfur or
iron in reactions that generate strong inorganic acids
such as sulfuric acid (H 2SO4).

A special subcategory of volcanic hot-spring habitats is
that of submarine hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor.
The vent thermophiles must evolve to grow at high pressure

forced upward through fissures, coming out in a heated
spring. In a geyser, the water is heated under pressure.
As the water escapes upward, it turns into steam, which
expands and jets upward, falling into a heated pool. These
heated pools and their surrounding edges generate extreme
ranges of temperature, mineral content, and acidity. They
support a diverse range of microbial life, including thermophilic cyanobacteria and firmicutes, as well as archaea.
Several features of hot springs and geysers are important

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

Another flagellated coccus, Ignicoccus islandicus, has
an unusual cell architecture (Fig. 19.8B). Ignicoccus has
an outer membrane surrounding its cytoplasmic membrane, with a large aqueous compartment between them.
This outer compartment contains membrane-enclosed vesicles of unknown function. The evolution of this compartment, similar to the extra membranes of the bacterial genus
Planctomyces (see Chapter 18), suggests a model for an
intermediate stage of evolution of the eukaryotic nucleus.
I. islandicus, unlike Desulfurococcus, is a marine organism,
growing at temperatures as high as 98°C. It is a lithotroph,
oxidizing hydrogen with sulfur:

Most of the cultured species of Desulfurococcales are
obligate anaerobes. An exception is Aeropyrum pernix, one
of the first archaea to have its genome sequenced. A. pernix is an aerobic heterotroph, respiring with O2 on complex
compounds during growth at 70°C–100°C.

Barophilic Vent Hyperthermophiles

The most extreme hyperthermophiles are barophiles
adapted to grow near hydrothermal vents at the ocean
floor. The high pressure beneath several kilometers of
ocean allows water to remain liquid at temperatures above
100°C; the highest known temperature for growth of an
organism is 121°C.
A common feature of thermal vents is the black smoker
(Fig. 19.9). A black smoker is a chimney-like structure
resulting from the upwelling of seawater superheated by an
undersea magma chamber. As in a geyser above ground,
the heated water is forced upward through a small opening.
Because the thermal vent is under steam pressure, the water
can reach temperatures of over 400°C, enabling it to dissolve
high concentrations of minerals such as iron II sulfide (FeS).
When the rising water escapes, however, it immediately cools,
depositing iron sulfide around the edge of the vent chimney
and precipitating iron sulfide particles that cloud the water—
hence the term “black smoker.” While no organism can grow
at 400°C, various species of archaea are adapted to grow in
the range of 100°C–120°C, where the vent stream meets the
seawater and minerals precipitate (Fig. 19.9B).
How do we study organisms under such extreme conditions? To study hyperthermophiles from black smoker vents
requires specialized equipment. The isolation of such organisms is a challenge because their habitats endanger our own
survival. Undersea vent systems must be approached by a
special submersible device with a robotic arm. An example is the Environmental Sample Processor from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (Fig. 19.10A).
The robotic system samples temperature and other properties of fluid emerging from a black smoker hydrothermal

Jupiter’s moons, Europa, considered a possible source of extraterrestrial life.
Organisms that do survive transport
to sea level must nonetheless be maintained at high pressure and temperature
to ensure viability. In the laboratory, all
devices for microscopy and cultivation
must be kept under pressure and at high
temperature. Organisms are cultured in a
pressurized cell such as the “Deep Aquarium” (Fig. 19.10B). The culture must be
provided with reduced minerals and gases
needed for the growth of vent microbes.
Vent-adapted crenarchaeotes include
Pyrodictium abyssi (Fig. 19.11), P. occultum, and P. brockii; the latter is named
for Thomas Brock of the University of
Wisconsin–Madison, a pioneering researcher of hyperthermophiles. For energy, Pyrodictium species reduce sulfur to
H 2S, either with molecular hydrogen or with organic compounds. A membrane-embedded sulfur-reducing complex
and a proton-translocating ATP synthase have been isolated from P. abyssi. The complexes are extremely heat stable, exhibiting a temperature optimum of 100°C.
Pyrodictium species grow as flat, disk-shaped cells that
can be as thin as 0.1 µm. The cells contain a periplasm and
outer membrane with an S-layer that is coated with zinc
sulfide, a mineral that precipitates from the vent. The cell
disks are interconnected by glycoprotein tubules called
cannulae (singular, cannula). The cannulae can extend to
more than 0.1 mm, forming complex networks of connections (Fig. 19.11). In liquid culture, the networks grow
into white balls up to 10 mm in diameter. Cryo-electron
tomography of a Pyrodictium cell shows that the cannulae
bridge the periplasm between cells, but not the cytoplasm.
The cannulae may enable Pyrodictium cells to share nutrients and maintain a biofilm, while keeping their cellular
identity distinct with separated cytoplasm.
What happens when a Pyrodictium cell divides? Cells
of P. abyssi generate new cannulae as they undergo fission
(Fig. 19.12). Some of the new cannulae form as loops

Two genera of vent thermophiles have similar names

The intricate cell network of P. abyssi is an example of a
single-species biofilm. Other forms of biofilms are found at
hydrothermal vents. Thermosphaera aggregans forms colonies so tightly bound that they cannot be dissociated by
protease treatment or sonication (Fig. 19.13). Multispecies biofilms of hyperthermophiles line the chimneys of

Can some archaea grow in extreme acid, as well as high

of reducing it as Desulfurococcus does). These organisms,
such as Sulfolobus species, grow at 80°C–90°C within hot
springs and solfataras (volcanic vents that emit only gases).

As a result of sulfuric acid production, the pH of the
organism’s surroundings falls to pH 2–3, effectively excluding all but acidophiles. While other archaea grow at higher
temperatures (up to 120°C) or lower pH (below pH 0), Sulfolobus is of interest as a “double extremophile,” requiring
both high temperature and extreme acidity simultaneously.
Sulfolobus cells have a membrane composed mainly of
tetraethers with cyclopentane rings (see Fig. 19.2E). Tetraether membranes are commonly seen in acidophilic
thermophiles, probably because they are exceptionally
impermeable to protons. Remarkably, Sulfolobus has no
cell wall, but only an S-layer of glycoprotein (Fig. 19.15A;
also see Fig. 19.3A). Like all archaea, these organisms are
nonpathogenic to animals, yet they secrete toxins deadly to
competitor strains of Sulfolobus.
Sulfolobus species are not obligate autotrophs; they can
also grow heterotrophically on sugars or amino acids. In
fact, many species are easily cultured in tryptone broth at
80°C, pH 3. Their internal pH is typically pH 6.5; thus,
they maintain more than three units of pH difference
across their membrane. The full metabolic potential of this
organism is revealed by annotation of its genome, which
contains homologs of sugar and amino acid transporters,
as well as the non-ATP-forming Entner-Doudoroff pathway of glucose catabolism. Genes are present for enzymes

DNA; for example, S. solfataricus and
S. acidocaldarius each use three active
replication origins. The presence of multiple origins is yet another feature of
archaeal DNA management that resembles that of eukaryotes.
Another interesting discovery in Sulfolobus was that of archaeal viruses.

for virus particles to persist at high temperature. In 2012,
however, a possible archaeal RNA-dependent RNA transcriptase (discussed in Chapter 11) was identified from a
Yellowstone hot spring. This finding suggests that there
may exist positive-strand RNA viruses that infect hyperthermophilic archaea.
Thought Question

19.5 What hypotheses might be proposed about archaeal

evolution if viruses of mesophilic archaea are found to have
RNA genomes? What if, instead, all archaeal viruses have DNA
genomes only?

Besides Sulfolobales, the class Thermoprotei includes
other orders of thermoacidophiles. Caldisphaerales is an
order of thermoacidophiles first isolated from a Philippine
hot spring at Mount Makiling. Members of Caldisphaerales, such as Caldisphaera, typically grow at pH 3 up to
80°C. Unlike Sulfolobus species, Caldisphaera species are

anaerobes or microaerophiles, tolerating only low concentrations of oxygen. They grow by fermentation or anaerobic respiration. Another order, Thermoproteales, includes
hyperthermoacidophiles isolated from marine vents; thus,
they survive extreme pressure, as well as heat and acid!
Thermoproteus species grow at temperatures up to 97°C
and at pH values lower than pH 3. Their rod-shaped cells
are less than 0.3 µm in length—one of the smallest cell
types known. Their metabolism is autotrophic, gaining
energy by reducing sulfur with H 2 to H 2S.

Mesophilic Crenarchaeota

Because archaea were first isolated from extreme habitats,
it came as a surprise when SSU rRNA probes revealed
crenarchaeotes in moderate habitats throughout the biosphere. The mesophiles may have evolved from hyperthermophiles by gene acquisition from mesophilic bacteria (see
Section 19.1). Today, many crenarchaeotes—perhaps the
majority, in nature—grow in water or soil, or in association with plants; for example, Figure 19.17 shows crenarchaeotes growing on the surface of a tomato root.
Others are marine mesophiles. The first marine mesophiles were found in 1992 by Edward DeLong and colleagues in samples from the Pacific Ocean (Fig. 19.18A).
A survey in 2001 of marine archaea at the Hawaii Ocean
Time-series Station found high numbers of crenarchaeotes
(Fig. 19.18B). The abundance of crenarchaeotes varied according to season and increased with depth, typically comprising 40% of the total microbial population
at depths of 1,000 meters, where temperatures are cold.

Crenarchaeote species are found in a wide range of
extreme and moderate habitats.

ARCHAEAL DIVERSITY

Habitats for hyperthermophiles include hot springs
and submarine hydrothermal vents. Vent organisms are
barophiles as well as thermophiles. Anaerobic hyperthermophilic acidophiles include Caldisphaerales and
Thermoproteales.
Desulfurococcales includes diverse thermophiles.
Most are anaerobes that use sulfur to oxidize hydrogen
or organic molecules.
Pyrodictium species are disk-shaped cells interconnected
by cytoplasmic bridges called cannulae.

Sulfolobus species oxidize sulfur or H 2S to sulfuric acid,
and they catabolize organic compounds.

Oceans, soil, plant roots, and animals provide habitats for mesophilic and psychrophilic crenarchaeotes.
Psychrophilic crenarchaeotes in marine sediment play
a key role in recycling methane hydrates produced by
methanogens.

The first mesophilic crenarchaeotes were identified by the
sequence of their SSU rRNA. But more recent analysis
combined the sequences of multiple genes, such as those
encoding ribosomal proteins. This more finely tuned
analysis showed that some of the organisms, the Marine
Group I Crenarchaeota, branched deeply from the rest.
These deep-branching archaea were reclassified as a new
clade, the Thaumarchaeota. Thaumarchaeotes synthesize a
distinctive tetraether lipid called crenarchaeol, containing

Psychrophilic Crenarchaeota

Genetic surveys also reveal crenarchaeotes that are
psychrophiles—species adapted to low temperatures. Alison Murray and colleagues from the Desert Research Institute found crenarchaeotes growing in sea ice off Antarctica
(Fig. 19.19). Organisms were collected from ice and seawater at a temperature of –1.8°C; the water remains liquid
below zero because of the high salt concentration. Other
crenarchaeotes are adapted to high pressure as well as cold.
At the ocean floor, at temperatures of about 2°C, benthic
strata show crenarchaeotes that include anaerobic heterotrophs, sulfate reducers, and anaerobic methanotrophs
(methane oxidizers). Methanotrophs are particularly crucial in recycling the methane produced by seafloor methanogens (euryarchaeotes, discussed in Section 19.4).
Another source of psychrophilic archaea is Ace Lake,
Antarctica, a well-studied cold, high-salt habitat with temperatures in the range of 14°C–24°C and bottom anoxic
layers never warmer than 2°C. Ace Lake supports crenarchaeotes, as well as euryarchaeotes such as methanogens
(discussed in Section 19.4).

Ammonia-Oxidizing Thaumarchaeotes
Cycle Global Nitrogen

From a global standpoint, the most significant thaumarchaeotes discovered are the ammonia-oxidizing archaea
(AOA), such as those of the order Nitrosopumilales.
Ammonia-oxidizing archaea gain energy by aerobically oxidizing ammonia to nitrite:
2NH3 + 3O2 ⎯→ 2NO2 – + 2H 2O + 2H+
This lithotrophic reaction yields redox energy, enabling the
microbe to fix CO2 for biomass (discussed in Chapter 14).
In marine environments, excreted ammonia can build up
to high levels, until it is oxidized by archaea and bacteria.
In some habitats, the Thaumarchaeota perform most of the
recycling of ammonia, such as the ammonia excreted by
fish in your aquarium. The thaumarchaeotes thus help balance the ecology of intertidal pools and beaches. The reaction plays a key role in the global nitrogen cycle, as the
first step of returning organic nitrogen to atmospheric N2
(discussed in Chapters 21 and 22). It also provides a major
source of nitrite for marine phytoplankton.
Habitats for free-living ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA).

Ammonia-oxidizing archaea are found in marine environments, such as the seafloor of Tanoura Bay, Japan
(Fig. 19.21). Tatsunori Nakagawa and colleagues at Nihon
University, Japan, used enrichment culture (described in
Chapter 4) to hunt for new kinds of AOA. Samples of sand
from the seafloor were serially diluted in medium containing
ammonium sulfate and adjusted to pH 8, a pH high enough
for significant deprotonation of ammonium ion (NH4+) to
ammonia (NH3). During the enrichment culture, ammonia was progressively consumed and converted to nitrite
(NO2–). In the culture, the gene encoding ammonia oxidase
(amoA) was identified by PCR amplification. The ammoniaoxidizing archaea (AOA) were identified by fluorescence in

situ hybridization (FISH) using a fluorophore attached to
DNA that hybridizes to rRNA of Nitrosopumilus species.
The best-studied ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeote,
Nitrosopumilus maritimus, was isolated from a marine
aquarium in 2005 by David Stahl and colleagues at the
University of Washington, Seattle. Nitrosopumilus and
related AOA oxidize ammonia at extremely low concentrations. Thus, AOA quickly remove a substance toxic to fish.
AOA have since been found throughout marine and freshwater communities, as well as in soil, where they perform
the important function of ammonia removal. They appear
in industrial waste sludge, revealed by fluorescent DNA
probes (Fig. 19.22). While bacteria also oxidize ammonia, in many habitats the AOA are the dominant oxidizers.
Ammonia-oxidizing thaumarchaeotes continue to be discovered in other habitats, including Antarctic lakes down
to temperatures of –20°C.
Symbiotic ammonia-oxidizing archaea. Are AOA found

on humans? Christine Moissl-Eichinger discovered AOA in
the microbiome of human skin, where they are the major
archaeal component of the skin microbiome. The human
body continually emits ammonia, so AOA may help metabolize this toxic substance while controlling skin pH for the
microbial community. The finding of ammonia-oxidizing
thaumarchaeotes on the skin, as well as methanogens in the
gut, may help explain another discovery made by MoisslEichinger—namely, the DNA signatures of thaumarchaeotes
and methanogens in hospital intensive care units and industrial clean-room facilities.
In the deep ocean, some of the psychrophilic
thaumarchaeotes found by DeLong and colleagues live
as endosymbionts of marine animals such as the sponge.
The thaumarchaeote Cenarchaeum symbiosum inhabits
the sponge Axinella mexicana (Fig. 19.23A). Like other

A third major branch of known archaea is Euryarchaeota,
the “broad-ranging archaea” (see Table 19.2). The euryarchaeotes include several independent branches of methanogens, species that derive energy through reactions
producing methane. Methanogens release methane from
soil and animal digestive habitats throughout Earth. For
the methanogen, methane is just a by-product of its energyyielding metabolism, but this by-product is a greenhouse

gas with profound consequences for our biosphere (discussed in Chapter 22).
The phylogeny of Figure 19.6 shows how clades of
methanogens branch deeply, as diverse as all the euryarchaeotes together. Two possible explanations of this phylogeny would be (1) the ancestral euryarchaeote was a
methanogen, but many descendant lineages lost the metabolism; or (2) divergent euryarchaeotes acquired the genes
for methanogenesis later, independently by gene transfer. As yet, we lack sufficient genomic data to determine
which model is correct. Furthermore, methanogenesis now
appears in one deep-branching clade outside the Euryarchaeota, now called the Bathyarchaeota (formerly the Miscellaneous Crenarchaeota Group).

Biogenic Paths to Methane

Biogenic methane formation has actually been observed
since 1776, when the Italian priest Carlo Campi and physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827) investigated bubbles of
“combustible air” from a wetland lake. Volta wrote:
Being in a little boat on Lake Maggiore, and passing
close to an area covered with reeds, I started to poke
and stir the bottom with my cane. So much air emerged
that I decided to collect a quantity in a large glass container. . . . This air burns with a beautiful blue flame.
Volta noted that methane arose from wetlands containing water-saturated decaying plant material. In 1882, the
German medical researcher Hermann von Tappeiner (1847–
1927) combined plant materials with ruminant stomach
contents (a source of methanogens) and showed that both
components were essential to produce methane. During the
late nineteenth century, in England, methane was collected
from manure and sewage and used as a fuel for street lamps.
Different species generate methane from different substrates, such as CO2 and H 2 or small organic compounds,
generally fermentation products of bacteria. Each pathway
of methanogenesis generates a small free energy change
(ΔG°′) that is just enough to drive processes of carbon fixation and biosynthesis. All types of methanogenesis are poisoned by molecular oxygen and therefore require extreme
anaerobiosis. Major substrates and reactions include:
Carbon dioxide: CO2 + 4H2 ⎯→ CH4 + 2H2O
Formic acid: 4CHOOH ⎯→ CH4 + 3CO2 + 2H2O
Acetic acid: CH3COOH ⎯→ CH4 + CO2
Methanol: 4CH3OH ⎯→ 3CH4 + CO2 + 2H2O
Methylamine: 4CH3NH2 + 2H2O ⎯→
3CH4 + CO2 + 4NH3
Dimethyl sulfide: 2(CH3)2S + 2H2O ⎯→
3CH4 + CO2 + 2H2S

In CO2 reduction, the most common form of methanogenesis, carbon dioxide plus molecular hydrogen combine
to form water and methane. CO2-reducing methanogens are autotrophs, growing solely on CO2 and H 2 with
a source of nitrogen and other minerals. Methanogenesis
from other carbon sources, such as formate, acetate, or
methanol, is heterotrophic and generates CO2 as a product
in addition to methane. The nitrogen-containing substrate
methylamine generates ammonia in addition to methane
and CO2, whereas the sulfur-containing substrate dimethyl
sulfide generates hydrogen sulfide.
Note that only a narrow range of substrates supports
methanogenesis. For unknown reasons, most methanogens lack the vast array of energy-yielding pathways found
in soil bacteria such as Rhodopseudomonas or Streptomyces. Thus, methanogens generally require close association with bacterial partners to provide their substrates—a
relationship called syntrophy (discussed in Chapter 14).
Syntrophic methanogens usually grow in habitats with
minimal resource flux, where hydrogen and carbon dioxide
gases can be trapped for their use. Removal of these gases
then enhances bacterial metabolism.
Many kinds of methanogens can be cultured in the laboratory. Their culture poses special challenges because the
reactions of methanogenesis are halted by oxygen. Thus,
most methanogens are strict anaerobes, although a few
that tolerate oxygen have been found. To exclude oxygen,
all growth and manipulation of cultures are performed in
an anaerobic chamber. Furthermore, methanogens that
use CO2 and H 2 as substrates must receive a steady supply of these gases. Even more challenging is the culture of
hyperthermophilic methanogens, such as Methanopyrus, a
deep-ocean vent hyperthermophile that grows at scorching
temperatures up to 122°C. For these organisms, we must
maintain both high temperature and high pressure.
Methanogens include at least four classes, of which five
major orders are shown in Table 19.4. The amount of
divergence within an order can be nearly as great as that
between orders. Particularly striking is the wide range
of growth temperatures among closely related species.
Thermophiles and even hyperthermophiles branch from
closely related mesophiles; for example, the order Methanobacteriales includes Methanobrevibacter ruminantium
(37°C–39°C), Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum
(50°C–75°C), and Methanothermus fervidus (60°C–97°C).

Methanogens Show Diverse Cell Forms

Despite their metabolic similarity, methanogens display
an astonishing diversity of form, perhaps as diverse as
the entire domain of bacteria (Fig. 19.24). For example,

and Methanococcus have protein-derived cell walls.
Filamentous methanogens form chains of large cells
similar to those of filamentous cyanobacteria. Filamentous
methanogens, such as Methanosaeta, perform a key function in the treatment of sewage waste (Fig. 19.25). In
waste treatment, the raw sewage first undergoes aerobic
respiration by bacteria, converting the organic materials to
small molecules such as CO2 and acetate, and then anaerobic digestion of the remainder. The bacteria performing
anaerobic decomposition become trapped in filaments of
Methanosaeta, which convert bacterial fermentation products such as acetate into methane and CO2. The methanogenic filaments serve a key function by trapping bacteria
into granules that settle out from the liquid.

The wetlands that generate the most methane are typically

convert to the substrates used by methanogens. From the
standpoint of the organism, methane is an incidental byproduct, but this product has great significance for our biosphere as a greenhouse gas (discussed in Chapter 22).

found that one way to decrease methane production is to
drain the soils used for rice production. Changsheng Li and
colleagues at the University of New Hampshire showed in
experimental plots that drained soil produces less methane. The drained soil receives more oxygen, which blocks
methanogenesis. Draining soil also stimulates rice root
development and accelerates decomposition of organic matter in the soil to release nitrogen. Sufficiently dry rice paddy
soil can actually become a sink for atmospheric methane,
thanks to methane-oxidizing bacteria.
Another major source of methanogens is landfills. Landfills such as those outside New York City are among the
largest human-made structures on Earth. They are rich in
organic wastes, which bacteria ferment to CO2, H2, and
short-chain organic molecules that methanogens convert to
methane. As a result, large amounts of gas can build up and
spontaneously combust, causing explosions. To avoid explosions, the methane needs to be piped out. In some cases, the
gas can be collected and used to generate electricity.
As global temperatures increase, the largest release of
methane may come from the polar regions, where permafrost thaws and glaciers retreat. In Canada and Alaska, many
lakes and melting permafrost soils produce methane so fast
that one can ignite a flame (Fig. 19.27). In Antarctica, scientists such as Ricardo Cavicchioli from the University of
New South Wales, Australia, have discovered psychrophilic

methanogens (Fig. 19.28). The near-freezing water of Ace
Lake is saturated with methane from methanogens present at high numbers. Cavicchioli showed that the Ace Lake
methanogens have membrane lipids with many double
bonds; the unsaturated form allows more fluidity at low
temperature (see Chapter 3).
Rising temperatures accelerate methanogenesis, and the
methane bubbles up so fast that it melts holes in the ice sheets
covering Arctic lakes. In 2012, Andrew McDougall and
colleagues at the University of Victoria, British Columbia,
modeled the permafrost carbon release and its feedback
effect on global warming. They project that permafrost
could release more than a quarter of its carbon stores by the
year 2100, and that this amount could add another 1.5°C
to the global temperature by the year 2300.

SEBASTIAN KAULITZK/123RF

If our gut is full of methanogens, what are they doing there? Do
they just pass through, picking up hydrogen and CO2 along the
way; or do they interact specifically with their host, and with
their neighboring microbes in the gut microbiome? Elizabeth
Hansen and colleagues at Washington University in St. Louis
set out to address these questions. They selected a well-studied gut methanogen, Methanobrevibacter smithii (Fig. 1). M.
smithii can be cultured inside the cecum (entrance to the large
intestine) of a germ-free mouse. When cultured in the mouse,
the archaeal cell forms a thick capsule of polysaccharide. By

contrast, M. smithii cultured in a batch fermentor forms cells
whose capsule is very thin. This difference suggests that capsule formation is a response to the animal host.
Hansen asked, does the existence of methanogens depend
on the genetic identity of the specific host? This question is
of interest because only some humans release methane, while
others do not; thus, we infer that only some of us are colonized by methanogens. We do not know whether this difference arises from host genetics or from environmental factors.
So, Hansen conducted a study comparing the methanogen
prevalence between pairs of monozygotic twins (identical
twins, from the same fertilized egg) and dizygotic twins (fraternal twins, from two different zygotes) (Fig. 2). Methanogen
prevalence was measured by quantitative PCR amplification (qPCR) of the signature gene mcrA. The gene encodes
methyl-coenzyme M reductase, the enzyme that converts
methyl-coenzyme M (CH3–S-CoM) and thiol-coenzyme B
(HS-CoB) to methane and the CoM-CoB disulfide (CoM-SS-CoB) (shown in Fig. 19.31B). A remarkably high correlation
was found between the methanogen levels of the monozygotic twin pairs. The dizygotic twin pairs, however, showed no
significant correlation. This finding suggests that methanogens are highly sensitive to the host molecular biology.
Hansen then asked whether the presence of methanogens
depends on specific bacterial members of the gut microbiome.
The researchers sequenced metagenomes (sets of partial
genomes from a microbial community; presented in Chapter 21). From the metagenomes, 22 partial bacterial genomes
were assembled that showed significant correlation with
the presence of M. smithii. Remarkably, 20 of the 22 partial

Methane hydrates on the seafloor. Psychrophilic marine

Digestive methanogenic symbionts. Numerous methan-

methanogens grow at or beneath the seafloor. These seabed methanogens generate large volumes of methane that
seep up slowly from the sediment. Under the great pressure
of the deep ocean, the methane becomes trapped as methane gas hydrates, which are crystalline materials in which
methane molecules are surrounded by a cage of water molecules. The methane hydrates accumulate in vast quantities. Methane hydrates are of interest as a potential source
of natural gas. But if a large part of this methane were to
be released, it could greatly accelerate global warming (discussed in Chapter 22).
Fortunately, much of the methane produced by seafloor
methanogens is oxidized to CO2 by anaerobic methane
oxidizers (ANME). The ANME euryarchaeotes oxidize
methane in syntrophy with sulfur-reducing bacteria such
as Desulfurococcus (discussed in Chapter 18). The bacteria
reduce sulfate (abundant in seawater) to sulfide. Coupled
together, the reactions of methane oxidation and sulfate
reduction have the negative value of ΔG needed to drive
metabolism for both kinds of organisms.

ogens also grow within the digestive fermentation chambers of animals such as termites and cattle (Fig. 19.29A)
(discussed in Chapter 21). Termites have to aerate their
mounds continually in order to remove methane; when
rainfall temporarily clogs the mound, the mound can be
ignited by lightning and explode. Cattle support methanogenesis within their rumen and reticulum (a common veterinary trick is to insert a tube into the rumen and ignite
the escaping methane gas). Bovine methanogenesis diverts
carbon from meat production, and it makes a significant
contribution to global methane.
Research on rumen microbiology focuses on attempts
to suppress growth of methanogens. For example, Steven
Ragsdale and his graduate student Bree DeMontigny at
the University of Nebraska–Lincoln tested potential chemical inhibitors of methanogenesis on samples of rumen fluid
(Fig. 19.29B). The rumen fluid was maintained in vials that
serve as artificial rumens. The artificial rumens allow researchers to assess how well the proposed methane-blocking compounds might perform in an actual bovine rumen.

genomes were assigned to the order Clostridiales. This is the
first such specific methanogen-bacterial correlation to be shown
across multiple human host metagenomes. The basis of the connection is not known, but Hansen speculates that specific methanogens couple with specific clostridia-like bacteria to provide the
hydrogen gas needed for methanogenesis. In effect, methanogens
may bring preferred “dinner guests” to the intestinal buffet.

Similar experiments have now been performed testing the colonization requirements of other gut methanogens, such as Methanomassiliicoccus species. How do the results differ, and why?

they affect the caloric content we obtain from food? Experiments with gnotobiotic mice test the interactions between
methanogens and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, an anaerobic
bacterium that ferments complex polysaccharides from plant
foods. The mice were colonized in the presence or absence
of Methanobrevibacter smithii, which consumes H2 through
methanogenesis. Mice colonized with both B. thetaiotaomicron and M. smithii were found to make more fat after consuming the same quantity of food than those colonized solely
with B. thetaiotaomicron. Following up this result, a study of
humans found a correlation between methane breath release
and obesity. Thus, methanogenesis may somehow interact
with human gut bacterial digestion to increase the efficiency
of fat storage. How the composition of intestinal microbiota
may influence obesity is discussed in Section 23.2.

Biochemistry of Methanogenesis

Methanogenesis is extremely important for our environment
because the process releases a potent greenhouse gas. Thus,
much effort goes into better understanding how methanogenesis works. Knowledge of methanogenic biochemistry
may help us develop controls, such as methanogen-specific
antibiotics to minimize methane output from cattle.
Cofactors for methanogenesis. The process of methan-

ogenesis uses a series of specific cofactors to carry each
carbon from CO2 (or other substrates) as it becomes progressively reduced by hydrogen. The hydrogen atoms also
require redox carriers. Most of the cofactors are unique
to methanogens, although the general structural types
resemble those of redox cofactors we saw in Chapter 14
(Fig. 19.30). For example, cofactor F420 is a heteroaromatic molecule (containing nitrogens in the aromatic rings)
that undergoes a redox transition by acquiring or releasing
two hydrogens (Fig. 19.30C)—a transition similar to that
of the nicotinamide ring of NADH.

Methanogenesis from CO2 . The for-

mation of methane from CO2 and H 2
(Fig. 19.31) is technically a form of
anaerobic respiration in which H 2 is the
CH2
O
electron donor and CO2 is the terminal
P O CH
electron acceptor (discussed in ChapOH
CO2H
ter 14). The process fi xes CO2 onto the
cofactor methanofuran (MFR) and then
passes the carbon stepwise from one
cofactor to the next, each time losing an oxygen to form
water or gaining a hydrogen carried by another cofactor.
The first step in the conversion of CO2 and H 2 to
methane is fixing the carbon onto methanofuran (for its
chemical formula, see Fig. 19.30A). This requires placement of protons onto the oxygen to form water. The
mechanism of methanogenesis depends on the available
concentration of H 2. High-H 2 environments, such as oil
wells and sewage sludge, favor genera such as Methanosarcina (Fig. 19.31A). The high H 2 concentration allows
electron donation to CO2 from an electron transport system (ETS). The ETS may provide energy from a sodium
potential (ΔNa+). Most methanogens require Na+ for
growth, unlike bacteria, many of which can grow without sodium. Methanogenesis ultimately generates a Na+
potential that drives ATP synthesis. The sodium requirement of methanogens is something they share with
another division of Euryarchaeota, the halophiles (discussed in Section 19.5).
Other methanogens, such as Methanobacterium
and Methanococcus, use much lower concentrations of
H 2 (<1/10,000 atm) common in soil or water. At lower

concentrations of substrate, the free energy (ΔG) of reaction becomes less favorable (discussed in Chapters 13
and 14). So the methanogen needs to couple CO2 reduction to an energy-spending reaction, the reduction of
CoM-S-S-CoB (Fig. 19.31B). This coupling of an energyspending electron transfer (CO2 reduction via ferredoxin)
to an energy-yielding electron transfer (CoM-S-S-CoB
reduction) is called electron bifurcation. The cost of electron bifurcation (compared to the ETS used with high H 2,
see Fig. 19.31A) is that fewer ATPs can be made; but it
allows many more types of methanogens to grow in a much
wider range of natural habitats.
Later steps in methanogenesis reduce the carbon with
H 2 to methane. In the final step, CoM-S-S-CoB serves as
an anaerobic terminal electron acceptor for an ETS accepting electrons from H 2. Overall, H 2 reduces CoM-S-S-CoB
back to the two cofactors HS-CoM and HS-CoB through
an ETS, generating a proton motive force. The proton
motive force drives ATP synthase.
Another important feature of methanogenesis is that
the enzymes catalyzing each step require several transition
metals. For example, the hydrogenase that reduces F420

the species; some species have two alternative enzymes,
depending on which metal is available. Another metal,
cobalt, is required for a B12-related cofactor that participates
in methane production from methanol and methylamines.

Thought Question

19.7 What do the multiple metal requirements suggest about
how and where the early methanogens evolved?

Methanogenesis from acetate. Methane production from

acetate is particularly important for wastewater treatment,
where most of the substrate consists of short-chain bacterial
fermentation products. The acetate methanogenesis pathway is not fully understood, but the initial incorporation

of H 2 probably requires a coupled gradient of sodium ion,
as it does for CO2 methanogenesis. The two carbons from
acetate enter different pathways, which eventually converge:

Methanogens gain energy through redox reactions
that generate methane from CO2 and H 2, formate, and
acetate. They require association with bacterial species
that generate the needed substrates.
Methanogens have rigid cell walls of diverse composition in different species, including pseudopeptidoglycan, protein, and sulfated polysaccharides.
Species of methanogens show a wide range of different shapes, including rods (single or filamentous), cocci
(single or clumped), and spirals.
Methanogens inhabit anaerobic environments such
as wetland soil, marine benthic sediment, and animal
digestive organs.
Biochemical pathways of methanogenesis involve
transfer of the increasingly reduced carbon to cofactors
that are unique to methanogens.

19.5

Halophilic Euryarchaeota

environments are extremely halophilic archaea, members of
the class Haloarchaea. The halophilic archaea require at
least 1.5-M NaCl or equivalent ionic strength, and most
grow optimally at near saturation (about 4.3 M, seven times
the concentration of seawater). Salted foods such as meat
and fish and salt-cured hides can be spoiled by haloarchaea.
Most haloarchaea belong to the order Halobacteriales,
which was named before the archaea were classified as
distinct from bacteria. Halobacteriales includes species of haloarchaea that diverge among the methanogens
(see Fig. 19.6). The halophiles, however, do not conduct
methanogenesis, but grow as photoheterotrophs, using
light energy to drive a retinal-based ion pump to establish a
proton potential. Their photopigments color salterns, brine
pools that are evaporated to mine salt (Fig. 19.33A). The
red pigment bacterioruberin protects cells from damage by
light (Fig. 19.33B).

Haloarchaeal Form and Physiology

Halophilic microbes need a way to maintain turgor
pressure—that is, to avoid cell shrinkage as cytoplasmic
water runs down the osmotic gradient toward external high
salt. Most bacterial halophiles compensate for high external salt by uptake or synthesis of other kinds of osmolytes,
such as small organic molecules. Haloarchaea, however,

High GC content of DNA. High salt concentration
decreases the fidelity in base pairing of DNA. Because
the triple hydrogen bonds of GC pairs hold more
strongly than those of AT pairs, the exceptionally high
GC content of haloarchaea (above 60% for most species)
may protect their DNA from denaturation in high salt.

■

Acidic proteins. Most haloarchaeal proteins are highly
acidic, with an exceptional density of negative charges at
their surface. The high negative charge maintains a layer
of water in the form of hydrated potassium ions (K+).
This unusual hydration layer keeps the acidic proteins
soluble in the high salt within the cytoplasm.

The high salt content of haloarchaea provides a convenient way to lyse cell contents for analysis: Simply transfer cells into low-salt buffer, and they fall apart owing to
osmotic shock. This technique provides a quick way for
beginning students to isolate DNA. This and other techniques have made the organism Halobacterium a model
system for molecular biology education (eTopic 19.1).
The properties of diverse halophiles are presented in
Table 19.5. The haloarchaea are generally uniform with
respect to temperature range (mesophilic). With respect to
pH, some halophiles grow at neutral pH, whereas others
are alkaliphiles, growing in soda lakes above pH 9, such as
Lonar Lake, Maharashtra State, India. The cell envelopes of

most haloarchaea contain rigid cell walls of glycoprotein, as
do some of the methanogens. Most species possess flagella
for phototaxis and gas vesicles for maintaining their buoyancy in the upper layer of the water column. Unlike phospholipid vesicles, gas vesicles are made entirely of protein,
and they are filled with air.
Haloarchaeal gas vesicles earned an unusual grant from
the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Shiladitya DasSarma
at the University of Maryland School of Medicine proposes
to use recombinant gas vesicles of Halobacterium NRC-1
as a delivery vehicle for recombinant vaccines against
typhoid bacteria. The recombinant haloarchaeal vaccine

adapt to high external NaCl by maintaining a high intracellular concentration of potassium chloride (about 4-M KCl).
Potassium ion concentrations are moderately high in most
microbial cells (commonly 200 mM), but the exceptionally
high KCl concentration within haloarchaea requires major
physiological adaptations:

and convenient delivery method for developing countries
where typhoid is widespread.
With respect to cell shape, haloarchaea display considerable diversity. Some species form symmetrical rods, as in
Halobacterium NRC-1. Other species form pleomorphic
cells, flattened like pancakes; and still others form regular
cocci (Haloferax mediterranei) (Fig. 19.35A). A few species grow as flattened squares—the only microbial cells
known to be square (Haloquadratum walsbyi) (Fig. 19.35B
and C). The mechanism that maintains the various shapes is
unknown. In oligotrophic (low-nutrient) environments, it is
likely that the greater surface-to-volume ratio gives flattened
cells a competitive edge in obtaining nutrients.

Different Hypersaline Habitats
Support Different Haloarchaea

Not all hypersaline (high-salt) habitats are alike. They differ with respect to pH, temperature, and the presence of
other minerals, such as magnesium ion. Different kinds
of hypersaline habitats support different species of haloarchaea (see Table 19.5), as well as halophilic bacteria. Major
types of habitats include:
■

Thalassic lakes. Thalassic lakes (from the Greek
thalassa, meaning “ocean”), such as the Great Salt
Lake in Utah, contain saturated salts with essentially
the same ionic proportions as the ocean: Na+ and Cl–
(NaCl) predominate, followed by Mg2+, K+, and SO42–.

■

Athalassic lakes. Athalassic lakes, such as the Dead Sea
in Israel, contain higher proportions of magnesium ions.
These habitats favor genera such as Haloarcula, which
require 100 mM Mg2+ for growth and grow best at
magnesium concentrations above 1 M.

■

Solar salterns. These are artificial pools of brine, or
saturated NaCl, that evaporate in sunlight, precipitating
halite (salt crystals) for commercial production. Commercial
evaporation pools for salt actually benefit from the red
microbes, whose light absorption accelerates heating and
evaporation.

■

Brine pools beneath the ocean. Undersea brine pools
collect near geothermal vents, as in the Gulf of Mexico,
Mediterranean Sea, and Red Sea. These hypersaline
regions contain salts brought up by vent water. They
support hyperthermophilic halophiles, most of which
have not yet been cultured.

■

Alkaline soda lakes, such as Lake Magadi in Kenya,
where carbonate salts drive the pH above pH 9. These lakes
support alkaliphilic haloarchaea such as Halobacterium.

■

Underground salt deposits, which contain micropockets
of salt-saturated water where halophiles may survive for
thousands of years.

Most haloarchaea are photoheterotrophs, in which light-directed energy
acquisition supplements respiration on
complex carbon sources. Respiration
occurs with oxygen or anaerobically
with nitrate. A typical habitat for haloarchaea starts out as a pool with moderate salt content, containing a range of
bacterial and archaeal species with varied tolerance to salt. As the pool evaporates, the salt concentrates, and the
various bacteria die and lyse, releasing
cell components that the haloarchaea
can metabolize. The halophiles supplement their utilization of organic substrate energy by using light-driven ion
pumps.

called bacteriorhodopsin and the chloride pump halorhodopsin (Fig. 19.36 ). (The role of light-driven ion
pumps in phototrophy is discussed in Chapter 14.) The
proton pump bacteriorhodopsin was named to indicate
that it is a prokaryotic version of the better-known eukaryotic retinal rhodopsins; the name was chosen before the
domain Archaea was recognized. The chloride pump
halorhodopsin was discovered and named in reference to
the chloride ion (a halide). The two proteins are homologs with similar structure and mechanism. In the cell
membrane, they form complexes that aggregate in patches
called purple membrane.
Each bacteriorhodopsin proton pump contains seven
alpha helices that traverse the membrane (Fig. 19.36A),
surrounding a buried molecule of retinal, the same
light-absorbing molecule found in photoreceptors of the
human retina. Light absorption triggers a conformational
change that enables a proton from the cytoplasmic face to
be picked up by an aspartate residue. The proton is then
transferred stepwise through several other amino acid
residues in the protein, leading to release of the proton
outside the cell. The net result of proton transfer by bacteriorhodopsin is generation of a proton motive force that

can run a proton-driven ATP synthase, storing energy as
ATP (Fig. 19.36B).
Halorhodopsin has a similar structure, in which chloride
(instead of H+) is pumped into the cell instead of outward.
Because chloride is negatively charged, this chloride transport contributes to the proton motive force. Light-driven
chloride pumps are unique to haloarchaea.
Haloarchaea also possess homologs of bacteriorhodopsin that serve as sensory devices: the sensory rhodopsins I and II. These proteins, too, each have seven alpha
helices containing retinal. When the sensory rhodopsins
absorb light, they signal the cell to swim using its flagella
(discussed in Chapter 3). The activated sensory rhodopsin I directs the cell to swim toward red light, the optimum range for photosynthesis. Sensory rhodopsin II is
activated to reverse the flagellar motor and make the cell
swim away from blue and ultraviolet light, which causes
photooxidative damage to DNA. The rhodopsins signal
through the chemotaxis machinery to the flagellar motor,
using histidine kinase enzymes that phosphorylate regulatory proteins (see Fig. 19.36B). This response to light,
or phototaxis, is an important model for archaeal molecular regulation.

CHAPTER 19

The Halobacterium genome reveals homologs for many
genes that encode transporters of organic food molecules
such as sugars and amino acids. In addition, the genome
contains a number of cation and anion transporter genes.
Some transporters move in needed molecules such as phosphate, whereas others pump out harmful substances such
as arsenate. Efflux of inorganic toxins is particularly critical
for growth in evaporating brine, where the concentrations
of trace metals are increasing.

Haloarchaea are extreme halophiles, growing in at
least 1.5-M NaCl. They are isolated from salt lakes, solar
salterns, underground salt micropockets, and salted
foods.
Haloarchaea show diverse cell shapes, including slender rods (Halobacterium), cocci (Halococcus), and flat
squares (Haloquadratum). The cell envelopes of most
haloarchaea contain rigid cell walls of glycoprotein.
Gas vesicles provide buoyancy, enabling haloarchaea to
remain near the top of the water column.
Molecular adaptations to high salt include DNA of
high GC content and acidic proteins (proteins with a
high number of negatively charged residues).
Retinal-based photoheterotrophy involves the proton pump bacteriorhodopsin or the chloride pump
halorhodopsin. Both pumps contain retinal for light
absorption.

Extremophilic
Euryarchaeota and
Deeply Branching Divisions

Besides the methanogens and halophiles, the phylum
Euryarchaeota includes a number of hyperthermophiles
that superficially resemble the crenarchaeotes, although
their genetic divergence from these organisms is deep.
Some of the euryarchaeotes are acidophiles that grow under
the most extreme acidic conditions on Earth.

Thermococcales

A major group of hyperthermophilic euryarchaeotes is the
order Thermococcales, including genera such as Thermococcus and Pyrococcus (Fig. 19.38A). These genera are most
commonly isolated from submarine solfataras, volcanic
vents that emit only gases. Most are anaerobes fermenting
complex carbon sources, such as peptides or carbohydrates.
Their growth is accelerated by the use of elemental sulfur as
a terminal electron acceptor for anaerobic respiration:
2H+ + 2e – + S0 ⎯→ H 2S
Alternatively, these species can oxidize molecular hydrogen
with sulfur:
H 2 + S0 ⎯→ H 2S

GONZALES ET. AL.EXTREMOPHILES, VOL. 2, ISSUE: 2, MAY 20,

Most Thermococcus and Pyrococcus species grow at temperatures well above 90°C; Pyrococcus woesei, for example,
grows at temperatures as high as 105°C.
Species of Thermococcales are the source of “vent polymerases” for PCR amplification. They now replace the
enzyme Taq polymerase obtained from the Yellowstone
hot-spring bacterium Thermus aquaticus, which grows only
at temperatures up to 90°C. The Taq enzyme has only limited stability at or above 95°C, but DNA polymerases with

and increased accuracy in replication
have been produced from vent-dwelling
archaea such as Pyrococcus furiosus and
Thermococcus litoralis. These vent polymerases now allow higher-temperature
denaturation and synthesis of GC-rich
sequences that were difficult to amplify
with the original thermostable enzyme.

Patrick Forterre, and colleagues at Genoscope, the French
National Sequencing Center. The genome of Pyrococcus
abyssi reveals an especially high number of eukaryotic homologs for DNA replication, transcription, and protein translation. Examples include the eukaryotic-like primase, helicase,
and endonuclease for generation of Okazaki fragments in
the lagging strand of DNA synthesis. At the same time, the
genome also shows bacterial homologs for cell division and
DNA repair. Thus, P. abyssi offers a striking view of mixed
heritage from the common ancestor of the three domains.
Pyrococcus species possess enzymes conducting most of
the classic conversions of the EMP pathway of glycolysis,

but several steps use enzymes unrelated to those in bacteria.
Examples include two ADP-dependent enzymes—
glucokinase and phosphofructokinase—as well as the phosphate-independent enzyme glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
ferredoxin oxidoreductase. The glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate conversion is unique in that it sidesteps the use of
inorganic phosphate, which is required at this step by bacterial glycolysis (shown earlier, in Fig. 19.4).
Pyrococcus and other members of Thermococcales have
enzymes requiring tungsten, a metal rarely required outside the archaea. (Tungsten is present in elevated concentrations at hydrothermal vents.) Another unusual feature of

19.8 Compare and contrast the metabolic options available
for Pyrococcus and for the crenarchaeote Sulfolobus.

Archaeoglobus Partly Reverses
Methanogenesis

While many archaea reduce sulfur, only one group is
known to reduce sulfate ion (SO42–) without a bacterial
partner. The order Archaeoglobales includes Archaeoglobus
fulgidus, a hyperthermophile with unusual metabolic characteristics. Figure 19.38B shows A. fulgidus isolated from
water at 75°C beneath an oil rig in the North Sea.
The genome of A. fulgidus reveals an exceptionally complex array of metabolic pathways, including an acetyl-CoA
degradation pathway that reverses part of methanogenesis
(Fig. 19.39). A. fulgidus, a deep-sea-vent hyperthermophile,
oxidizes methyl groups back to CO2 using the methanogenic cofactor methanopterin (MPT) (see Fig. 19.31A). The
methyl groups are oxidized by reduction of sulfate. Archaeoglobus is the only archaeon known to reduce sulfate without
a bacterial partner. This archaeon may play an important role
in limiting ocean release of methane from methanogens.
A. fulgidus uses several enzymes and cofactors, such as
MPT, present in methanogens. But instead of generating
methane from CO2, they run the reactions in reverse, converting the methyl group of acetate to CO2. The energy
required is gained through fermentation of carbohydrates
and through anaerobic respiration with sulfate. The sulfate
is successively reduced to sulfite and sulfide. When organic
substrates are available, sulfate reduction yields more energy
than methanogenesis.

Thermoplasmatales

The order Thermoplasmatales includes thermophiles and
acidophiles with no cell wall and no S-layer, but only a
plasma membrane. How they maintain their cells against
extreme conditions is poorly understood. An example is the
moderate thermophile isolated from self-heating coal refuse
piles, Thermoplasma acidophilum, growing at 59°C and
pH 2. The cells have flagella and are motile, but it is unclear
how the flagella maintain a torque against the membrane
without a rigid envelope for support. The metabolism of
T. acidophilum, like that of Pyrococcus, is based on S0 respiration of organic molecules.
The genome sequence of T. acidophilum contains just
1.5 million bp—one of the smallest known for a free-living
organism. It shows substantial evidence of horizontal transfer from the crenarchaeote Sulfolobus, a hyperthermophile
that shares the same range of habitats. Horizontal transfer
between distant relatives turns out to be common among
the hyperthermophiles, causing some controversies in their
classification.
Another acidophilic genus of the order Thermoplasmatales is Ferroplasma (Fig. 19.40). Ferroplasma species are
found in mines containing iron pyrite ore (FeS2). Using
dissolved Fe3+ as an oxidizing agent in the presence of
H 2O, they oxidize the sulfur to sulfuric acid. The chemical equation is:
FeS2 + 14Fe3+ + 8H 2O ⎯→ 15Fe2+ + 2SO42– + 16H+
The reaction generates pH values below pH 0 (1-M H+).
This degree of acidity is enough to dissolve a metal shovel
within a day.
The amorphous cells of Ferroplasma acidarmanus grow
in biofilms that form long streamers into water draining
from the mine (Fig. 19.40B). The oxidative disintegration
of iron-bearing ores can be useful for leaching of minerals,
but it also causes acid mine drainage into aquatic systems
(discussed in Chapter 22).

Nanoarchaeota

The smallest known euryarchaeotes are the Nanoarchaeota,
recognized so far for a single species, Nanoarchaeum equitans (Fig. 19.41). The organism consists of exceptionally
small cells that are obligate symbionts of the crenarchaeote
Ignicoccus. The N. equitans cell in Figure 19.41 is attached
to I. hospitalis by a membrane bridge (black arrow). The
host cell may harbor up to four of the smaller cells. Both
host and symbiont genomes have been sequenced, revealing extensive coevolution of the two.
The N. equitans genome is exceptionally small (less than
500 kb) and shows evidence of rapid degenerative evolution. The diminished genome is typical of a dependent
organism that has lost numerous genes for functions now
provided by a host. It remains unclear, however, whether
N. equitans is parasitic on Ignicoccus or if it makes a metabolic contribution to its host (which is able to grow without
the attached N. equitans).

Most deeply branching organisms are uncultivated, and little is known of them other than their rRNA sequence. But
for some organisms, new techniques of genome sequencing
enable us to read most of a genome from a single cell.
An example of a deeply branching division is the Ancient
Archaeal Group (AAG) of hyperthermophiles. AAG
includes the Korarchaeota vent hyperthermophiles isolated
by Susan Barns and Norman Pace. The organisms have not
been isolated in pure culture, but in 2008 the genome of
one korarchaeote was sequenced from an enriched mixed
culture at 80°C–90°C at Obsidian Pool, Yellowstone
National Park. The organism, provisionally named “Candidatus Korarchaeum cryptofilum,” grows in long, thin filaments less than 200 nm wide. Its genes suggest that it gains
energy mainly from anaerobic peptide fermentation, yet we
still do not know enough to culture this organism in the
laboratory.

Crenarchaeotes are found in all soil and water habitats,
and as endosymbionts of marine animals. Archaea show
unique cell structures such as grappling-hook appendages,
and unique forms of metabolism such as methanogenesis. Methanogens colonize all soil and water environments, as well as the human digestive tract. Yet we probably

Why is it interesting to find choanoflagellates in a lake in Antarctica?

In the McMurdo Dry Valleys, perennially ice-covered lakes are the only
source of year-round liquid water for
life. Most of the lake food webs are
microbially dominated and virtually
lack metazoa. Microbial eukaryotes
play important roles as primary producers and consumers. Photosynthetic protists represent
the major producers of organic matter in McMurdo lake ecosystems, while heterotrophic flagellates and ciliates are the
predators of bacteria and smaller protists. In Lake Bonney,
heterotrophic flagellates (such as choanoflagellates) are
major bacterivores and a key component in the food web.
How do you think choanoflagellates resemble the earliest
form of animal life?

Over 600 million years ago, the multicellular ancestor of
modern animals evolved from a unicellular flagellate. The
transition to multicellularity that triggered the evolution
of metazoa from protozoa is a critical question regarding
animal origins. Recent phylogenetic studies indicate that
metazoa are monophyletic and their common ancestor was
shared by single-celled choanoflagellates.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

When we think of eukaryotes, we think first of plants and
animals consisting of complex multicellular bodies. But
eukaryotes also include vast numbers of microbes, such as
protists (algae and protozoa). How did complex animals
such as ourselves evolve from a protist ancestor? Certain
protists called choanoflagellates show remarkable genetic
similarity to animals. Choanoflagellates can be induced
to form a multicellular colony called a rosette (shown in
the Current Research Highlight). The rosette is formed of
interconnected cells and can grow and fission like a unified organism. Both single-celled and rosette choanoflagellates are ubiquitous in marine and freshwater habitats.
Even in the subfreezing lakes of Antarctica, these protists
grow with their hint of life’s ancient transition to metazoa (multicellular animals). Experiments on algae suggest

Phylogeny of
Eukaryotes

With all their diversity, eukaryotic cells share
a common structure defined by the presence
of the nucleus and other membrane-enclosed
organelles (for review, see eAppendix 2). The
extensive compartmentalization of the eukaryotic cell, including the nucleus and endomembrane system, enables eukaryotic cells
to grow a thousandfold larger than prokaryotic cells. Yet these organelles are found
within even the tiniest of eukaryotes, such
as Ostreococcus tauri, a green alga less than
2 μm across (Fig. 20.2). This alga consists of a
flat, disk-shaped cell containing one or two of
each major type of organelle: a mitochondrion,
a chloroplast, and a stack of Golgi, all packed
within the cell’s small volume. The genome of
O. tauri is also downsized; at only 8 Mb, the
genome is barely twice as long as that of the bacterium Escherichia coli. Discovered only recently,
such tiny bacteria-sized eukaryotes are believed
to be the most numerous and ubiquitous forms
of eukaryotic life.
Note that, despite their extraordinary range of
form, the metabolism of eukaryotes is less diverse
than that of either bacteria or archaea. Most
eukaryotes conduct either oxygenic photosynthesis or heterotrophy—or both. All have descended
from an ancestral cell that engulfed a bacterial
endosymbiont, giving rise to mitochondria, the
source of aerobic respiration. And all phototrophs
descended from a cell that engulfed the bacterial
ancestor of chloroplasts.

from animals and plants (Fig. 20.4). In the terminology
used today:
■

Protist refers to single-celled and colonial eukaryotes
other than fungi. Protists include many diverse clades of
algae and protozoa.

■

Protozoa are protists that are single-celled heterotrophs.
They include environmental consumers, as well as medically important parasites such as Giardia.

The algae include two major kinds. Those of the first
kind are derived from a single endosymbiotic event and
are closely related to green plants. These algae are called
primary algae (Viridiplantae in Fig. 20.4). By contrast,
various groups of heterotrophic protists later incorporated
algae in a second event of symbiogenesis. These are secondary algae (green asterisks in Fig. 20.4).

Note:

Medical textbooks also cover invertebrate animal parasites such as worms and mites as eukaryotic agents of disease,
although they are not considered microbes.

Challenges for Classification

Classifying eukaryotes presents a challenge, for several
reasons. Complex eukaryotic cells frequently lose structures through reductive (degenerative) evolution. Thus,

for example, a clade originally defined by possession of flagella often includes members that lack flagella. In addition,
superficially similar forms of organisms have evolved independently in distantly related taxa; this is called convergent
evolution. For example, the “water molds” that grow on
aquarium fish superficially resemble fungi, but they actually
evolved in a clade that includes brown algae and diatoms.
Another challenge for classification is the size and complexity of eukaryotic genomes, which has delayed the
completion of genome sequences. Eukaryotic genomes
are typically severalfold larger than those of bacteria and
archaea, and 50%–90% of their DNA consists of noncoding sequences. Thus, eukaryotic genomes take longer to
sequence and are more challenging to annotate than those
of prokaryotes.
Furthermore, the evolution of eukaryotes includes multiple events of endosymbiosis, in which an engulfed cell
evolved into an essential organelle. An endosymbiotic
incorporation of a proteobacterium by the ancestor of all
eukaryotes gave rise to mitochondria. Later, incorporation
of a cyanobacterium by the ancestor of plants and algae
gave rise to chloroplasts. Much later, several lineages of
protists took up chloroplast-bearing algae, which now show
varying stages of evolution as organelles.
A consensus view of eukaryotic phylogeny (Fig. 20.4)
is based on DNA sequence comparison, protein trees, and

FIGURE 20.5 ■ Alignment of peptide sequences for EF-1 reveals insertion in opisthokont species. A DNA insertion encoding 11–17 amino acid residues appears in the EF-1α sequence of animals, fungi, and microsporidians (known collectively as opisthokonts) but
not in plants or most protists. This finding suggests that opisthokonts have a common ancestor that branched early from the eukaryotes and
diverged later to animals and fungi. Source: Modified from Sandra L. Baldauf. 2003. Science 300:1703.

microbial eukaryotes. For a more extensive table, see
Appendix 2.

Opisthokonts: Animals and Fungi

Where do humans and other multicellular animals fit
into this taxonomy? The position of animals (“metazoa”) among the eukaryotic microbial clades is of interest
because it suggests which contemporary microbes most
closely resemble our own cells. The degree of relatedness
can help define microbial model systems for probing key
questions of human cell biology. For example, the baker’s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae shares so much of its
genetic machinery with humans that it provides a model
for cancer, cell-trafficking defects, and even the basis of
human aging.
As we saw in Chapter 17, the first measure of species relatedness is based on DNA sequences encoding
ribosomal RNA, particularly small-subunit rRNA. For
eukaryotes, however, rRNA sequences yield ambiguous results, in part because of differing rates of change
among different clades. So researchers have searched
the genomes for stronger clues to relative divergence—
that is, which clade diverged earliest from the others.
A particularly strong clue would be the appearance of a
gene insertion or deletion unique to a particular clade.
Such a sequence indicates that all species containing the
gene insertion or deletion must have diverged after their

common ancestor branched from the outgroup (most distantly related taxon).
Surprisingly, genomic analysis relates animals more
closely to fungi (such as yeasts) than to motile microbial eukaryotes (such as paramecia or amebas). The true
fungi, or Eumycota, are heterotrophs, either singlecelled or growing in nonmotile filaments of cells called
hyphae. Nevertheless, animals and fungi share several
key gene insertions and deletions, as discovered by Sandra Baldauf and colleagues. Baldauf focused on a short
sequence insertion in a key gene encoding a protein translation factor, elongation factor 1α (EF-1α) (Fig. 20.5).
The inserted DNA, encoding 12 amino acids, appears
in all sequenced genomes of animals and fungi and is
absent from all plants and most protists. It is present in
organisms, such as microsporidians, that were previously
considered protists but whose genomes now indicate classification under fungi. The EF-1α gene sequence, as well
as several others, supports the grouping of animals and
fungi (including microsporidians) together in one clade
(see Fig. 20.4).
Animal and fungal cells also share a structural feature distinguishing them from protists: the presence of an
unpaired flagellum. Both animals and fungi include species whose life cycle has a uniflagellar stage, in contrast to
other microbial eukaryotes whose flagella are paired (for
example, euglenas). In the case of humans, the uniflagellar
stage is the spermatozoan. Similarly, some species of fungi

generate uniflagellar reproductive cells called zoospores.
As a whole, the clade including single-flagellum members is
termed “opisthokont,” based on the Greek words meaning
“backward-pointing pole,” because the flagellum points
backward like an oar.
Among opisthokonts, the microbes that diverged most
recently from animals (600 million years ago) appear to
be the choanoflagellates. Genetic studies of choanoflagellates reveal several genes found only in animals. The prefix
“choano-” (meaning “funnel”) refers to the collar of filaments surrounding the flagellum. The collared cells of
choanoflagellates closely resemble the choanocyte cells of
colonial sponges, an ancient form of animal (Fig. 20.6).
Furthermore, choanoflagellates form colonies that crudely
resemble the colonial structure of sponges. Thus, choanoflagellates may represent a “missing link” between animals
and the microbial eukaryotes.

Note:

Eukaryotic flagella are whiplike organelles composed
of microtubules and surrounded by a membrane; their action is
powered by ATP along the entire filament. Distinguish them from
bacterial and archaeal flagella, which are rotary helical filaments
composed entirely of protein subunits; their rotation is powered at
the base by proton motive force.

Fungi (Eumycota) consist of cells with chitinous cell
walls that grow in chains called hyphae (singular, hypha).
Fungi range from single-celled organisms, such as yeasts, to
complex multicellular forms such as mushrooms. The deepest-branching clade of fungi, Chytridiomycota, produces
the uniflagellar zoospores that define opisthokonts. Other
fungi, however, generate nonmotile reproductive cells, a
result of reductive evolution.
Several taxa that historically were grouped with fungi
(for example, slime molds) are now classified genetically
as protists. Slime molds generate populations of cells that
migrate into a unified structure called a fruiting body to
make reproductive cells. Slime molds are now grouped with
amebas (Amoebozoa, discussed in Section 20.4). Water
molds, which are plant and animal pathogens of the class
Oomycetes, are now recognized as heterokont protists (see
eTopic 20.1).

Algae Evolved by Engulfing Phototrophs

Algae are commonly defined as single-celled plants and
simple multicellular plants lacking true stems, roots,
and leaves. Algal cells contain chloroplasts, membraneenclosed organelles of photosynthesis that evolved from a

cyanobacterium (Fig. 20.7). In Earth’s biosphere, algae
plus bacterial phototrophs feed all marine and freshwater
ecosystems, producing the majority of oxygen and biomass
available for Earth’s consumers.
How did ancestral algae get their chloroplasts? The
“green plants” (Viridiplantae) include primary algae
descended from a common ancestor containing a chloroplast. The chloroplast evolved by endosymbiosis between an
ancient protist and a cyanobacterium (discussed in Chapter 17). In primary algae, the chloroplast is enclosed by two
membranes (Fig. 20.7A): the inner membrane (from the
ancestral phototroph’s cell membrane) and the outer membrane (from the host cell membrane as it enclosed its prey).
Both green algae (chlorophytes) and red algae (rhodophytes) are primary algae. Their chloroplasts diverged from
their common ancestor to utilize pigments absorbing different ranges of the light spectrum.
Surprisingly, several other taxa traditionally considered to be algae evolved through a secondary endosymbiosis with a second protist host. The symbiotic history of
these secondary algae is most evident in the cryptophytes
(Fig. 20.7B), which still retain a vestigial nucleus, or
nucleomorph, derived from the engulfed alga. In secondary algae, the chloroplast is surrounded by two extra membranes, one from the primary algal cell membrane and one
from the secondary host. Other secondary algae include
the chrysophytes, such as kelps and diatoms. The dinoflagellates, of the protist clade Alveolata, are secondary or
tertiary algae, descended from a flagellate that consumed
one or more types of algae. Dinoflagellates also engage in

“kleptoplasty,” or “chloroplast stealing,” in which the chloroplast of a digested prey is retained long enough to derive
some photosynthetic energy, but ultimately consumed. The
variety of endosymbiosis among protists provides clues as
to how the original chloroplast evolved within the ancestral algae.

Note:

“Algae” may refer to primary algae, or “true algae,” as
well as secondary algae that derive from protist clades. Fungi (the
“true fungi,” or Eumycota) are opisthokonts. Several fungus-like
organisms have been reclassified within protist clades.

Protists Include Many Divergent Clades

The protists actually include several distantly related categories of eukaryotes (see Table 20.1). All protists are
heterotrophs, commonly predators or parasites, although
many also conduct photosynthesis as primary or secondary algae. Protists are important producers and consumers in marine, freshwater, and soil food webs. In ecology,
phototrophic protists are termed “phytoplankton” and
heterotrophs are termed “zooplankton,” although many,
in fact, are “mixotrophs” that act as both producers and
consumers.
Amebas are unicellular organisms of highly variable
shape that form pseudopods, locomotory extensions of
cytoplasm enclosed by the cell membrane. Their size can
reach several millimeters, and they can eat small invertebrates. There are two major groups of amebas: Amoebozoa and Rhizaria (see Table 20.1). The Amoebozoa, the
most familiar kind of amebas, have lobed pseudopods, pseudopods that extend lobes of cytoplasm through cytoplasmic streaming. Most lobed amebas are free-living in aquatic
habitats, but some cause human diseases such as dysentery.
Still other kinds of lobed amebas are cellular slime molds,
in which individual amebas converge to form a fruiting
body. Amebas of the second group, Rhizaria, have thin,

filamentous pseudopods, often radially arranged like a star,
as in heliozoan amebas. Some Rhizaria, such as the foraminiferans, form inorganic shells called tests. Fossil foraminiferan tests are common in rock formations derived from
ancient seas. Foraminiferan shells formed the White Cliffs
of Dover in Britain and the stone used to build the Egyptian pyramids.

single unpaired flagellum (if any). Flagellated heterokonts
possess two flagella of unequal length and different structure. They include many voracious zooplankton. Other heterokonts include the oomycetes, or water molds (formerly
classified with fungi), as well as diatoms and kelps (secondary endosymbiotic algae with chloroplasts). Diatoms are
single cells with unique bipartite shells that fit together like
a petri dish. The shells of diatoms form an infinite variety of different patterns for different species. Kelps, also
known as brown algae, extend multicellular sheets floating
at the water’s surface.
The Discoba include free-living protists such as euglenas,
as well as parasites showing extensive evolutionary reduction. Most Discoba have mitochondria with distinctive
disk-shaped cristae (membrane pockets). Parasitic Discoba
include the trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness and
Chagas’ disease. A related clade, Metamonada, includes the
waterborne parasite Giardia intestinalis (G. lamblia). In
metamonads the mitochondria have lost their genomes and
degenerated into mitosomes (discussed in Section 20.6).

Note:

DNA sequencing led to reclassification of the filamentous amebas as Rhizaria (formerly Cercozoa). “Cercozoa” now
denotes a subgroup under Rhizaria.

Alveolates (Alveolata) include ciliated protists (ciliates), dinoflagellates, and apicomplexans. An example is
the ciliated protist Paramecium (Fig. 20.8A). Alveolates
are known for their complex outer covering, or cortex.
The cortex contains networks of vesicles called cortical
alveoli (Fig. 20.8B). Alveoli store calcium ions, and in
some species protective plates form from them. Organisms
equipped with paired flagella or cilia are known as flagellates and ciliates, respectively. Flagella (singular, flagellum) and cilia (singular, cilium) are essentially equivalent
organelles composed of microtubules and enveloped by
the cell membrane (Fig. 20.8C). Cilia are shorter than
flagella and more numerous, and usually cover a broad
surface. Alveolata also includes a major group of parasites
whose major forms lack flagella, the apicomplexans. A
well-known apicomplexan parasite is Plasmodium falciparum, which causes malaria.
Heterokonts (Heterokonta) are named for their pairs of
differently shaped flagella (see Table 20.1). Heterokonts
are thus distinguished from opisthokonts, which possess a

Emerging Eukaryotes

Are there still eukaryotes that we haven’t yet discovered?
Genes from natural communities continually reveal new
species of microbial eukaryotes in previously unknown
divisions. Many of the new isolates are single cells as small
as bacteria, designated nanoeukaryotes (3–10 μm) and
picoeukaryotes (0.5–3 μm).
Genetic analysis shows that similar miniaturized eukaryotes branch deeply from all groups in the phylogenetic tree,

taxa. Furthermore, our metagenomic analysis reveals eukaryotes in environments previously believed to be restricted to
bacteria and archaea, such as anaerobic submarine sediments,
and the hyperacidic Tinto River in Spain. In every new habitat tested, new deep-branching clades of eukaryotes emerge,
with new implications for ecology and global cycling (discussed in Chapters 21 and 22). The wealth of new genomic
data is reshaping our understanding of the domain Eukarya.

filaments called mycorrhizae extend the root systems of
most plants, forming a nutritional “internet” that interconnects the plant community (discussed in Chapter 21).
Mycorrhizae may have inspired the fictional underground
tree network depicted in the film Avatar (2009).
Within the ruminant digestive tract, fungi ferment plant
materials. On the other hand, pathogenic fungi infect
plants and animals, and they contribute to the death of
immunocompromised human patients. Still other fungi
produce antibiotics such as penicillin, as well as food products such as wine and cheeses (discussed in Chapter 16).

Opisthokonta includes true fungi (Eumycota) and multicellular animals (Metazoa), as well as certain kinds of
protists.

Shared Traits of Fungi

Viridiplantae includes green plants and primary algae.

■

Protist groups include Amoebozoa, the unshelled amebas with lobe-shaped pseudopods; Rhizaria, the filopodial amebas; Alveolata, ciliates and flagellates with
complex cortical structure; Heterokonta, the kelps, diatoms, and flagellates with nonequivalent paired flagella;
and Discoba and Metamonada, primarily parasites.

Absorptive nutrition. Most fungi cannot ingest particulate food, as do protists, because their cell walls cannot
part and re-form, as do the flexible pellicles of amebas
and ciliates. Instead they secrete digestive enzymes and
then absorb the broken-down molecules from their
environment.

■

Hyphae. Most fungi grow by extending multinucleate
cell filaments called hyphae (Fig. 20.9A). As a hypha
extends, its nuclei divide mitotically without cell division, generating a multinucleate cell. Later, septa may
form to partition the hypha into cells. Hyphae grow
by cytoplasmic extension and branching. A branched
mass of extending hyphae is called a mycelium (plural,
mycelia).

■

Cell walls contain chitin. Chitin is an acetylated
amino-polysaccharide of immense tensile strength,
stronger than steel (Fig. 20.9B). Its strength derives
from multiple hydrogen bonds between fibers. Chitinous cell walls enable fungi to penetrate plant or animal
cells, including tough materials such as wood. Inhibitors
of chitin synthesis, such as the polyoxins and nikkomycins, are used as antibiotics against fungal infections.

Most fungi share these distinctive traits:

Many protists are phototrophs as well as heterotrophs, based on secondary or tertiary endosymbiosis
derived from engulfed algae.
Metagenomic analysis reveals new clades of microbial
eukaryotes. New kinds of microbial eukaryotes emerge
from all habitats.

Membranes contain ergosterol. Ergosterol is an analog
of cholesterol not found in animals or plants. Ergosterol
is so distinctive to fungi that its presence can be used
as a measure of fungal content in plant material such as
grains. Inhibitors of ergosterol biosynthesis, such as the
triazoles, are used to treat fungal infections. Another
antifungal agent, nystatin, specifically binds ergosterol
and forms membrane pores that leak K+ ions.

is driven by turgor pressure against the chitin cell wall—
the force that enables fungi to penetrate tough materials
such as wood. Fungal hyphae can extend as fast as half a
centimeter per hour.
The cytoplasmic turgor pressure is regulated by uptake of
hydrogen ions in exchange for potassium ions (Fig. 20.10).
Loss of turgor pressure—for example, by puncture of the
hypha—leads to accelerated K+ uptake and water influx,
restoring turgor. Molecules that cause loss of K+, such as
nystatin, serve as antifungal agents.
At the hypha’s growing tip, turgor pressure pushes the
cell membrane forward, and the membrane expands by
incorporating vesicles generated from the endoplasmic
reticulum (as seen in Fig. 20.10A). The ER and mitochondria store Ca 2+, whose release triggers vesicle fusion with
the plasma membrane. The fused vesicles provide phospholipids and proteins to extend the membrane surface area as
the cytoplasm expands.
Just behind the hypha’s growing tip lies its absorption
zone (Fig. 20.10B). The absorption zone takes in nutrients from the surrounding medium, such as the cytoplasm
of an invaded animal cell. Behind the absorption zone,
the older part of the hypha collects and stores nutrients.
As the storage zone expands, the nucleus divides multiple
times. Septa form across the hypha, partly compartmentalizing the cytoplasm. As the older part of the hypha ages, its
tubular form begins to lyse, releasing cell constituents. This

aging part of the hypha is called the senescence zone (not
shown in the figure).
As hyphae grow, branches extend from their sides. The
hyphae branch and extend radially, forming the mycelium.
The mycelium forms the characteristic round, fuzzy colony
of a fungus or “mold.” On a substrate such as wood or agar,
mycelia grow in two forms: aerial mycelium, which extends
out into the air; and surface mycelium, which grows into
and along the surface of the substrate.

Unicellular Fungi

Despite the advantages of multinucleate hyphae, some
fungi are unicellular, known as yeasts. Yeast forms evolved
in many different fungal taxa. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Fig. 20.11A) is used to leaven bread and to brew
wine and beer (for more on food microbiology, see Chapter 16). S. cerevisiae reproduces by budding, in which mitosis of the mother cell generates daughter cells of smaller
size. The mother cell acquires a bud scar where the smaller

number of buds, the mother cell senesces and dies. Thus,
yeasts provide a unicellular model system for the process of
aging.
Other yeasts, such as Candida albicans, are important
members of human vaginal f lora but can cause opportunistic infections. Some are important opportunistic
pathogens, occurring frequently in AIDS patients; for
example, Pneumocystis jirovecii (formerly P. carinii) is a
yeast-form ascomycete, whereas Cryptococcus neoformans
is a yeast-form basidiomycete (discussed shortly). Pathogens such as Candida albicans can grow either as single cells (yeast form) or as mycelia; because they exist
in two different forms, these are known as “dimorphic”
fungi. The yeast form grows normally in the mucosa, but
germination of mycelia leads to disease. A very different dimorphic fungal pathogen is Blastomyces dermatitidis, the cause of blastomycosis, a type of pneumonia.
B. dermatitidis forms a mycelium in culture and in soil
environments, but it grows as a yeast within the infected
lung.
Yeast as a model organism for research. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a model organism for research
in eukaryotic biology (Fig. 20.11C). Its cells grow rapidly, in haploid and diploid forms, and are amenable to
genetic recombination and transformation. The yeast
genome of 6,000 genes includes many human homologs,
such as the ras proto-oncogene (a gene involved in cancer). Often entire networks of proteins interacting in yeast
have human homologs; thus, S. cerevisiae has been called a
“single-celled human.” Susan Lindquist at the Whitehead
Institute for Biomedical Research uses yeast as a model
for brain neuronal diseases such as Alzheimer’s (Special
Topic 20.1).

Thought Question

20.1 Why would yeasts remain unicellular? What are the

of generations allows an organism to respond genetically
to environmental change by reassorting its genes through
meiosis, and by recombining them through fertilization.
Gene reassortment and recombination provide new genotypes, some of which may increase survival in the changed
environment.
In baker’s yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), haploid spores
divide and proliferate by mitosis. Under environmental signals such as starvation, mating factors induce the haploid
cells to differentiate into gamete forms called “shmoos”
(see Fig. 20.11B). Gametes of two different mating types
fuse, and their nuclei combine to form a zygote. In the diploid generation, the zygote divides mitotically, generating
a population of diploids that appear superficially similar
to haploid cells. Under stress, particularly desiccation, the
diploids undergo meiosis to reassort their genes for combinations that may better survive the changed environment.
Meiosis generates an ascus (plural, asci) that contains four
haploid spores.
Many fungi and protists undergo modified versions of
alternation of generations, utilizing a wide variety of haploid and diploid structures to accomplish essentially the
same genetic tasks. In many fungi, the haploid form predominates; for example, ascomycetes such as Aspergillus and Neurospora form mainly haploid mycelia. In some
fungi, no sexual reproduction has been observed, probably
because the inducing conditions are unknown. Species that
lack a known sexual cycle are called mitosporic fungi, also
known as “imperfect” fungi. Mitosporic species are found
in many different clades. An example is the famous Penicillium mold, an ascomycete, from which we discovered the
antibiotic penicillin.

relative advantages and limitations of hyphae?

Mycelia, Mushrooms, and Mycorrhizae
Yeast reproductive cycles. Some yeasts are asexual,

whereas others can undergo sexual alternation of generations (Fig. 20.11B). This life cycle alternates between
generation of a haploid population, with a single copy of
each chromosome (n), and a diploid population, with a diploid chromosome number (2n). The haploid form develops gametes to fertilize each other, making a 2n zygote.
After vegetative (nonsexual) divisions, the 2n form undergoes meiosis, regenerating the haploid form. (The process of meiosis is reviewed in eAppendix 2.) Alternation

Different species of fungi show vastly different forms, from
the familiar mushrooms (fruiting bodies that can weigh
several pounds) to the mycelia of pathogens and the symbiotic partners of algae in lichens. Major clades of fungi
include Chytridiomycota, Zygomycota, Ascomycota, and
Basidiomycota.

Note:

The major groups of fungi are also known by names with
the alternative suffix “-etes”: Chytridiomycetes, Zygomycetes,
Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes.

returns through endocytosis to the endoplasmic reticulum
(ER) for trafficking—just as it does in a human cell. So what
happens to the yeast? The yeast grows more slowly because
beta-amyloid disrupts ER trafficking (Fig. 2). The controls—a
yeast protein expressed on a plasmid, and a plasmid vector
expressing no protein—grow normally.
The disruption of trafficking by beta-amyloid was consistent with its proposed role in Alzheimer’s disease. But to
strengthen the connection—and to reveal other parts of the
process—Lindquist used her yeast model to screen for yeast
proteins that could overcome beta-amyloid interference. So
she transformed her yeast model strain with a library of yeast

The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae provides a model for
human diseases such as cancer because it shares so many
homologs of our genes. Most of these genes encode fundamental parts of cells, such as actin and cell growth regulators.
But of course the single-celled fungus lacks the differentiated parts and connectors of human cells such as neurons. So
yeast could not serve as a model for complex diseases of the
brain. Or could it?
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s can
result from disorders of cell function, such as lysosomal storage and degradation. A possible cause is that a protein called
beta-amyloid gets cleaved to a peptide that is secreted; the
secreted peptide returns to the cell by endocytosis. The endocytosed beta-amyloid peptide then interferes with intracellular trafficking by an unknown mechanism. To investigate the
mechanism of beta-amyloid toxicity, Susan Lindquist at the
Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (Fig. 1) developed a yeast model.
First, Lindquist and her students constructed a yeast strain
that expresses beta-amyloid peptide from a plasmid. (We
describe methods to construct such strains in Chapter 12.)
In this yeast strain, the beta-amyloid gets secreted, but it

genes that were “overexpressed” (that is, expressed on a plasmid at levels severalfold greater than normal). She identified
23 suppressors, genes whose overexpression suppressed the
effect of beta-amyloid and restored normal yeast growth. The
suppressors also restored normal trafficking of a reporter
protein, a fluorescent YFP fusion protein expressed by the
yeast genome (Fig. 3). The control cells showed reporter protein fluorescence localized normally to the vacuole (Fig. 3A).
Beta-amyloid expression prevented trafficking to the vacuole
(Fig. 3B), but expression of the suppressor protein YAP1802
restored movement to the vacuole (Fig. 3C).
Are these suppressors of the yeast model relevant to
humans? Six of the suppressor genes turned out to have
homologs in the human genome already identified as possible risk factors for Alzheimer’s disease. The YAP1802 human
homolog is a protein called PICALM. Lindquist tested whether
PICALM overexpression could protect rat brain neurons from
beta-amyloid toxicity. She provided PICALM to the neurons by
expression on a lentiviral vector—that is, a gene therapy vector derived from HIV virus (discussed in Chapter 11). Remarkably, PICALM restored normal growth to neurons that had

Haploid mycelia produce motile gametes that detect each
other by sex-specific attractants. The gametes fuse to produce a motile zygote. The zygote forms a cyst, a cell with
arrested metabolism that can persist for long periods. In
a favorable environment, the cyst germinates to form a
diploid mycelium, or sporophyte. The sporophyte generates zoosporangia full of zoospores. There are two alternative forms of zoosporangia: those that produce diploid

mycelium; and those that undergo meiosis to produce haploid zoospores. The haploid zoospores generate a haploid
mycelium (gametophyte) capable of producing haploid
gametes.
Zygomycota: nonmotile sporangia. The zygomycetes
and other nonchytridiomycete fungi generate nonmotile
spores. Nonmotile spores require transport by air or water,
or ballistic expulsion (expulsion under pressure) from a
spore-bearing organ, called the sporangium (plural, sporangia). A common zygomycete is the bread mold Rhizopus
(Fig. 20.13A). Most zygomycetes, such as Mucor species,
are soil molds that decompose plant material or other fungi
or the droppings of animals (Fig. 20.13B). These modest
molds fi ll important niches in all terrestrial ecosystems.
Like chytrids, the life cycle of a zygomycete alternates
between haploid (n) and diploid (2n) forms (Fig. 20.13C).
The mechanics differ, however, owing to the lack of motile
gametes. The haploid spore (sporangiospore) is disseminated through air currents. A sporangiospore does not

directly undergo sexual reproduction; it grows into a haploid mycelium. The haploid mycelium then forms special
hyphae whose tips differentiate into gamete cells. The gametes cannot separate from the filament; instead, two gamete-bearing hyphae must grow toward each other in order
to fuse and form a zygospore. The zygospore undergoes
meiosis and generates the sporangium, a haploid structure
that releases sporangiospores.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

In Neurospora, meiosis produces pods (asci) of ascospores
aligned in rows that reflect the ordered tetrads of meiotic
division (Fig. 20.14A). The tetrad patterns were used by
geneticists to demonstrate the segregation and independent
assortment of chromosomes. In other species, by contrast,
the asci are packed in large mushroom-like fruiting bodies
known as morels (Morchella hortensis) (Fig. 20.14B) and
truffles (Tuber aestivum). The ascospores of such fruiting
bodies are spread by animals attracted by their delicious
flavor. Human collectors traditionally use muzzled pigs to
detect and unearth the famous underground truffles.
The ascomycete life cycle (Fig. 20.14C) includes a phase
in which each cell possesses a pair of separate nuclei, one from
each parent (chromosome number is designated n + n). The
“dikaryotic” (paired-nuclei) phase is generated by haploid
mycelia in which male and female reproductive structures fuse,
followed by migration of all the male nuclei into the female
structure. The paired nuclei then undergo several rounds of
mitotic division while migrating into the growing mycelium.
In the mycelial tips, the paired nuclei finally fuse (becoming
2n), and the mycelial tips develop into asci. Each ascus then
undergoes meiosis in which the haploid products segregate in
the same order that the meiotic chromosomes separated.
Some ascomycetes, such as Aspergillus and Penicillium species, form small asexual fruiting bodies called conidiophores
for airborne spore dispersal (Fig. 20.15A). Penicillium is
known for producing penicillin, the first antibiotic in widespread use; forms of penicillin are still used today (discussed
in Chapter 1). Aspergillus (Fig. 20.15A and B) is a growing
medical problem as an opportunistic pathogen of immunocompromised patients. Aspergillus can produce toxins (called
mycotoxins) such as aflatoxin. Aflatoxin poisoning commonly

affects livestock and, in some cases, agricultural workers; the
toxin causes liver damage, immunosuppression, and cancer.
Conidiophore-forming ascomycetes such as Aspergillus
and Stachybotrys are the major form of mold associated with
dampness in human dwellings; for example, they caused
massive damage to homes flooded in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Fig. 20.15C). The flooding of
homes full of drywall made ideal conditions for the growth
of mold, which commonly consists of airborne ascomycete
mycelia. Mold grew not only on materials submerged, but
also on the surface above, exposed to water-saturated air,
up to 3 feet above the flood line (the highest level submerged). Unfortunately, most homeowner insurance policies covered damage only “up to the flood line.”
Many ascomycetes are pathogens of animals or plants. For
example, Microsporum and Trichophyton species cause ringworm skin infection, whereas Magnaporthe oryzae causes rice
blast, the most serious disease of cultivated rice. Other species, however, are beneficial symbionts of plants, including
crop plants such as beans, cucumbers, and cotton. Trichoderma species grow on the roots, or in some cases within the
vascular tissue, of the plant. The fungi share nutrients with
the plant, and they induce plant defenses against pathogens.
Trichoderma even has a commercial use in cloth processing;
the fungus is used to make “stonewashed jeans,” as its cellulase enzymes partly digest the cotton.

The basidiomycetes form large, intricate fruiting bodies

the fruiting body consists largely of cells with paired nuclei
(n + n). A few of the paired nuclei fuse to form diploid
cells (2n) called basidia (singular, basidium), which line
the gills of the mushroom. The basidia undergo meiosis to
form haploid basidiospores (n). Some types of basidia can
release basidiospores under pressure, whereas other basidiospores are dispersed by wind (see Fig. 20.16B).
The basidiospores germinate to form underground
mycelium. This haploid “primary mycelium” generates
gametes that ultimately fuse to form n + n “secondary
mycelium.” The primary and secondary mycelia may radiate
underground, unseen, until their tips generate mushrooms
aboveground, at points approximately equidistant from the
origin. The result is a mysterious “fairy ring” of mushrooms
(see Fig. 20.3A). In a forest, these invisible underground
hyphae of basidiomycetes and glomeromycota contribute

mycorrhizae (singular, mycorrhiza) that gain sugars from
trees while extending the tree root systems (Fig. 20.17B).
Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizae. A remarkable phylum of fungi is the Glomeromycota, all of which are
obligate mutualists of plants. These fungi, such as Glomus
species, form extensive networks of fi lamentous connections with plant roots similar to the mycorrhizae formed by
basidiomycetes; but unlike the basidiomycete mycorrhizae,
the mycorrhizae formed by glomeromycota are arbuscular
mycorrhizae, in which the fungal fi laments actually penetrate plant cells in a most intimate symbiosis (Fig. 20.18).
Mycorrhizae expand the roots’ absorptive capacity, while
obtaining plant sugars for the fungus. More than 90% of
all land plants, including trees, depend on these fungal
interconnections, which share nutrients among many unrelated plants, as well as the fungi (discussed in Chapter 21).
In arbuscular mycorrhizae, a fungal hypha first grows
in between plant cells without breaching the plant cell wall
(Fig. 20.18B). Next, the hypha branches into the plant
cytoplasm; the plant cell membrane invaginates to accommodate the branch, while maintaining a “periarbuscular
space” between the plant cell membrane and the fungal
plasma membrane. This highly regulated invaginating
branch is called an “arbuscule”—hence the term “arbuscular mycorrhiza.” Arbuscular formation is regulated by plant
hormones called strigolactones. The arbuscule expands the
surface area to exchange sugars from the plant for ammonium and phosphate from the fungus.

Several parasitic organisms originally classified as protozoa because of their superficial appearance have now been
shown to be fungi or fungus-related, based on their genome
sequence and biochemistry. The reclassification has important consequences for research, taxonomy, and therapy. An
example is the ascomycete Pneumocystis jirovecii. The organism was first described in 1909, when it was thought to be
a life stage of a trypanosome causing Chagas’ disease (discussed in Section 20.6). When the organism was recognized as a distinct species of protists infecting animals, it
was named Pneumocystis carinii. In the 1970s, a strain of
Pneumocystis was renamed P. jirovecii for causing pneumonia
in immunocompromised humans. In the 1980s, the rise of
AIDS led to a sudden increase in infections. Sequencing the
organism’s genome revealed it to be an ascomycete fungus.
As a result, the organism’s name was called into question by
fungus researchers; its developmental forms and biochemistry were reevaluated, and medical research was redirected to
culture and treat the organism based on fungal physiology.
A major clade of parasites now shown to be fungi is Microsporidia. Microsporidia have relatively small genomes; their
mitochondria have lost their DNA and are nonfunctional.
Microsporidia form spores as small as a few micrometers
in size, which can infect animal cells. The microsporidian
spore extrudes a specialized invasion complex called the
polar tube that penetrates the host cell, typically a macrophage. In humans, microsporidians are opportunistic
pathogens, such as the intestinal parasite Encephalitozoon
intestinalis, emerging with the rise of AIDS and the growth
of elderly and immunocompromised populations.

Other taxa originally assigned as fungi, based on superficial appearance, are now classified as protists, based on
genetic similarity. The oomycetes, or “water molds,” were
originally classified as fungi because of their fungus-like
filaments, which infect plants and animals. Oomycete Phytophthora infestans devastated Irish potato crops in the
1840s, causing the Great Irish Famine, in which a million
people died. Today, a related species, Phytophthora ramosum, causes “sudden oak death,” a disease killing tens of
thousands of oaks and other trees in the western United
States. Oomycetes are discussed further in eTopic 20.1.

Fungi form hyphae with cell walls of chitin. Hyphae
absorb nutrients from decaying organisms or from
infected hosts. Some fungi remain unicellular; these are
called yeasts or mitosporic fungi.
Chytridiomycete fungi have motile zoospores. Motile
reproductive forms are a trait shared with animals. Flagellar motility has been lost by other fungi through
reductive evolution.
Zygomycete fungi form haploid mycelia. Hyphal tips

Basidiomycete fungi form mushrooms. Cells with
paired nuclei (secondary mycelium) form large fruiting bodies called mushrooms. The paired nuclei fuse
to form the diploid basidium, which generates haploid
basidiospores. The basidiospores develop underground
hyphae or mycorrhizae that interconnect plant roots.
Glomeromycota form arbuscular mycorrhizae. These
fungi form intimate mutualistic networks of connections
with plant roots, exchanging minerals for plant sugars.
Emerging fungal pathogens threaten humans, plants,
and animals.

Other photosynthetic eukaryotes, or secondary endosymbiotic algae, arose from protists that engulfed a primary
or secondary alga. Secondary algae often show “mixotrophic” nutrition, involving both phototrophy and heterotrophy. For example, dinoflagellate “algae” are voracious
predators of smaller protists. The heterokont algae (diatoms,
coccolithophores, and kelps) are covered in this section.
Dinoflagellates are covered under alveolates (Section 20.5).

Primary Algae

The primary endosymbiotic algae include two major clades:
Chlorophyta, or green algae; and Rhodophyta, or red algae—
although not all members of each group appear green or red,
respectively. Rhodophyta that appear red have a secondary pigment called phycoerythrin, in addition to green chlorophyll.
Green algae (Chlorophyta). Many green algae are unicellu-

Algae

Algae are CO2-fixing producers in all ecosystems, most
crucially freshwater and marine habitats. In freshwater and
marine ecology, the algae, together with photosynthetic
bacteria, are known as phytoplankton (see Chapter 21).
All algae possess chloroplasts.
The primary algae are products of a single ancestral endosymbiosis that also gave rise to land plants. The biochemistry
and cell structures of true algae and land plants are similar;
thus, the alga Chlorella was the model organism of choice
for pioneers of photosynthesis research Martin Kamen, Melvin Calvin, and others (discussed in Chapter 15).

lar. An important model system for genetics and phototaxis
is Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a unicellular chlorophyte
common in freshwater systems as well as Antarctic pools.
The genetics of cell cycle regulation in C. reinhardtii provides clues to formation of human tumors.
C. reinhardtii has a symmetrical pair of flagella—a common pattern for green algae and their gametes (Fig. 20.19A).
The alga swims forward by bending its flagella back toward
the cell, like a breaststroke. Chlamydomonas cells are mostly
haploid, reproducing by asexual cell division (Fig. 20.19B).
For sexual reproduction, opposite mating types fuse to form a
zygote, which loses flagella and grows a spiny protective coat.
The zygote undergoes meiosis to regenerate haploid cells.

showed that C. reinhardtii could undergo selection by
repeated subculturing in a standing tube. In each culture, a
few cells would clump at the bottom, and the clumps were
selectively cultured further. Eventually, a strain was isolated
that grew regularly in connected cell clusters that alternated
with dispersal.
Some marine and freshwater algae that resemble Chlamydomonas grow naturally in intricate multicellular colonies.
Colonial algae such as Volvox (Fig. 20.21A) generate geodesic
spheres of biflagellate cells. Their flagella point outward from
the colony, propelling it forward and drawing nutrients across
its surface. Each cell of Volvox connects by cytoplasmic bridges
to five or six of its neighbors. The colony reproduces by generating daughter colonies within the sphere, which grow until
the outer sphere falls apart, liberating the daughters.
A survey of algal diversity from Chlamydomonas through
Volvox suggests a model for the progression of evolving
multicellularity (Fig. 20.21C). First, cells might have
evolved to grow in small ordered structures, as is seen for
Gonium and Pandorina species. The structures then might
have evolved into hollow spheres of cells with some differentiation, as seen in Eudorina. Male and female gametes
then evolved (Pleodorina), and ultimately colonies that generate colonial offspring (such as Volvox).
Other species of algae grow as multicellular filaments. An
example is Spirogyra, a common pond dweller known for its
spiral chloroplasts (Fig. 20.22A). As with Chlamydomonas,
the haploid form predominates; but unlike the unicellular
alga, Spirogyra forms neither flagellated gametes nor zoospores. Instead, its sexual reproduction requires alignment
of two filaments of opposite mating type (Fig. 20.22B).
Cells conjugate (form cytoplasmic bridges) between the two

filaments. The “male” gametes are those whose cytoplasm
inserts through the conjugation bridge to join that of the
“female” gamete. As the gametes fuse, a row of empty cell
walls is left behind (Fig. 20.22C). The zygote eventually
hatches and germinates a new chain of cells.
Some marine algae grow in undulating sheets. An example familiar to beach bathers is the “sea lettuce” Ulva
(Fig. 20.23A). Sheets of Ulva can extend over many
square meters, although they are only two cells thick (see
Fig. 20.23A inset). The Ulva life cycle shows classic alternation of generations between haploid and diploid forms
(Fig. 20.23B). Haploid sheets of cells (the gametophyte) produce symmetrically biflagellate gametes, similar to unicellular Chlamydomonas. But when Ulva gametes fuse, the zygote
grows into an immense diploid sheet of cells. This sporophyte
(diploid multicellular body) appears similar in form to the
gametophyte. The sporophyte eventually undergoes meiosis,
releasing haploid zoospores with two pairs of flagella. The
zoospores undergo mitosis and regenerate the gametophyte.
Algae serve as symbiotic partners for many important living systems. For example, certain algae grow in intimate association with fungi to form unified structures called lichens,
important colonizers of dry and cold habitats (discussed in
Chapter 21). A form of algal-fungal ground cover similar to
lichens is cryptogamic crust, common on desert soil. Still
other algae grow within the cells of paramecia and hydras,
providing photosynthetic nutrition in exchange for protection.

can colonize deeper marine habitats below the green algal
populations.
Rhodophytes include unicellular, filamentous, and multicellular forms. Several kinds are human food sources. Porphyra forms large sheets that are harvested in Japan for use
as nori for wrapping sushi, a delicacy that includes rice, vegetables, and uncooked fish (Fig. 20.24). Red algae contain valuable polymers called sulfated polygalactans (sugar

other less-studied forms of phytoplankton. Flagellated species of heterokont algae generally show a pair of differently
shaped flagella. Typically, the flagellum that drives the cell
through the environment is brush-like with lateral hairs,
while the other is usually shorter and sometimes missing
altogether. In some cases it functions like a rudder.
Diatoms (Bacillariophyceae). Diatoms

are unicellular
algae found ubiquitously in both fresh and marine waters
(Fig. 20.25). They conduct a fi fth of all photosynthesis
on Earth, and they fi x as much biomass as all the terrestrial rain forests. A diatom grows a unique kind of bipartite
shell called a frustule. The frustule is composed of silica
(cross-linked silicon dioxide, SiO2). The silicate frustules
protect diatoms from many kinds of predators. Diatoms

are nonetheless consumed by flagellates and amphipods
(shrimplike invertebrates) and are infected by viruses.
Frustules of different species form an extraordinary range of shapes with intricate pore formations
(Fig. 20.25A). The shapes fall into two classes: centric,
with radial symmetry; or pennate, with bilateral symmetry (Fig. 20.25B). Frustules of decomposed diatoms
eventually sediment on the ocean floor, where they build
sedimentary rock strata more than a kilometer thick. This
“diatomaceous earth” is used in insulation material and in
toothpaste. Diverse species of diatoms are highly sensitive
to environmental factors such as pH, and the frequency of
their shells in sediment can be used to track a lake’s environmental history.
Diatoms pose a unique challenge to cell division
(Fig. 20.26). As the diatom grows and fissions, each
daughter cell receives one parental half of the frustule
while forming a new half fitting within the parental half,
like the bottom dish of a petri plate. Thus, each generation results in an inexorable decline in size of the organism. As its cell size reaches a critical point, the diatom
must undergo meiosis to generate gametes. Maria Vernet
at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography studies diatoms of the polar oceans, such as the Antarctic diatom
Corethron criophilum. Centric diatoms such as Corethron
form egg cells and flagellated sperm. When the gametes
fuse, they form a special kind of zygote called an auxospore. The auxospore generates a frustule of the same size
as the original diatom.
Coccolithophores (Prymnesiophyceae). Coccolithophores
are secondary algae of the phylum Haptophyta (phylogeny shown in Fig. 20.4). Coccoliths superficially resemble
diatoms in that their cells have a solid mineral exoskeleton
(Fig. 20.27). Instead of silicate, however, their exoskeleton
is composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). The calcium
carbonate grows in multiple scales (unlike the unitary exoskeleton of a diatom). The plates may extend radially in all
directions, such as the “trumpet” shapes of Discosphaera
tubifera (Fig. 20.27), or form multiple layers of flat, oval
shapes encasing the cell, as in Emiliana huxleyi. These
scales are the “coccoliths” that give coccolithophores their
name. The calcium carbonate scales protect the tiny cell
from some predators. Coccolithophores such as E. huxleyi
generate huge, milky blooms that appear in NASA satellite
images. The blooms are dissipated by predation or by virus
infection.
Coccolithophores are increasingly recognized as major
players in the ocean’s carbon cycle (discussed in Chapter 22). They sequester large amounts of carbon from CO2
into their carbonate shells. Unfortunately, their calcium
carbonate is sensitive to acidification caused by the global
rise in CO2. For this reason, intensive research is focused

as E. huxleyi to pH change. In 2011, a large-scale study

brown blades that root near the beach until the surf rips the
blades off and tosses them ashore. Kelps support important
communities of multicellular organisms known as kelp forests. Another type of marine “forest” is the unrooted sargassum weeds that float on the Sargasso Sea. Sargassum
consists of stalks with photosynthetic blades and round gas
bladders to keep the organism afloat (Fig. 20.28). Sargassum supports a complex food web of invertebrate and
vertebrate animals, including worms, crabs, fi sh, and sea

Amebas and Slime Molds

The ameba (alternative spelling “amoeba”) is familiar to most of us as an apparently amorphous form of
microscopic life, capable of engulfing and consuming
prey in a dramatic fashion. While the ameba’s shape is
exceptionally variable, the pseudopods, or “false feet”
(Fig. 20.29), that it extends are complex structures that
undertake highly controlled movements. Most amebas
are free-living predators in soil or water, engulfing prey
by phagocytosis. They range in size up to 5 mm, large
enough to phagocytose bacteria, algae, ciliates, smaller
amebas, and even invertebrates such as rotifers. A few are
dangerous parasites of humans or animals. Furthermore,
free-living amebas can harbor bacterial pathogens such as
Legionella pneumophila, which contaminates water supplies and air ducts. The bacteria cause legionellosis, an
often fatal form of pneumonia. The host ameba enables
the pathogen’s persistence and transmission to human
hosts.
Free-living amebas such as Acanthamoeba species are
common predators in the soil microbial community.
They cause problems when they contaminate contact lens
cleaning solutions, causing keratitis (infection of the cornea). Wearers of contact lenses have an increased risk of
Acanthamoeba keratitis.

Thought Question

20.6 What can happen when an ameba phagocytoses algae?

Rhodophyta (red algae) have the accessory photopigment phycoerythrin, which absorbs green and
longer-wavelength blue light, enabling growth at greater
depths. Red algae include species of diverse forms, many
of which are edible for humans.

Kelps are heterokonts that grow in long, sheetlike
fronds. Kelps play an important role in the ecology of the
coastal ocean, as well as the ecology of marine beaches.

Secondary algae are derived from protists that had
engulfed primary algae. They are mixotrophs, combining phototrophy and heterotrophy.
Diatoms are heterokonts with silicate shells called
frustules. Diatoms replicate by an unusual division cycle
generating successively smaller frustules.

continue the cycle.
Amebas can have one nucleus or multiple nuclei. They are
usually haploid and reproduce asexually by nuclear mitosis,
without dissolution of the nuclear membrane, followed by
fission of the cytoplasm. Some species do have developmental alternatives, such as cyst formation, gamete fusion and
meiosis, and even growth of flagella in a favorable habitat.

Many different species form ameba-like cells. Some species persist as an ameba throughout all or most of the life
cycle. Others can convert to flagellated forms, particularly
when the habitat fills with water—a low-viscosity condition
favoring flagellar motility. Still other protist species, such as

on top of each other to form a slug as long as 1 mm. The
slug then migrates, attracted by light and warmth, to find
an appropriate place to form a fruiting body and disperse
its spores.
The slug at last differentiates into a fruiting body, a
spherical sporangium supported on a stalk of largely empty
cells that emerges from a basal disk. The sporangium then
releases spores (also called cysts), which are dispersed on
air currents and can remain viable for several years. When a
spore detects chemical signals from bacteria, it germinates
an ameba to feed on them.
Note that the entire reproductive cycle just described

remain haploid throughout. D. discoideum amebas do have

A well-studied example of a cellular slime mold is Dictyostelium discoideum, historically an important model
system for multicellular development (Fig. 20.31). D. discoideum amebas are relatively small, about 10 μm, but
large enough to consume bacteria. They can be cocultured on a plate with Escherichia coli. As the haploid amebas consume bacteria, they divide asexually until their
food runs out. At this point, a few amebas begin to emit
the aggregation signal molecule cyclic AMP (cAMP). An
ameba emitting cyclic AMP attracts other amebas nearby,
which move toward the center and begin emitting cyclic
AMP as well. Successive waves of cyclic AMP continue to
attract thousands of amebas to the center, where they pile

Note:

Distinguish the term “plasmodium” (a large multinucleate cell) from the genus Plasmodium (an apicomplexan parasite,
such as Plasmodium falciparum, which causes malaria).

Filamentous and Shelled Amebas

Amebas of a distinct clade (Rhizaria) form needlelike
pseudopods. Most of these amebas are encased by mineral
shells called tests. A major group of shelled amebas is the
radiolarians, whose skeleton-like tests are made of silica
perforated with numerous holes through which pseudopods appear to radiate in all directions (Fig. 20.32A).
Many different kinds of radiolarians exist today, and
many can be recognized in fossil rock. A second group
of shelled amebas is the foraminiferans (Fig. 20.32B).

Radiolarians and shelled forams grow in marine and

particular, are used in geological surveys as indicators of
petroleum deposits.

Amebas move using pseudopods. In different species,
pseudopods are lobe-shaped, lamellar, or filamentous
(filopodia).
Cytoplasmic streaming through cycles of actin polymerization and depolymerization drives the extension
and retraction of pseudopods.
Slime molds show an asexual reproductive cycle in
which a fruiting body produces spores. In cellular slime

slime molds, a single ameba develops into a multinucleate cell.
Radiolarians have silicate shells penetrated by filamentous pseudopods.

Alveolates: Ciliates,
Dinoflagellates, and
Apicomplexans

The Alveolata include voracious predators such as the ciliated protists (Fig. 20.33A), as well as a major group of
algae, and perhaps the most successful group of parasitic
microbial eukaryotes. Alveolates are named for the flattened
vacuoles called alveoli (singular, alveolus) within their outer
cortex (Fig. 20.33B; see also Fig. 20.8A). Some alveoli
contain plates of stiff material, such as protein, polysaccharide, or minerals. Besides alveoli, most alveolate protists
possess other kinds of cortical organelles, such as extrusomes for delivery of enzymes or toxins, bands of microtubules for reinforcement, and whiplike cilia or flagella. The
alveolate cell form is highly structured, in contrast to the
amorphous shape of amebas. Major groups of alveolates
include ciliates, dinoflagellates, and apicomplexans.

Ciliates

A diverse group of alveolates known as Ciliophora, or ciliates, possess large numbers of cilia, short projections containing [9(2)+2] microtubules. Their whiplike action is
driven by ATP (for review, see eAppendix 2). The cilia beat
in coordinated waves that maximize the efficiency of motility. Cilia serve two functions:
■

Cell propulsion. Coordinated waves of beating cilia,
usually covering the cell surface, propel the cell forward.

■

Food acquisition. By generating water currents into
the mouth of the cell, a ring of cilia around the mouth
brings food into the cell.

ied ciliates. Paramecia feed on bacteria and in turn are consumed by other ciliates, such as Didinium (Fig. 20.33A).
They can also take up smaller particles through endocytosis by specialized pores in their cortex, called parasomal
sacs (Fig. 20.33B).
The cell structure of Paramecium includes an oral
groove for uptake of food driven by the beating cilia
(Fig. 20.33C). Once ingested through the oral groove, a
food particle travels within the digestive vacuole in a circuit
around the cell. The digestive vacuole ultimately empties
into the cytoproct, a specialized vacuole for the discharge
of waste outside the cell. Paramecia maintain osmotic balance by means of a contractile vacuole, a vacuole that
withdraws water from the cytoplasm to shrink it or
contracts to expand it. Contractile vacuoles are
widespread among protists and algae, but their
mode of action has been most studied in
paramecia.

have a complex genetic system involving
one or more micronuclei and macronuclei. The micronucleus contains a diploid
set of chromosomes that undergoes meiosis for sexual exchange (a process reviewed
in eAppendix 2). For gene expression, however, one of the micronuclei develops into
a macronucleus that forms hundreds of copies of its DNA. The DNA copies in the macParasomal
sac
ronucleus are rearranged and fragmented to small
segments. The small DNA segments generate a large
number of “telomeres,” chromosome ends. In humans,
telomere shortening is associated with aging; thus, ciliate macronucleus formation provides a model system for
study of human aging (eTopic 20.2).
In ciliates, only macronuclear genes are transcribed to
RNA and translated to protein. When a ciliate reproduces
asexually, the micronucleus undergoes mitosis, whereas
the macronucleus divides by a different mechanism that
is poorly understood. Cell division occurs across the long
axis, necessitating generation of a new oral groove for the
posterior daughter cell and a new cytoproct for the anterior
daughter cell—again, a process poorly understood.
Most ciliates are diploid and never produce haploid
gamete cells. Instead, their sexual reproduction involves
exchange of micronuclei. The two ciliates of a mating pair
exchange haploid micronuclei by conjugation. In conjugation, two cells of opposite mating type form a cytoplasmic bridge and exchange their nuclear products of meiosis
(Fig. 20.34). While the cells connect, the micronucleus
of each cell undergoes meiosis to form four haploid nuclei.
Three out of four of the haploid nuclei disintegrate, as

20.8 Compare and contrast the process of conjugation in

20.9 For ciliates, what are the advantages and limitations of
conjugation, as compared with gamete production?

Stalked ciliates. Some ciliates adhere to a substrate and use

their cilia primarily to obtain prey. Stalked ciliates such as
Stentor and Vorticella have a ring of cilia surrounding a large
mouth (Fig. 20.35A). The ciliary beat is specialized to draw
large currents of water and whatever prey it carries. Stalked
ciliates are commonly found in pond sediment and in wastewater during biological treatment by microbial digestion,
where they are attached to flocs of fi lamentous bacteria.
Another group of stalked ciliates, the suctorians
(Fig. 20.35B), possess cilia for only a short period after a
daughter cell is released by the stalked cell. The daughter
cell swims by ciliary motion until it finds a good habitat in
which to settle, whereupon its cilia are replaced by knobbed
tentacles similar to the filopodia of shelled amebas. Suctorians prey on swimming ciliates such as paramecia.

Dinoflagellates are secondary or tertiary algae.
They have a chloroplast derived from a red alga,
which in some species was later replaced by a heterokont alga, itself a secondary alga (Fig. 20.36C). Some
dinoflagellates possess carotenoid pigments that confer a red color. Blooms of red dinoflagellates cause the
famous red tide, which may have inspired the biblical story of the plague in which water turns to blood
(Fig. 20.36D). Dinoflagellates release toxins that
can be absorbed by shellfish, poisoning consumers.
The armor-plated appearance of a dinoflagellate
results from its stiff alveolar plates, composed of cellulose (Fig. 20.36C). The complex outer cortex includes various

Apicomplexans Are
Specialized Parasites

Apicomplexans include many human parasites, such as the
intestinal parasite Cryptosporidium, which infected hundreds of people in the United States in 2013. Apicomplexan
cells have an apical complex, a highly specialized structure
that facilitates entry of the parasite into a host cell. Another
important apicomplexan is Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite
commonly carried by cats and transmissible to humans,
where it can harm a developing fetus. Like the ciliates and
dinoflagellates, apicomplexans possess an elaborate cortex composed of alveoli, pores, and microtubules. But as
parasites, apicomplexans have undergone extensive reductive evolution, losing their flagella or cilia. They possess a
unique organelle called the apicoplast, derived by genetic
reduction from an endosymbiotic chloroplast. No capacity
for photosynthesis remains, but the apicoplast provides one
essential function in fatty acid metabolism.
The best-known apicomplexan is Plasmodium falciparum,
the main causative agent of malaria, the most important
parasitic disease of humans worldwide. Figure 20.37 shows

red blood cells in the early “ring stage” of infection, and in
the “schizont” stage, which bursts, releasing progeny parasites. P. falciparum is carried by mosquitoes, which transmit
the parasite to humans when the insect’s proboscis penetrates the skin. The disease is endemic in areas inhabited by
40% of the world’s population; it infects hundreds of millions of people and kills half a million African children each
year.
The transmitted parasites invade the liver and then
develop into the merozoite form that invades red blood
cells (Fig. 20.38). The merozoite first contacts a red blood
cell with its apical complex. The apical complex contains
secretory organelles called rhoptries that inject enzymes
to aid entry by the parasite. The cone-like tip of the apical complex penetrates the host cell, enabling secretion of
lipids and proteins that facilitate invasion. Eventually, the
entire merozoite enters the host cell, leaving no traces of
the parasite on the host cell surface. Thus, the internalized
parasite becomes invisible to the immune system until its
progeny burst out.
P. falciparum acquires resistance rapidly, and many
strains no longer respond to drugs, such as quinine, that
nearly eliminated the disease half a century ago. The life
cycle and molecular properties of P. falciparum have been
studied extensively for clues to aid in the development of

Ciliates are covered with numerous cilia. Cilia provide
motility and help capture prey. Ciliates undergo complex
reproductive cycles involving exchange of micronuclei
through conjugation.
Dinoflagellates are phototrophic predators. Dinoflagellates are tertiary endosymbiotic algae. Their alveoli
contain calcified plates; they have paired flagella, one of
which is used for propulsion. Predation occurs by extension of a lamellar pseudopod.
Apicomplexans are parasites that penetrate host cells.
The apicoplast is a specialized organ for cell penetration.
Apicomplexans such as Plasmodium falciparum conduct
complex life cycles within mammalian and arthropod
hosts.

Parasitic Protozoa

Surprisingly, many protists harmlessly inhabit the human
gut as commensals. Such commensals include members of diverse clades, such as Entamoeba coli (an ameba),
Blastocystis (a heterokont), and Retortamonas intestinalis
(a metamonad). Such protists might provide positive benefits to their host. Nevertheless, closely related organisms,
such as Entamoeba histolytica, may cause deadly disease.
The previous section introduced apicomplexan parasites
of major importance, especially those that cause malaria.
Other major clades of parasites (and related harmless protozoa) are the trypanosomes and metamonads. The human
intestine harbors many kinds of protozoa, including both
harmless symbionts and deadly parasites.

The group Euglenida includes flagellated protists such as
Euglena, with chloroplasts arising from secondary endosymbiosis. Like other algal protists, euglenas combine photosynthesis and heterotrophic nutrition. The Euglenida,
however, also include a group of obligate parasites called
trypanosomes. Trypanosomes consist of an elongated cell
with a single flagellum. The trypanosome has a unique
organelle called the “kinetoplast,” consisting of a mitochondrion containing a bundle of multiple copies of its circular genome, usually placed near the base of the flagellum.
Trypanosomes cause some of the most gruesome and
debilitating conditions known to humanity, such as leishmaniasis (Fig. 20.40A). Leishmania major (Fig. 20.40B)
causes skin infections that may enter the internal organs. If
untreated, leishmaniasis can lead to swelling and decay of
the extremities (Fig. 20.40A) and eventually death. Carried by sand flies, Leishmania infects 1.5 million people
annually, in South America, Africa and the Middle East,
and southern Europe. Leishmania often infects Americans
serving in Iraq; for this reason, returning veterans from
Iraq are permanently restricted from donating blood.
Another major disease caused by trypanosomes is trypanosomiasis, also known as African sleeping sickness. The
parasite, Trypanosoma brucei (Fig. 20.40C), is carried by
the tsetse fly. T. brucei multiplies in the bloodstream of the
host animal, causing repeated cycles of proliferation and
fever that ultimately lead to death, if untreated. This trypanosome is known for its extraordinary degree of antigenic variation. Its genome includes 200 different active
versions of its variant surface glycoprotein (VSG), the antigen inducing the immune response, as well as 1,600 different “silent” versions that can recombine with “active”
VSG to make further variations. In effect, the trypanosome overwhelms the host immune system by continually

generating new antigenic forms until the host repertoire of
antibodies is exhausted. In order to infect its human host,
the trypanosome needs to interconvert among several different forms of its life cycle. The molecular basis of conversion offers targets for drug therapy. An example of research
on the trypanosome life cycle is described in eTopic 20.3.
A related trypanosome, T. cruzi, is carried by reduviid bugs, a kind of blood-feeding insect. T. cruzi causes
Chagas’ disease, a debilitating infection of the heart and
other internal organs. Chagas’ disease is prevalent in South
and Central America, and global warming is expected to
expand its range north.

Metamonads

The Metamonada are another major group of parasites and symbionts. The metamonad parasites include
the diplomonads (named for their double nuclei), such as

Giardia intestinalis (G. lamblia), a common intestinal parasite (Fig. 20.41). Giardia is a frequent nemesis of daycare centers, but it also occurs in freshwater streams visited
by bears and other wildlife. Giardia occasionally contaminates community water supplies in the United States and
has become endemic in major Russian cities. Giardia and
other metamonads are noted for their anaerobic metabolism and their degenerated organelles, reflecting their adaptation to the anaerobic intestinal environment.
The Giardia life cycle alternates between two major
forms: the trophozoite and the dormant cyst. The trophozoite (Fig. 20.41B) has two nuclei (and, therefore, 4n chromosomes). There are four pairs of flagella, and an “adhesive
disk” enabling the parasite to adhere to the intestinal epithelium. The cell body contains no Golgi, and its mitochondria have degenerated to “mitosomes.” Mitosomes lack
mitochondrial genomes. When the trophozoite experiences
stress conditions, such as high levels of bile and a high pH,

Giardia is just one of many unpleasant intestinal visitors acquired by humans and animals. The ameba Entamoeba histolytica
grows in the human colon, causing amebiasis
(Fig. 20.42A). The disease includes diarrhea
and possible damage to the intestinal wall; in
some cases, the parasite can invade the blood
and internal organs. Worldwide, E. histolytica kills tens of thousands of people per year.
The organism is challenging to diagnose, as it
appears very similar to a harmless ameba, Entamoeba dispar, which grows normally in the
intestine.
The apicomplexan Cryptosporidium parvum (Fig. 20.42B) commonly contaminates
water supplies in the United States; it caused
the nation’s largest waterborne disease outbreak
to date, sickening more than 400,000 people in Milwaukee, in 1993. Cryptosporidium is
especially dangerous to immunocompromised
patients.
An important ciliate parasite is Balantidium
coli (Fig. 20.42C). Balantidium is transmitted by a fecal-oral route, most commonly in malnourished
individuals whose stomach acid is low, thus failing to kill
the pathogen. Infection may be without symptoms, or it
can lead to diarrhea and damage the colon.
Microsporidians (Fig. 20.42D) were once thought to
be protozoa, but genetically and physiologically they are
fungi (see Section 20.2). Encephalitozoon intestinalis is an
obligate fungal parasite of the intestine, causing problems
especially for immunocompromised patients. More discussion of intestinal pathogens is found in Chapters 23 and 26.

Concluding Thoughts
The microbial eukaryotes, including fungi, algae, and many
kinds of protozoa, serve many diverse roles in our ecosystems. A survey of protozoa may leave an impression that
most exist primarily to parasitize humans. However, recent
genetic surveys based on DNA sequence analysis of environmental communities suggest the existence of twice as
many protozoan clades in nature as we have studied to date.
Most of these unknown clades have no direct connection
with humans, yet they may fill crucial niches in the ecosystems on which human existence depends. Chapters 21 and
22 emphasize the interconnections among many kinds of
microbes that form the foundations of Earth’s biosphere.

Crab farms chemolithoautotrophic bacteria. A male specimen of the yeti crab (Kiwa tyleri) was found at a depth of
2.5 kilometers at the Antarctic Southern Ocean hydrothermal
vents of the East Scotia Ridge. Bacteria (white tufts) grow on
the crab’s legs and pincers. The bacteria oxidize sulfides from
the vent and fix CO2 into biomass. The crab waves its claws
through the vent water but keeps enough distance to avoid
scalding by the superheated fluid. As its bacteria grow, the
crab grazes on them.

Why do chemosynthetic bacteria
associate with the yeti crab? How
does each partner benefit?
The yeti crab Kiwa tyleri feeds entirely
on chemosynthetic bacteria. The
association has not yet been proved to
benefit the bacteria, although the crab
keeps the bacteria within a region of
survivable temperature.

What aspect of the yeti crab ecology do you find most
surprising?
Yeti crabs need the warm water surrounding the hydrothermal vents to survive. The surrounding deep sea is freezing
cold (around 0°C) and crabs cannot survive under such conditions. Their chemosynthetic way of life and the need for
warm water constrains the crabs to a very limited habitat
of a few cubic meters of seawater at each chimney system.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

Microbes have evolved to colonize every habitat of our biosphere, including soil, water, air, and the bodies of plants
and animals. The yeti crab characterized by Sven Thatje,
Katrin Linse, and colleagues shows a dramatic example of
microbial interaction with an animal partner (see the Current Research Highlight). The crab exhibits a distinctive
behavior of “dancing” into vent waters to obtain the reduced
nutrients for its bristle bacteria to grow (Fig. 21.1). Katrin
Linse, senior biodiversity biologist at the British Antarctic Survey (Fig. 21.1A), leads an interdisciplinary team
investigating the ecology and biogeochemistry of invertebrate-associated vent microbes (discussed in Section 21.5).
To obtain evidence that the crab actually consumes its
bacteria as food, Linse analyzed the crab tissues for their
isotope ratios (a method introduced in Chapter 17). She
found that the crab’s biomass isotope ratios were consistent with those of the bacteria. The bacteria’s biomass isotope ratios resulted from their mechanisms of CO2 fixation
with chemolithoautotrophy (discussed in Chapter 15). The
crab’s partner chemolithoautotrophs include various species of bacteria, like the Proteobacteria Sulfurovum species of sulfur oxidizers (a form of metabolism described in
Chapter 14). To identify the bacterial species, Linse studied
the crab’s metagenome, the collective DNA sequences of
the crab’s associated bacteria. Metagenomic analysis is our
focus in Section 21.1.
Chapter 21 explores the unique roles of microbes in their
ecosystem. “No man is an island,” nor is any microbe. All
organisms evolve within an ecosystem, which consists of
populations of species plus their habitat or environment. A
population is a group of individuals of one species living
in a common location. The sum of all the populations
of different species constitutes a community. Microbial

communities critically impact other organisms in all habitats, from oceans and forests to the interstices of rock.
Microbes recycle organic material in aquatic and terrestrial
ecosystems, providing resources for plants and animals;
and deep below Earth’s surface, microbes shape the rock of
Earth’s crust.
The first problem of microbial ecology is: How do we
find and identify a habitat’s microorganisms? The great
eighteenth-century taxonomist Carl von Linné (known
also as Carolus Linnaeus) called microbes “chaos” because
he thought we would never be able to distinguish one from
another (see Chapter 1). In the nineteenth century, Robert
Koch developed techniques of pure culture, and Sergei
Winogradsky developed enrichment culture methods that
isolate microbial species and reveal their metabolic traits
(discussed in Chapters 1 and 4). Yet the vast majority of
microbes remain uncultured, and perhaps undiscovered. In
2015, a single publication by Jill Banfield’s group revealed
35 new phyla, expanding the domain of all known bacteria
by 15% (see Chapter 18).
To find the microbes in a particular habitat, we need
specialized tools. Section 21.1 begins with the tools of
metagenomic analysis—and beyond, the new emerging
tools of microbial ecology. In subsequent sections, we evaluate the functions of those microbes in their habitats and
microbiomes, including symbioses with partner animals
and plants, as well as the larger communities found in the
oceans and Earth’s crust.

Note:

This chapter presents the interactions of microbes and
partner organisms within communities. Chapter 22 presents the
role of microbes in global fluxes of nutrients and climate change.

Metagenomes—and Beyond

A major breakthrough in microbial ecology was the discovery that we can identify uncultured microbes by their
DNA. In 1991, one of the first to sequence genes from
environmental samples was Norman Pace, then at Indiana
University, who cloned ribosomal RNA genes from plankton (floating microbes) filtered from the Pacific Ocean.
The small-subunit (SSU) rRNA sequence became the
standard for identifying environmental taxa (discussed in
Chapter 17). But SSU rRNA is just one highly conserved
gene, which tells us little about the rest of the organism.
In 1998, Jo Handelsman and colleagues, then at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, used shotgun sequencing
to analyze large portions of genomes from a soil microbial community—a mixture of species that was previously thought impossible to interpret. Handelsman coined
the term “metagenome” to refer to the DNA sequence
obtained directly from a mixture of genomes.

Today, with advanced sequencing technologies, we are
addressing exciting questions:
■

Who is there? What microbes inhabit a given environment or human body part?

■

What are they doing? What function do the microbes
contribute? Do they fix carbon, break down toxic waste,
or produce antibiotics?

■

How do the microbes vary under different conditions? As climate changes, what happens to the microbial community structure of forests and soil?

Examples of metagenomic studies are listed in
Table 21.1. For instance, in 2013 an international consortium sequenced the metagenome of human intestinal microbiomes from 207 individuals in three countries.
They found that individual gut microbiomes show distinctive species profiles that are stable over time. This finding
suggests that understanding individual microbiomes could
help fine-tune drug therapies for different patients.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

Sampling the Environment

Metagenomic sequencing poses challenges far beyond
those of sequencing a single intact genome. To sequence a
metagenome requires a series of steps, each of which presents important choices. Our first choice is to define a
target community from which to obtain DNA. Extreme
environments offer attractive targets because their communities often show low diversity (thus a less complex metagenome) and because the native microbes are likely to show
novel traits. Such environments may pose safety threats for
researchers; for example, the acid mine drainage site sampled
by Banfield (Fig. 21.2A) is acidic enough to dissolve an iron
shovel. Nonetheless, Banfield sequenced community DNA
including the genome of the hyperacidophile Leptospirillum
(Fig. 21.2B). Other target communities require interaction

Sampling the target community. Sequencing a metage-

nome requires several steps (Fig. 21.3). The cells of the
target community must be separated from their surroundings without loss of DNA (Fig. 21.3, step 1). For example,
sampling a soil community requires removal of humic acids
(wood breakdown products), which inhibit DNA polymerases. Suppose the target community inhabits a host plant
or animal; what additional separation is required? Before
DNA extraction, we need to dislodge host-associated
microbes from their host. Otherwise, the host DNA could
contaminate the microbial DNA pool.

multicellular organism possesses a microbiome.

when sampling a large, dilute target community,
such as an ocean. Which community interests
you—the protists and small invertebrates? the bacteria and archaea? the viruses? If you sample the
entire community, one fraction may yield most of
the DNA but overwhelm other community members. To manage the complexity, you may decide
to fi lter or fractionate the target community
(Fig. 21.3, step 2). Filtering can be physical—for
example, by pore size or by cell sorting through
flow cytometry. But bacteria, protists, and even
viruses may overlap considerably in size. Alternatively, later, after we’ve sequenced the DNA, we
can use “computational fi ltration” to eliminate
sequences. For example, when we are focusing on
bacteria, we can fi lter out the sequences known
to come from protists. However, computational
fi ltering may also exclude bacterial sequences of
interest because they are new and match nothing
reported before in the databases. Every procedure
has trade-offs.
Isolating DNA. Once separated from the physical

habitat, the cells of the target community must be
opened in such a way that all of the DNA is released
with minimal breakage of the strands (Fig. 21.3,
step 3). We can lyse the cells by “bead beating” or
by sonication (methods discussed in Chapter 3).
The DNA can then be purified by precipitation
with phenol and ethanol, or by binding to special
fi lters. But—unlike the analysis of a single-species
genome—for a metagenome we must account for
different species that possess different kinds of
enzyme inhibitors, as well as envelope, sheath, and
S-layers of diverse composition.

How can we ensure that our protocol will be optimal for
all the thousands of species in the community? In fact, no
single best way exists to extract metagenomic DNA. Different researchers argue for one of two main approaches:

1. Sampling the microbial
target community

■

Use a single, universally applied method of DNA
extraction for all target communities. If all research
groups sample metagenomes using a common DNA
extraction method, then results may be compared across
all projects.

■

Use multiple DNA extraction methods for each target. If a research group uses multiple DNA extraction
methods to sample one target community, then they
have the best chance to maximize coverage of all the
microbial genomes in the sample.

3. Breaking open cells
and isolating DNA

Once the DNA samples are obtained, how do we sequence
them? In most cases, the sample DNA must be amplified
(Fig. 21.3, step 4) followed by high-throughput sequencing (step 5). The choice of sequencing method depends on
several factors.
■

DNA concentration. How concentrated are the DNA
samples relative to other cell components? Samples such
as a human tissue biopsy, or groundwater, will contain
DNA in such small quantities that it must be amplified.
Amplification is achieved by cloning or PCR, either of
which can introduce sequence errors and sample loss.

■

Sample diversity. Species in the community may differ in their fractional representation by several orders of
magnitude. How important are the community’s rarest
members? This question is hard to answer without first
taking a trial run at the genome to establish a rarefaction
curve (discussed shortly).

■

Functional interest. Is our aim a complete description
of the target community, such as the microbiota inhabiting the human stomach? Or do we focus on a narrower goal, such as identifying soil actinomycete genes
that produce novel antibiotics? A narrower focus allows
quicker analysis of the DNA—unless those organisms
are among the community’s rarer members.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

Assessing diversity. Before investing in large-scale DNA

sequencing, we may perform a preliminary screen for
sequence diversity of the sample by sequencing amplified
SSU rRNA genes (discussed in Chapter 17). For bacteria or
archaea, this process is commonly called 16S rRNA amplicon analysis or iTAG analysis. (For eukaryotic microbes,

18S rRNA primers would be used.) An advantage of 16S
rRNA amplicon sequencing is that we may quickly identify
many taxa present in a community, including relatively rare
members that do not yield full genomes when large-scale
sequencing is performed. SSU rRNA gene similarity is used
to defi ne operational taxonomic units (OTUs), a working metagenomic defi nition of “species.” SSU rRNA gene
sequencing reveals the general categories of microbes found
in a community, their relative abundance in a community,
and the overall diversity of the sample.
An example of diversity analysis was an assessment of seawater following the Deepwater Horizon oil well blowout,
which released 4 million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 (Fig. 21.4; eTopic 21.1). During several months
that followed the spill, Molly Redmond and David Valentine from UC Santa Barbara sampled microbes from Gulf
seawater. They used PCR to amplify 16S rRNA, as well as
genes from water contaminated by the plume of oil rising
from the leak and from uncontaminated Gulf seawater. The
collection of amplified sequences shows the relative abundance of various marine taxa at different times after the spill
(Fig. 21.4B). A sample of nonplume (uncontaminated)
water, taken in May, showed a broad range of diverse taxa,
including Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Bacteroidetes.
By contrast, samples of oil-contaminated water, taken in

In assessing diversity, how much DNA do we need to
sequence? How do we know how much of the actual diversity our sampled SSU rRNA reads represent? We can estimate the degree of diversity sampled by using a rarefaction

developed by a team at Keio University. One
common technique is to align the contigs and
scaffolds with known reference genomes.
Gap between
scaffolds
Reference genomes can be effective at
“pulling out” genomes of organisms present in low abundance.
An example of a metagenome study
is offered by the cow rumen microbiome, a highly diverse community
sequenced by Matthias Hess and colleagues at the Joint Genome Institute (see Table 21.1). Hess’s study
yielded 15 partial genomes (OTUs)
ranging from 60% to 93% estimated
completeness; 12 are listed in Figure 21.7. The completeness of each
genome was estimated from the number of “core genes” identified. Core
genes are defined as those genes found
in nearly all members of a given taxonomic order, such as the order Clostridiales
for the group of genomes (genome bin) APb
(highlighted row in Fig. 21.7). The fraction of
the core genes found, divided by those expected
for the order, gives an estimate of completeness of
the genome sequence.
The OTUs that Hess found, however, account for only
a tiny fraction of the species present, out of 268 gigabases
(billions of base pairs) sequenced. Each partial genome
assembled from the rumen community represents a bin—
that is, a set of sequence reads from closely related members
of one taxonomic unit, showing a given level of similarity. Since no two individual organisms possess exactly the
same sequence, the investigator must decide how much difference to allow in defining a taxon. Binning, the sorting
of sequences into taxonomic bins, requires further computational analysis. Factors for computation may include, for
example, similarity of base composition and similarity to
reference database sequences.
Figure 21.7 shows an example of a binned partial
genome, APb, as a ring composed of scaffolds matched to
a Clostridiales reference genome. Between the scaffolds,
there remain unsequenced gaps. In the wheel, the jagged
trace represents the degree of coverage—that is, the number of sequence reads that cover a given region. Multiple
copies of overlapped sequence represent a reliable assembly; typically, 30-fold coverage is considered good. But the
remainder of the rumen sequences are unattached scaffolds and single-copy reads out of thousands of unknown
genomes. These unattached sequences encode tens of thousands of novel enzymes for carbohydrate digestion, and are
of great interest to the biofuel industry.

reference genome may be used to match contigs together
in scaffolds containing gaps of presumed length. In effect,
the assembly of contigs resembles a jigsaw puzzle with
thousands of pieces. But a metagenome requires assembly
of thousands of jigsaw puzzles, whose pieces are all jumbled
together. In practice, metagenomes rarely yield complete
genomes of individual species, but they can yield partial
genomes of previously unknown organisms with interesting properties. These partial genomes are called operational taxonomic units (OTUs).
Genome assembly requires a computational pipeline,
a linear series of programs that combine mathematical
tools with biological assumptions to propose assembled
genomes. A mathematical tool commonly used is the de
Bruijn graph, which compiles overlaps between sequences
of symbols. One of the first pipelines to use the de Bruijn
graph approach for metagenomes is MetaVelvet assembler,

CHAPTER 21
Limitations of metagenomic analysis. Metagenomic analy-

sis is limited by the challenge of assigning DNA sequence
reads correctly to their shared genomes. All computational
pipelines must choose assumptions about binning, sequence
gaps, and other sequence characteristics. For this reason,
different pipelines often predict different partial genomes.
An improvement is the method of long-read assembly, in
which portions of sample DNA are isolated and Illuminasequenced separately and then the sequences are assembled
into long reads for further assembly into OTUs. Long-read
Illumina assembly improves accuracy and reveals rare community members that would otherwise be missed because
of low sequence coverage. For example, long-read assembly
enabled Jill Banfield’s group to sequence genomes of rare
Chloroflexi and Deltaproteobacteria with unusual metabolic properties (see Table 21.1).
Another limitation is that pipelines based on reference
genomes restrict the genomes discovered to close relatives of
known organisms. New pipelines aim to discover new kinds
of taxa by reference-independent approaches; an example
is the MetaBAT pipeline developed by Zhong Wang and
colleagues at the Joint Genome Institute. MetaBAT bins
taxa based on the relative abundance of reads from multiple
samples of a target community. The assumption is that different samples contain slightly different proportions of each
species in the community; thus, a given genome will have
scaffolds present in the same abundance within one sample
but a different abundance in a different sample. For Paul
Evans and colleagues, the MetaBAT pipeline revealed a
new clade of methanogens growing in Australian gas wells
(see Table 21.1).
A modification of metagenomic analysis is that of singlecell genome sequencing. In this approach, single cells from
a microbial community are isolated by fluorescent cell sorting or by a microfluidic chamber. The DNA from a single
cell is then amplified by a special kind of PCR called multiple displacement amplification (MDA). The MDA-amplified genome is then sequenced by Illumina and assembled as
a single genome. Thus, in single-cell sequencing (described
in Chapter 7), multiple genomes from a community are isolated and assembled separately, without needing to sort out
a polymicrobial mixture of DNA.

Thought Question

21.3 Suppose you plan to sequence a marine metagenome

for the purpose of understanding carbon dioxide fixation and
release, to improve our model for global climate change. Do
you focus your resources on assembling as many complete
genomes as possible, or do you focus on identifying all the
community’s enzymes of carbon metabolism?

Functional Annotation

Once we have our metagenomic DNA sequence reads
organized into scaffolds and partial genomes, how do we
“call” the genes? No single method works best to ensure
that we recognize all the actual genes encoding functional products—or that we don’t mistakenly define some
noncoding sequences as genes (false positives). Many bioinformatic tools are used to call genes. Some approaches
include:
■

Gene structure. The six reading frames are searched for
start and stop codons that bracket sequences of appropriate length to encode proteins (open reading frames, or
ORFs). To be transcribed and translated to a functional
product, each ORF must have an upstream promoter
sequence, as well as a ribosomal start site (discussed in
Chapters 8 and 10).

■

Homologs and motifs. The metagenomic reads may
match homologs of related genes from databases of
previously sequenced organisms. In addition, the databases include short, recurring peptide sequences called
“motifs” that are common to functional classes of
proteins.

■

Comparison with previously processed metagenomes. Metagenome comparison is particularly useful in the clinical setting, where diagnostic tests aim to
compare the microbiomes of diseased patients with a reference collection of “normal” human microbiomes.

Note that all of these gene-calling (annotation)
approaches are incomplete because they miss truly novel
genes for which no homologs or motifs exist in the databases. Nonetheless, functional genes offer a basis for
comparing two microbial communities. An example of a
comparative overview of functional genes is shown in Figure 21.8. This figure compares the abundance of functional gene categories between microbes from desert soils
and nondesert soils. Functional categories were determined
from Illumina-sequenced metagenomes using the MGR AST pipeline (Argonne National Laboratory), which
assigns functions to genes based on sequence comparison with a functional gene reference database. The most
striking difference between the two is that the desert soil
genomes contain far fewer genes for virulence and defense,
such as antibiotic production and resistance. This finding confirms that microbes in deserts are more isolated
than those in moist soil communities; thus, the survival of
desert microbes depends less on competition with fellow
microbes than on the ability to tolerate extreme conditions
of dryness. On the other hand, the desert genomes encode
a greater number of products for protein metabolism.
This finding suggests that growth under deprivation may

require a greater range of metabolic options for growth of
cell biomass.

Beyond the Metagenome

Metagenomics is our most powerful tool to identify the
microbes that inhabit an ecosystem. Yet serious limitations remain. In a study of soil in an apple orchard, Jo
Handelsman and colleagues compared the sampling rate
of a metagenomic screen versus plate culture. For isolation
of the soil community, they used a sophisticated culture
medium tailored to support growth of bacteria from the
rhizosphere (associated with plant roots) and to exclude
fast-growing fungi. From the same locations, the researchers sequenced the metagenome. To their surprise, the
metagenomes failed to detect more than 60% of the cultured bacteria.
How could these cultured organisms be missed in the
metagenome? The researchers hypothesize that the cultured organisms represent organisms of the “rare biosphere”—that is, species of such low abundance in the
soil that the metagenomic screen does not pick them up.
But upon culturing, these rare organisms are favored by

the sudden provision of concentrated nutrients—a condition that inhibits the more abundant soil organisms, many
of which are oligotrophs (discussed in Chapter 4). These
“copiotrophs” or “weed organisms” may normally be rare
but prevail when nutrients suddenly appear. Even our latest
advances, like long-read assembly and primer-independent
sequencing, surely miss unknown numbers of species.
Another question unanswered by metagenomes is the
spatial organization and interaction of microbes within a
habitat. However, the sequence data can be used to construct probes to answer such questions. A key technique
combines probes derived from sequencing with fluorescence microscopy, called fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH (Fig. 21.9A). The technique makes use
of a fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotide probe (usually a
short DNA sequence) that hybridizes to microbial DNA or
rRNA. Hybridizing to rRNA increases sensitivity because
rRNA is present in approximately 100-fold to 10,000-fold
excess over DNA. In a typical procedure, the cells of a sample are fixed to a slide (Fig. 21.9A, step 1) by a chemical
treatment that maintains cell integrity while permeabilizing the cell so that the fluorophore-labeled DNA probe
can enter (step 2). Next, the fixed cells are incubated in a

Beyond metagenomes, how do we know which genes
are actually expressed by the target community? Emerging
technologies sample not just the DNA, but also the RNA
and protein pools of a community. Metatranscriptomics
is the study of the RNA transcripts (or RNAseq) obtained
from an environmental community. The “metatranscriptome” gives a snapshot of gene expression activity of a community at a given point in time. A metatranscriptome of a
marine water community will be presented in Section 21.2.
Metaproteomics is the study of proteins synthesized by
environmental samples and cultures.

Note:

Microbial ecology is an interdisciplinary enterprise
that uses methods presented throughout this book, such as fluorescence microscopy (Chapter 2), enriched medium (Chapter 4),
metagenome sequencing (Chapter 7), isotope labeling (Chapter 13), and molecular phylogeny (Chapter 17). Additional methods,
such as gel electrophoresis, are described in eAppendix 3.

To Summarize
■

■

■

■

■

■

■

A metagenome is the sum total of all DNA sequenced
from a microbial community. The community may be
any natural or human-made environment, or the microbiome (host-associated microbes) of a plant or animal.
Samples are obtained from a target community of a
defined environment. Sampling requires separating the
microbes from their physical environment, filtering the
organisms of interest, breaking open the cells, and purifying the DNA. Different sampling procedures may lead
to different views of a metagenome.
Species diversity of a community is assessed by SSU
rRNA amplification. Rarefaction curves estimate the
completeness of sampling the diversity.
Metagenomic DNA is sequenced. High-throughput
sequencing methods, such as Illumina sequencing by
synthesis, generate large amounts of data, which require
computational analysis.
The sequence reads are assembled into scaffolds and
binned into partial genomes. Assembly requires a computational pipeline that incorporates mathematical tools and
biological assumptions. Different pipelines make different
assumptions and may predict different taxonomic bins.
Functional annotation offers clues as to the ecological functions contributed by the microbes.
Emerging technologies go beyond metagenomics.
FISH reveals spatial organization of community partners. Gene expression and function are investigated by
metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics.

21.2

Functional Ecology

All organisms depend, directly or indirectly, on the presence of other organisms. How do microbes contribute
to these interactions? Microbes cycle essential nutrients
through a food web. They also serve more complex functions that we are just beginning to discover, such as defending host organisms from pathogens, and even modulating
animal development and behavior. Cooperation with partner organisms may be incidental, as in the case of hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria using H 2 from fermenters; or it
may involve mutualism, a highly developed partnership in
which two or more species coevolve to support each other
(discussed in Sections 21.3 and 21.4).

The Niche Concept

Within a community, each population of organisms fills a
specific niche. The niche is a set of conditions, including its
habitat, resources, and relations with other species of the
ecosystem, that enable an organism to grow and reproduce.
For example, the niche of Anabaena, a cyanobacterium, is
that of a filamentous or mat-forming marine organism that
fixes CO2 into biomass while fixing nitrogen via specialized cells called heterocysts (see Chapter 18). Anabaena’s
photosynthesis releases molecular oxygen that is used by
swarms of respiring bacteria. The habitat of Anabaena is
fresh or brackish water; its biomass provides food for invertebrates and fish. Despite autotrophy, Anabaena needs the
other organisms too. The cyanobacteria grow best in the
presence of heterotrophic Proteobacteria, whose respiration
removes oxygen gas from Anabaena’s heterocysts, which
need anaerobiosis to fix nitrogen. Thus, organisms do
more than fill a niche; they construct niches for other kinds
of organisms. Organisms perform niche construction by
shaping the biochemical dimensions of their habitat.

All Ecosystems Require Microbes

The role of microorganisms in all ecosystems was originally formulated by the Dutch microbiologist Cornelius B.
van Niel (1897–1985). Van Niel was the first to show that
bacteria in the soil and water can conduct photosynthesis
without producing oxygen, using electron donors such as
H 2S instead of H 2O. This surprising discovery revealed
one of many kinds of metabolism unique to microbes,
and unknown in plants or animals. Other unique forms
of microbial metabolism (discussed in Chapters 13–15)
include nitrogen fixation by bacteria and archaea, and the
degradation of lignin by bacteria and fungi. Moreover,
microbial metabolism provides ecosystems with their sole
source of key elements such as sulfur, phosphorus, and iron.

These examples of microbial metabolism provide unique
roles for microbes in ecosystems. Van Niel expressed this
principle in two hypotheses of microbial ecology:
■

Every molecule existing in nature can be used as
a source of carbon or energy by a microorganism
somewhere. Any molecule found in the environment
can participate in some kind of energy-yielding reaction.
If an energy-yielding reaction exists, some microbe will
evolve to use it.

■

Microbes are found in every environment on Earth.
Every possible habitat for life supports microbes. In fact,

the largest part of the biosphere (below Earth’s surface) is
inhabited solely by microbes.
The van Niel hypotheses imply that a limitless variety of species carry out different energy-yielding reactions, depending on what their environment has to offer. For example,
oil-contaminated water from the Deepwater Horizon spill
region shows bacteria with enzymes that catabolize numerous components of crude petroleum (Fig. 21.10). In effect,
a pipeline spill acts as a kind of enrichment culture, in
which the addition of a particular class of nutrient favors
growth of microbes that can use that nutrient (discussed in

Chapter 4). The catabolic enzymes were revealed by functional annotation of metagenomes and metatranscriptomes.
Many of the substrate molecules, such as naphthalene,
were once considered nondegradable “xenobiotic” molecules. But all these substrates can ultimately be degraded to
CO2 via the TCA cycle (discussed in Chapter 13), although
the rate of breakdown may be slow. The energy gained by
microbial metabolism, as well as the elements that microbes
assimilate into biomass, eventually circulate throughout the
ecosystem. Even the microbe’s own genes encoding useful pathways may circulate by horizontal gene transfer (see
Section 9.6).

carbon and nitrogen in association with the plants and animals of an ecosystem. The cycles of other key elements,
and their effects on the global biosphere, are explored in
Chapter 22.

Thought Question

21.4 From Chapters 13–15, give examples of microbial metabolism that fit patterns of assimilation and dissimilation.

The major interactions among organisms in the biosphere are dominated by the production and transformation of biomass, the bodies of living organisms. To obtain
energy and materials for biomass, all organisms participate
in food webs (Fig. 21.11). A food web describes the ways
in which various organisms produce and consume biomass.
Levels of consumption are called trophic levels. Organisms at each trophic level consume biomass of organisms
from another level. At each trophic level, the fraction of
biomass retained by the consumer is small; most is released
as CO2, through respiration to provide energy.
Every food web depends on primary producers for two
things:

Decomposers

The interactions between microbes and their ecosystems
include two common roles of metabolic input and output,
often called assimilation and dissimilation, respectively.
Most of these metabolic processes were discussed in Chapters 13, 14, and 15, but ecology offers a different perspective.
Assimilation refers to processes by which organisms
acquire an element, such as carbon from CO2, to build
into cells. When the environment lacks organic compounds
containing an element such as nitrogen or phosphorus,

This chapter covers microbial down both producer and consumer microbes. In a forest, the major producers are trees, while
assimilation and dissimilation of the main decomposers are fungi and bacteria.

CHAPTER 21

The majority of carbon in Earth’s biosphere is assimilated by oxygen-producing phototrophs such as cyanobacteria, algae, and plants. Certain important ecosystems are
founded on lithoautotrophs—for example, the hydrothermal vent communities, in which bacteria oxidize hydrogen
sulfide to fix CO2, capturing both gases as they well up
from Earth’s crust. The vent communities use oxygen generated by phototrophs living in the euphotic zone (see Section 21.5).
In addition to producers, all ecosystems include consumers, which acquire nutrients from producers and ultimately dissimilate biomass by respiration, returning carbon
back to the atmosphere (see Fig. 21.11A). Consumers
constitute several trophic levels based on their distance
from the primary producers. The first level of consumers,
generally called grazers, directly feed on producers. Grazers usually convert 90% of the producer carbon back to
CO2 through respiratory metabolism, yielding energy. The
next level of consumers, often called predators, feed on the
grazers, again converting 90% back to atmospheric CO2.
In microbial ecosystems, the trophic relationships are often
highly complex, because a given species may act as both
producer and consumer.
At each trophic level, some of the organisms die, and
their bodies are consumed by decomposers, returning carbon and minerals back to the environment for use by producers. All decomposers are microbes (fungi or bacteria).
Decomposers have particularly versatile digestive enzymes
capable of breaking down complex molecules such as lignin. Without decomposers, carbon and minerals needed
by phototrophs would be locked away by ever-increasing
mounds of dead biomass. Instead, all biomass is recycled
somewhere in the biosphere. As we learned in Chapter 13,
the energy gained by ecosystems can be cycled in part, but
all is eventually lost as heat.
In the function of ecosystems, phylogenetic distinctions
among the domains Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya are of
less significance than the biological and biochemical consequences of an organism’s presence in the community—that
is, what the organism produces or consumes. Thus, in this
chapter we place greater emphasis on trophic roles than on
phylogenetic distinctions.
The relative significance of microbial and multicellular
producers and consumers varies considerably among different habitats. A major difference appears between marine
and terrestrial ecosystems (Fig. 21.11B). In the oceans,
the smallest inhabitants, phototrophic bacteria, perform
most of the CO2 fixation and biomass production. The
main consumers are protists and viruses. Viruses are the
most numerous replicating forms in the ocean—and they
lyse most marine cells before any multicellular predators
get a chance to consume them. In terrestrial ecosystems,
by contrast, the major primary producers and fixers of CO2

are multicellular plants. Plants generate detritus, discarded
biomass such as leaves and stems, that requires decomposition by fungi and bacteria. While viruses are important,
multicellular consumers such as worms and insects play a
greater role in decomposition.
The differences between the food webs of ocean and
dry land explain why most of the food we harvest from
the ocean consists of predators at the higher trophic levels (fish), whereas most food harvested on land consists of
producers and first-level consumers (plants and herbivores).
Fish depend on a large number of trophic levels that dissipate the carbon assimilated by a vast array of microbial producers. Thus, the numbers of fish remain limited, despite
the seemingly huge volume of ocean.

Oxygen and Other Electron Acceptors

The availability of oxygen and other electron acceptors is
the most important factor that determines how nutrients
containing carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur are assimilated and
dissimilated. Examples of aerobic and anaerobic metabolism are presented in Table 21.2. In aerobic environments,
microbes use molecular oxygen as an electron acceptor to
respire on organic compounds (abbreviated CHO) produced by other organisms (discussed in Chapters 13 and
14). Aerobic respiration on organic compounds is highly
dissimilatory in that it tends to break compounds down to
CO2. Microbes also use oxygen to respire on reduced minerals such as NH3, H 2S, and Fe2+ (lithotrophy). In most
cases, lithotrophy is coupled to CO2 fixation and is therefore assimilatory metabolism.
In anaerobic environments, such as deep soil, microbes
use minerals such as Fe3+ and NO2 – to oxidize organic compounds supplied by other organisms (anaerobic respiration)
or reduced minerals (anaerobic lithotrophy). Some metals
may be reduced to counteract their toxicity; for example,
Cupriavidus metallidurans reduces gold ion (Au3+) to form

University of Adelaide, proposes that most of Earth’s gold
ore was originally generated by bacterial reduction. Anaerobic environments require much slower rates of assimilation
and dissimilation than occur in the presence of oxygen.
The total biomass of anaerobic microbial communities,
however, far exceeds that of our oxygenated biosphere.

Temperature, Salinity, and pH

Other abiotic factors can profoundly affect the environment for microbes and other members of the food chain,
either directly or by impacting other factors. The effects
are most obvious for extremophiles, species that grow
in environments considered extreme by human standards
(Table 21.3), discussed in Chapter 5. Temperature limits
the rate of metabolism. Higher temperatures found in hot
springs (80°C–100°C) enable some of the fastest growth
rates measured (doubling times as short as 10 minutes for
some hyperthermophiles). On the other hand, temperature
limits the oxygen concentration in water, so hyperthermophiles often reduce sulfur instead. Extreme cold such as
that of polar regions may limit diversity and exclude all but
microorganisms and microscopic invertebrates. An example
of a cold-adapted ecosystem is the Antarctic lake cyanobacterial mats described in Special Topic 21.1.
High salt concentration limits the growth of microbes
adapted to freshwater conditions. By contrast, many microbial species have adapted to high salinity (they are called

Acidity is important geologically because a high concentration of hydrogen ions accelerates the release of reduced
minerals from exposed rock. Extreme acidity is often produced by lithotrophs (discussed in Section 14.5). The

Microbial populations fill unique niches in ecosystems. Microbes are found in every environment. Every
chemical reaction that may yield free energy can be utilized by some kind of microbe.
Microbes fix or assimilate essential elements into
biomass, which recycles within ecosystems. Important
elements, such as nitrogen, are fixed solely by bacteria
and archaea.

increasing acidity releases minerals to be oxidized, while
excluding acid-sensitive competitors. Other kinds of habitats, such as soda lakes, show extreme alkalinity resulting
from high sodium carbonate.
As our understanding of ecosystems deepens, we discover other remarkable ways that organisms benefit each
other. For example, plant-associated bacteria and fungi
enhance the uptake of nutrients and protect the host from
pathogens. Animal-associated microbes protect the host
from pathogens, enhance digestion, and modulate the
immune system. These processes are detailed in the next
section, and in the sections on animal and plant microbial
communities (Sections 21.4 and 21.6).

■

■

Decomposers such as fungi and bacteria release
nutrients from dead organisms.
Microbial activity depends on levels of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, and other essential elements, as well as
environmental factors such as temperature, salinity, and
pH. The largest volume of our biosphere contains anaerobic bacteria and archaea. Beneath Earth’s surface, most
metabolism is anaerobic.

Symbiosis

One of the most fascinating features of evolution is how
organisms adapt to the presence of others. Some relationships of microbes occur at a distance; for example, the oxygen gas released by marine cyanobacteria is breathed by
organisms around the globe. Other relationships require
intimate association between two or more partners. An intimate association between organisms of different species is
called symbiosis (plural, symbioses). Symbiotic associations
include a full range of both positive and negative relationships (Table 21.4). Whether positive or negative, both partners evolve in response to each other. Symbiosis may involve
two or more partner species, even thousands of partners, as
in animal digestive communities (see Section 21.4).

TABLE 21.4+Types of Symbiotic Associations Involving Microbial Species

Effects of interaction

Example

Mutualism

Two organisms grow in an intimate species-specific
relationship in which both partner species benefit
and may fail to grow independently.

Lichens consist of fungi and algae (in some cases,
cyanobacteria) growing together in a complex layered
structure. Each species requires the presence of the
other.

Synergism

Both species benefit through growth, but the
partners are easily separated and either partner
can grow independently of the other.

Human colonic bacteria ferment, releasing H2 and
CO2, which methanogens convert to methane. The
methanogens gain energy, and the bacteria benefit
energetically from the removal of their fermentation
products.

Commensalism

One species benefits, while the partner species
neither benefits nor is harmed.

In wetlands, Beggiatoa bacteria oxidize H2S for
energy. Removal of H2S enables growth of other
microbes for whom H2S is toxic. The other microbes
are not known to benefit Beggiatoa.

Amensalism

One species benefits by harming another. The
relationship is nonspecific.

In the soil, Streptomyces bacteria secrete antibiotics
that lyse other species, releasing their cell contents
for Streptomyces to consume.

Parasitism

One species (the parasite) benefits at the expense
of the other (the host). The relationship is usually
obligatory for the parasite.

Legionella pneumophila, the cause of legionellosis,
parasitizes amebas in natural aquatic habitats.
Within the human lung, L. pneumophila parasitizes

how does it escape? To reach Antarctica from New Zealand,
scientists must take an 8-hour flight in an air force transport
plane. The plane typically carries all kinds of workers and
equipment, prefabricated buildings, and all-terrain vehicles—
in effect, a sample of the human “ecosystem” needed to
sustain science at McMurdo Station and other research locations. It turns out that lake microbes have invented a similar
system. The cyanobacterial mats of many Antarctic lakes support entire ecosystems limited to microbes and meiofauna
(microscopic invertebrates). But within these lakes, the mats
have evolved a surprising cycle that flies them out to colonize
new locations—along with multiple components of their lake
ecosystem.
The lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys are isolated, without
outlet, and their main source of water is glacier melt in the
summer. Thus, each lake has little circulation or turnover, and
the water is covered by about 5 meters of ice. The ice surface is sculpted by katabatic winds, from cold air masses that
fall down the mountain slope reaching speeds of 200 km/h.
These winds carve stone and ice into fantastic forms (Fig. 1A).
But through the meters of ice, enough light penetrates to
power photosynthesis. The deepest water, where light barely
appears, supports mats of cyanobacteria such as Microcoleus.
The cyanobacteria absorb every photon, growing slowly over
the years, in some cases building flame-like forms a few centimeters tall (Fig. 2). To photograph these spectacular bacterial
gardens, divers like Tyler Mackey from UC Davis (Fig. 1B) must
drill through the ice and scuba dive (in water much colder
than off California). The cyano mat photosynthesis releases
a steady supply of oxygen that aerates the upper water, in a
way that suggests how oxygenation could have begun on early
Earth 2 billion years ago. As producers, the cyanobacteria support a community of consumers including bacteria, algae, and
flagellated protists (discussed in Chapter 20). These protists
are collected by Rachael Morgan-Kiss and her students at
Miami University of Ohio. The eukaryotes include meiofauna
such as rotifers, nematodes, and tardigrades (water bears)—
top predators of the lake, where no fish can live.
All Antarctic lake organisms must survive 6 months of frozen dark, when water is below zero and surface temperatures
reach –40°C. In the summer, with 24-hour sunlight, the phototrophs and consumers come back to life. The ice cover persists, except around the edge where a “moat” melts through.
Meanwhile, 10 meters below the ice, cyanobacteria are bubbling oxygen. The oxygen bubbles lift the mat, until a scrap
breaks off and floats toward the surface (Fig. 2). The scrap of
cyanobacterial filaments carries with it all kinds of associated
bacteria and protists, nematodes and water bears—in effect, a
sample of the whole lake ecosystem. The scrap halts beneath
the ice, where it freezes; and come winter, new ice freezes

annual winter freezes more below. Thus, over the years the
frozen scrap of life travels up the “ice elevator” to the surface. There, as the ice breaks open, the wind carries the scrap
away. The scrap may fall in the moat, ready to colonize anew.
Amazingly, even the nematodes and tardigrades come to life
again with all their phototrophs ready for photosynthesis. And

Wang at the Joint Genome Institute using the MetaBAT computational pipeline. Analysis showed cyanobacteria (Microcoleus and Nostoc), oil-eating betaproteobacteria (such as
Rubrivivax), and actinobacteria (such as Pseudonocardia). Actinobacteria could produce new antibiotics—perhaps antibiotics
that never encountered human pathogens. Thus, this remote
ecosystem could provide unexpected benefits for medicine.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

Mutualism Involves Partner Species
That Require Each Other

In the most highly evolved forms of symbiosis, partner species require each other for survival—a phenomenon termed
mutualism. A striking case of microbial mutualism is the
interdependence of luminescent bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri and their host squid, Euprymna scolopes (described in
Section 10.5). Mutualism can involve two or more microbial partners. It can also involve one or more microbial
partners with a plant or animal host. In some cases, both
partners absolutely require each other; in other cases, one
or the other is incapable of growing alone. The mutually
beneficial relationship is maintained by numerous genetic
responses that regulate each partner, avoiding damage to
the other. Mutualisms such as nitrogen-fixing rhizobia
within legumes can have enormous practical applications
(discussed in Section 21.6).
Lichens. A highly evolved form of mutualism is the

lichen (Fig. 21.13). Lichens consist of an intimate symbiosis between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium—
sometimes both. The symbiosis requires compatible partner
species. The alga or bacterium provides photosynthetic
nutrition, while the fungus provides minerals and protection. Lichens grow very slowly, but they tolerate extreme
desiccation.
Lichens show a surprising variety of form. Different
species may form a flat crust, branched filaments, or leaflike lobes. A cross section of the leaflike lichen Lobaria

Microbiome of corals and sea anemones. Many inver-

tebrate animals acquire endosymbiotic algae, most commonly dinofl agellates. These endosymbionts are called
zooxanthellae (singular, zooxanthella). The algae receive
protection from predators, while the animal receives photosynthetic products. Examples include anemones, clams,
and corals (Fig. 21.15 and eTopic 21.2). Coral zooxanthellae are extremely important to the biosphere because
healthy coral is required for reef formation and much of
the biological productivity of coastal shelf ecosystems.
The slight rise in temperature that has occurred from
global warming has already caused severe problems with
coral bleaching, in which the algal symbionts die or are
expelled. The coral turns white and soon dies, unless its
symbionts return.

pulmonaria reveals a layer of algae (green) covered by
fungal mycelium (white), which protects the algae from
ultraviolet light damage (Fig. 21.13C). In addition to
the algae, this lichen includes patches of cyanobacteria,
which fix nitrogen. Thus, the fungus, algae, and cyanobacteria form a three-way mutualism. For dispersal, the
lichen forms asexual clumps of algae wrapped in fungal
mycelium. The clumps flake off and are carried by wind
to new locations. In boreal (northern) forests, lichens
cover the majority of the ground and provide food for
grazing animals (Fig. 21.14). Lichens are a winter food
source for caribou, which dig beneath the snow to obtain
them.

The most common algal partners are members of the

which show different preferences for light or shade and different tolerances for temperature change. Studies of coral
bleaching due to temperature increase suggest that corals containing diverse species of symbionts are more likely

Symbiosis between organisms involves a range of interdependence, from obligate mutualism (cooperation) to
obligate parasitism (see Table 21.4). In a gut community, some of the microbial members may enhance each
other’s growth, but they can also grow independently.
Their optional cooperation is called synergism, in which
both species benefit but can grow independently and
show less specific cellular communication. For example,
human colonic bacteria produce fermentation products
that colonic methanogens metabolize to methane. The
methanogens gain energy, and the fermenting bacteria
benefit energetically through the steady-state removal
of their end products. The bacteria found within marine
sponges may offer an example of synergism. These bacteria fix carbon or secrete defense chemicals that protect the
host sponge (see eTopic 21.3).
In other cases, one species derives benefit from another
without return; for example, some wetland bacteria derive
benefit from Beggiatoa because Beggiatoa bacteria oxidize
H 2S, which inhibits growth of other species. An interaction that benefits one partner only is called commensalism. Commensalism is difficult to define in practice, since
“commensal” microbes often provide a hidden benefit to
their host. For example, gut bacteria such as Bacteroides
species were considered commensals until it was discovered
that their metabolism aids human digestion.
An interaction that harms one partner nonspecifically,
without an intimate symbiosis, is called amensalism. An
example of amensalism is actinomycete production of antimicrobial peptides that kill surrounding bacteria. The
dead bacterial components are then catabolized by the
actinomycete.
Finally, parasitism is an intimate relationship in which
one member (the parasite) benefits while harming a specific host. Many microbes have evolved specialized relationships as parasites, including intracellular parasitic bacteria
such as the rickettsias, which cause diseases such as Rocky
Mountain spotted fever.
The distinction between mutualist and parasite is often
subtle. Lichens consist of a mutualistic association between
fungus and algae, but environmental change can convert the fungus to a parasite. On the other hand, parasitic
microbes may coevolve with a host to the point that each
depends on the other for optimal health. For example, the
high incidence of human allergies is proposed to correlate
with lack of exposure to parasites that stimulate development of the immune system.

prevents transmission of cholera.

A parasite of one host may be a mutualist of another. For
example, the human cholera pathogen Vibrio cholerae is a
mutualist of copepods (Fig. 21.16). This relationship was
discovered by Anwar Huq, from Bangladesh, who worked
with Rita Colwell, then director of the U.S. National
Science Foundation (interviewed in eTopic 1.1). Huq and
Colwell showed that in natural water systems, most V. cholerae cells do not swim freely but colonize the surfaces of
copepods. The copepods actually depend on these bacteria
to eat through the chitin of their egg cases, releasing their
young. Thus, bacterial mutualists of copepods are virulent
pathogens of humans, whose cholera diarrhea returns the
organism to the water full of copepods. To decrease the
incidence of cholera, Huq found that drinking water contaminated by V. cholerae could be partly decontaminated by
filtering out the copepods through sari cloth. The elucidation of this complex microbial partnership reaped benefits
for people threatened by cholera.
Multiple partner species can form a complex web of
positive and negative dependence. An example is the leafcutter-ant symbiosis with fungi, which includes a fungal
mutualist, a fungal parasite, and a bacterial mutualist that
counteracts the parasite (presented in eTopic 17.5).

Mutualism is a form of symbiosis in which each partner
species benefits from the other. The relationship is usually obligatory for growth of one or both partners.
Lichens are a mutualistic community of algae or cyanobacteria with fungi. Lichens are essential producers for
dry soil habitats.
Corals and sea anemones harbor zooxanthellae, algae

The digestive tracts of animals harbor particularly complex and ecologically interesting microbial communities.
Digestive chambers, such as those of the termite hindgut,
the bovine rumen, and the human colon, support thousands of species of bacteria, protists, and archaea.

Animal Digestive
Microbiomes

All animals have microbial communities on their surfaces
or within certain internal organs. Many microbes have beneficial effects, such as enhancing digestion or generating
protective substances in the skin. The beneficial properties
are so essential that an animal is now considered a holobiont, an entity composed of multiple types of organisms,
including microbes. By contrast, a relatively small proportion of animal-associated microbes cause disease. Human
microbial interactions with the immune system are discussed in Chapter 23. Pathogenesis and disease in humans
are discussed in Chapters 25 and 26.

Termite Wood-Digesting Microbiome

A particularly complex metabolic mutualism is that of termites, whose digestive tract contains bacteria that catabolize
wood polysaccharides such as cellulose. The termite feeds on
wood and is completely dependent on its symbiotic bacteria.
Wood particles ingested by the termite consist of cellulose and hemicellulose sugar chains entwined with complex
aromatic polymers called lignin. Within the termite digestive
organ (called the hindgut), its bacteria form
highly complex associations with protists

Mixotricha and other metamonad protists (see Chapter 20)
partly break down the lignin component of wood fibers. It is
not clear whether Mixotricha gains energy from lignin, but
the breakdown of fibers makes cellulose available for bacterial catabolism.
M. paradoxa is covered with cilia and flagella, and possesses several kinds of bacterial symbionts. The protist takes
up termite-ingested wood particles by phagocytosis, and
then the protist’s intracellular bacteria digest the wood polysaccharides. Mixotricha also has organelles that appear to be
vestigial remnants of another endosymbiont, diminished by
reductive evolution. On the protist’s surface, four kinds of
bacteria are attached. Two of the attached species are spirochetes, one significantly larger than the other. The spirochetes extend from the protist’s cell membrane; they are
flagellated, and their flagellar motility propels the protist cell.

Two other species of “anchor bacteria” are Gram-negative
rods attached to knobs of the protist surface. All members
of the partnership have evolved an obligate relationship,
although the basis for some relationships remains unclear.
The relationship among microbial symbionts within the
termite gut community generates a complex series of metabolic fluxes (Fig. 21.18). This kind of metabolic cooperation is called syntrophy, which means, “feeding together.”
For syntrophy, the fluxes within the community must
balance energetically with a negative value of ΔG, as they
would for a single free-living organism (discussed in Chapter 13). Most commonly, one species produces a product
that is consumed by the second species, which, if left to
build up in high concentration, would result in an unfavorable ΔG for its continued production.
In the simplified model shown in Figure 21.18, the
wood polysaccharides are hydrolyzed by bacteria and

the termite bacterial fermentation include CO2 and H 2,
which can be converted to methane by methanogenic
archaea. In some termites the H 2 builds up to levels as high
as 30%. The termite microbial mutualism is being studied
as a model system for production of hydrogen biofuel.

21.5 How does ruminant fermentation pro-

The bovine gut system has four chambers
(Fig. 21.19A). The rumen initially digests the
feed and then passes it to the reticulum. The
reticulum breaks the feed into smaller pieces
and traps indigestible objects, such as stones
or nails. After initial digestion, feed is regurgitated for rechewing and then returned to
the rumen, by far the largest of the chambers.
In the rumen, feed is broken down to small

839

particles and fermented slowly by thousands of species of
microbes. The partially digested feed passes to the omasum,
which absorbs water and short-chain acids produced by fermentation. The abomasum then decreases pH and secretes
enzymes to digest proteins before sending its contents to the
colon for further nutrient absorption and waste excretion.
In the twentieth century, Robert Hungate (1906–2004)
at UC Davis pioneered techniques of anaerobic microbiology. One of Hungate’s methods still in use today is that of
obtaining anaerobic cultures from a fistulated, or cannulated, cow—that is, a cow in which an artificial connection is made between the rumen and the animal’s exterior
(see Fig. 21.2C). The cow is unharmed by the fistula and
rumen sampling.
Metagenomics coupled with bioenergetics studies shows
how different microbes fill different niches in ruminal
metabolism (Fig. 21.20). Cattle grown on relatively poor
forage (that is, forage high in complex plant content) show
a high proportion of ruminal fungi, the chytridiomycetes

All vertebrate animals possess digestive microbiomes. The
best-known microbiomes are those of ruminants, such as
cattle, sheep, and caribou. Throughout most of human civilization, ruminants have provided protein-rich food, textile
fibers, and mechanical work. A historical reference is the biblical injunction against consuming an animal that “is cleftfooted and chews the cud”—that is, “ruminates,” or redigests
its food in the fermentation chamber known as the rumen
(Fig. 21.19).

(discussed in Chapter 20). Chytridiomycete mycelia appear
on ruminal food particles, and their motile zoospores—
formerly mistaken for protists—swim through rumen
fluid. By contrast, cattle fed a high-cellulose diet, such
as hay, grow faster and show cellulolytic bacteria such as
Ruminococcus albus and Fibrobacter flavefaciens. The cellulolytic bacterial metabolism also requires the presence of
Megasphaera and Peptostreptococcus species, which release
small amounts of branched-chain fatty acids. Thus, while
bacteria compete for food, they also share in a complex web
of syntrophy.
Ruminal fermentation includes production of H 2 and
CO2, which support methanogens. From a farmer’s point
of view, methanogenesis wastes valuable carbon from feed
and emits the greenhouse gas methane. So much methane forms that a cannula inserted into the rumen liberates
enough of the gas to light a flame. Other vertebrate digestive tracts produce less methane than cattle do. For example, kangaroos have a shorter gut retention time, so there
is less time for action of slow-growing microbes such as

methanogens. Switching from cattle to kangaroo meat has
been proposed in Australia as a way to decrease greenhouse
gas emissions.
Thought Question

21.6 How do you think cattle feed might be altered or supplemented to decrease methane production?

The Human Colon

In contrast to ruminants, humans (and other vertebrates)
conduct much of their microbial fermentation at a much later
stage of digestion, in the colon, which (unlike the rumen)
resides near the end of the digestive tract (Fig. 21.21).
The genomic coding capacity of human gut microbes
may exceed that of the human genome by a factor of 100.
Colonic fermentation favors bacteria capable of digesting
complex plant materials that pass undigested through the
small intestine. For example, Bacteroidetes genera such as

CHAPTER 21

Bacteroides and Prevotella ferment mucopolysaccharides,
pectin, and arabinogalactan, among many others. Because
the colonic oxygen pressure is low, most bacterial digestion
is fermentative, releasing acetate and other SCFAs that are
absorbed by the intestinal epithelium, thus providing up to
15% of our caloric intake. Amazingly, our bodies also use
amino acids synthesized by gut bacteria.
Our gut community varies among individuals, though
certain major taxa predominate. Besides Bacteroides, other
major colonic bacteria include Firmicutes such as Clostridium and Lactococcus, Actinobacteria such as Bifidobacterium, and Verrucomicrobia such as Akkermansia (bacterial
diversity is surveyed in Chapter 18). The ratio of Firmicutes
to Bacteroidetes evolves over the human lifetime, with Firmicutes predominating in adults while Bacteroidetes dominate in infants and the elderly. As in the bovine rumen,
diverse colonic bacteria both compete with each other and
collaborate through syntrophy. Bacteroides species release
outer membrane vesicles of hydrolases that break down
various types of glycans (polysaccharides) to release oligosaccharides (short sugar polymers). These oligosaccharides may be picked up by other species of Bacteroides and
Bifidobacterium that break them down further to SCFAs.
Some fermentation products support methanogens such as
Methanobrevibacter smithii.
A problem for the colon is the relatively short retention time of the human digestive tract. To remain in the
colon with continual resupply of nutrients, Bacteroides
and other anaerobes may form mixed biofilms with E. coli
that adhere to the epithelium in the outer mucus layer
(Fig. 21.21). The mucus layer turns over every 2 hours,
but E. coli growth can outpace the rate of shedding. The
mixed biofilm benefits both bacterial partners, as E. coli
gains access to sugars while reducing oxygen that leaks
in from the epithelium, sustaining the anaerobic environment for fermenters. These patches of mixed biofilm
are termed “restaurants” by Tyrrell Conway at Oklahoma
State University, who developed the restaurant hypothesis to explain colonic community structure. The mixed
biofilm has the added benefit of outcompeting pathogens. When competition fails, however, pathogens can
get through the mucus layer and invade the epithelium,
stimulating the immune system. The positive and negative
interactions of gut bacteria with the immune system are
discussed in Chapter 23.
An exciting research question is the interaction of gut
bacteria with the brain. For example, as food reaches E.
coli in the colon, the bacteria start to grow exponentially
and release certain peptides into the epithelium. These
peptides circulate through the blood and signal the brain
that the gut is full. Another intriguing finding is that
bacterial catabolism of amino acids produces neurotransmitters such as GABA and agmatine. These bacterial neurotransmitters have been proposed to stimulate the vagus

nerve, which modulates anxiety and may influence psychiatric disorders.
Gut microbiomes even help establish circadian rhythms
in mammals, and may influence our experience of “jet lag.”
A study of mice showed that mouse microbial populations
vary over the daily cycle, and that restoring normal gut
populations can overcome a genetic defect in the molecular clock that governs animal activity. In humans, jet lag
induces abnormal fluctuations in the gut microbiome. Perhaps someday we will develop probiotic therapies for jet lag.
The mechanisms by which gut microbes influence our gut
epithelium and immune system are discussed in Chapter 23.

21.7 How could you design an experiment to test the hypothesis that an animal makes use of amino acids synthesized by
its gut bacteria?

Animals harbor digestive microbial communities.
The microbes possess numerous digestive enzymes
absent in the host genome.
Termite gut mutualists include protists that break
down lignin, as well as bacteria that catabolize cellulose.
A major by-product is hydrogen gas.
Syntrophy is a metabolic association between (at least)
two species, requiring both partners in order to complete the metabolism with a negative value of ΔG.
The rumen of ruminant animals is a complex microbial digestive chamber. Rumen microbes, including
bacteria, protists, and fungi, digest complex plant materials. The microbial digestion generates short-chain fatty
acids that are absorbed by the intestinal epithelium.
The human gut microbiome contributes to our
digestion. Anaerobes such as Bacteroides and facultative respirers such as E. coli form mixed biofilms. The
anaerobes break down large glycans to sugars utilized by
facultatives, and to short-chain fatty acids that enter the
intestinal epithelium.
Commensal members of the gut microbiome normally outcompete pathogens. Pathogenic bacteria
can invade the inner mucus layer and harm the gut
epithelium.
Human gut microbes communicate with their
host. Commensal bacteria send chemical signals to our
immune tissues and to our brain.

which receives light for phototrophs. In the open ocean,
the euphotic zone extends down a couple hundred
meters, whereas at the coastal shelf (<200 meters to the
ocean floor), a higher concentration of silt and organisms decreases the photic zone to as little as 1 meter.

Marine and Freshwater
Microbes

What microbial communities inhabit the oceans? Oceans
cover more than two-thirds of Earth’s surface, reaching
depths of several kilometers and forming an immense habitat.
Both oceans and freshwater support huge quantities of bacteria and algae, which drive vast ecosystems. Marine microbes
contribute half the planet’s productivity (production of biomass). Marine and freshwater microbes form the base of the
food chain for seafood, with enormous impact on humans.

Marine Habitats

Marine water has a salt concentration averaging 3.5%. The
major ions are Na+ and Cl–, with significant levels of sulfate
and iodide. The salt concentration is high enough to prevent growth of many aquatic and terrestrial bacteria, such as
E. coli. Nevertheless, salt-tolerant organisms such as Vibrio
cholerae grow well over a broad range of salt concentration.
The ocean varies considerably with respect to temperature, pressure, light penetration, and concentration
of organic matter. In the open ocean, the water column
(known as the pelagic zone) is subdivided into distinct
regions (see Fig. 21.22):
■

Neuston (about 10 µm). The neuston is the air-water
interface. Although extremely thin, the neuston layer contains the highest concentration of microbes. Many algae
and protists have evolved so as to “hang” from the layer of
surface tension that forms at the air-water interface.

■

Euphotic zone (100–200 m). The euphotic zone, or
photic zone, is the upper part of the water column,

■

Aphotic zone. Below the reach of sunlight, in the aphotic zone, only heterotrophs and lithotrophs can grow.

■

Benthos. The benthos includes the region where the
water column meets the ocean floor, as well as sediment
below the surface. Organisms that live in the benthos,
such as those of thermal vent communities, are called
benthic organisms.

Another important determinant of marine habitat is the
thermocline, a depth at which temperature decreases steeply
and water density increases. A thermocline typically exists in
an unmixed region. At the thermocline, a population of heterotrophs will peak, feeding on organic matter that settles
from above. An experiment showing the thermocline, conducted by undergraduates, is described in eTopic 21.4.
Coastal regions show the highest concentration of nutrients and living organisms, and the least light penetration.
By contrast, the open ocean is largely oligotrophic (having an extremely low concentration of nutrients and organisms). The concentration of heterotrophic microorganisms
determines the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD; also
called biological oxygen demand), the amount of oxygen
removed from the water by aerobic respiration. Normally,
the open ocean has such a low concentration of organisms
that the BOD is extremely low; therefore, the dissolved
oxygen content is high. This explains why enough oxygen reaches the ocean floor to serve chemolithoautotrophs
such as sulfide-oxidizing bacteria. The BOD rises, however,

into several categories. The coastal shelf
region is defined as the water extending from the shoreline out to a depth
of 200 meters. The pelagic zone (open
ocean) includes several depth regions:
the neuston, the microscopic interface
between water and air; the euphotic zone
of light penetration, where phototrophs
can grow, down to 100–200 meters;
the aphotic zone, which supports only
heterotrophs and lithotrophs; and the
benthos, at the ocean floor.

Culturing the Uncultured

To nineteenth-century microbiologists, the oceans appeared
virtually free of bacteria. Trained in the tradition of Robert
Koch (discussed in Chapter 1), microbiologists attempted to
isolate marine bacteria by plate culture, considered the definitive way to study a microbial species. But the colonies that

in 1959, the German microbial ecologist Holger Jannasch
(1927–1998) (Fig. 21.23A) showed that many more bacteria could be seen by light microscopy than could be grown
on plates. Later, with colleagues at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), Jannasch went on to study life
at the ocean floor, using the famous submersible vessel Alvin
(Fig. 21.23B).
Jannasch was one of the first to show that most marine
microorganisms cannot be cultured in the laboratory.
His observations sparked decades of controversy. How
can the organisms be alive if they cannot be cultured? In
1985, Rita Colwell (Fig. 21.24A), at the University of

Maryland, introduced the concept of viable but nonculturable (VBNC), referring to environmental organisms
that metabolize but cannot be cultured. In some cases,
previously cultured bacteria, such as the cholera pathogen
Vibrio cholerae, were observed to have entered such a state
(Fig. 21.24B)—a phenomenon of great importance for
medicine. In other cases, environmental organisms were
found in an unculturable state, with no known means of
culture. Today we term such environmental organisms
uncultured—with the understanding that their culture
requirements may yet be discovered.
In fact, emerging culture methods now enable many
uncultured organisms to grow in the laboratory. Often,

microbial growth requires hidden synergy or mutualism with other organisms in the natural environment. For
example, the tiny cyanobacterium Prochlorococcus is the
ocean’s most abundant oxygenic phototroph, accounting
for half the ocean’s photosynthesis. The abundance map in
Figure 21.25, obtained from marine samples worldwide,
shows that in most regions, Prochlorococcus outnumbers its
relative Synechococcus by tenfold; the dominance of the tiny
phototroph is due in part to its unusual chlorophylls, which
absorb more of the blue light from the solar spectrum. Nevertheless, Prochlorococcus species are very difficult to grow in
pure culture. Erik Zinser and colleagues at the University of
Tennessee–Knoxville showed that culturing Prochlorococcus in the laboratory requires the presence of a
“helper bacterium” that catalyzes hydrogen
peroxide, a by-product of oxygenic photosynthesis. The helpers produce catalase,
which Prochlorococcus has lost through
degenerative evolution, enabling more
efficient growth when heterotrophs
are present. Thus, in the ocean—
as in gut microbiomes—microbes
require surprising synergisms and
symbioses, in the midst of competition. Synergism, rather than
single-species growth, may be
the more common condition
for microbes in nature.

organisms with functional importance, researchers set out
to explore expressed genes—a “metatranscriptome.” Sallie
Chisholm and Edward DeLong, then at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, sequenced the mRNAs expressed
by marine bacteria obtained from a Hawaiian research station. The RNA molecules were polyadenylated (a string of
adenines was added) using an enzyme that favors mRNA
and excludes ribosomal RNAs because of their high degree
of secondary structure (intramolecular folding). The resulting RNA pool, enriched for expressed mRNA, was reversetranscribed to DNA (called cDNA for “complementary
DNA”). The cDNA was then amplified and sequenced.
The sequences of the cDNA (representing expressed
genes) were compared to those amplified from metagenomic DNA of the same microbial community. The relative abundance of expressed and metagenomic sequences
gives a measure of expression levels of all genes, which are
plotted in declining rank order (Fig. 21.26). The most
highly expressed genes included those encoding functional
elements of photosynthesis, such as light-harvesting proteins and Rubisco. Genes for DNA repair were also highly
expressed, presumably to correct UV damage in the open
ocean. But the most highly expressed genes were some of
the rarest in the metagenomes (colored red in Fig. 21.26).
And 40% of all the cDNA (expressed genes) had no counterpart in the genomic DNA (not shown in the figure).
Thus, expression analysis does indeed reveal organisms
undetected in the metagenome, presumably too rare for
detection by our current sequencing methods. It also suggests that vast ranges of organisms may remain unreached
by either genome or transcriptome sequencing.

Beyond DNA, microbial ecology addresses organisms in their relationships with their habitat and with
each other. We will now introduce approaches to measuring microbial populations and their interactions within
marine communities. These approaches have enormous
practical applications, from the management of fisheries
to the assessment of greenhouse gas fluxes (a topic pursued in Chapter 22).

Measuring Planktonic Communities

Gene expression: log10 cDNA/metagenomic DNA

In marine science, the term plankton refers to organisms
that float passively in water. Microbiologists use the term
loosely, as microbial “plankton” include motile bacteria and
protists. Marine phytoplankton (microbial phototrophs)
produce a substantial part of the world’s oxygen and consume much of the atmospheric CO2.
Microbial plankton, or microplankton, include numerous members of the three domains discussed in Chapters 18,
19, and 20: bacteria (cyanobacteria and proteobacteria),
eukaryotes (diatoms and dinoflagellates), and archaea (crenarchaeotes and euryarchaeotes). Nanoplankton (about
2–20 µm) arbitrarily include smaller algae and flagellated
protists, as well as filamentous cyanobacteria. Picoplankton
(about 0.2–2 µm) consist of bacteria and the smaller eukaryotes, including the smallest living cells known. Besides these
size classes of cells, the term “femtoplankton” may refer to
marine viruses, the smallest detectable particles capable of
reproduction. Note, however, that the use of these prefixes
(“nano-,” “pico-,” “femto-”) is approximate and does not
refer to size units such as nanometers.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

Population size can be estimated in different ways: the
number of individual reproductive units, the total organic
biomass available to consumers, or the rate of productivity or assimilation of key nutrients, such as carbon dioxide.
All ways of measuring these quantities present challenges;
there is no single right method, but different approaches
answer different questions.
Fluorescence microscopy. Marine microbes of all sizes,
even viruses, can be detected and counted under the microscope using a DNA-intercalating fluorescent dye. Recall
that fluorescence enables detection even of particles whose
size is below the resolution limit defi ned by the wavelength
of light (discussed in Chapter 2). Fluorescence microscopy
with a DNA-binding fluorophore such as DAPI is used to
detect planktonic microbes. Specific taxa can be detected
by FISH (see Fig. 21.9). FISH uses a fluorophore attached
to a DNA probe, a short sequence that can hybridize only
to DNA or RNA of a particular taxon.
Biomass. The amount of biomass can be determined by
standard chemical assays of protein and other forms of
organic matter. Net biomass of a population, however, does
not indicate productivity within an ecosystem, because it
misses the amount of carbon cycled through respiration.
Marine microbes have an extremely rapid rate of turnover,
but what appears to be a small population may nonetheless
conduct tremendous rates of carbon fi xation into biomass,
which is rapidly consumed by the next trophic level.
Incorporation of radiolabeled substrates. The measured

amount of biomass does not indicate the rate of biomass
production. The rate of production can be estimated by the
cells’ incorporation of a radiolabeled substrate. Uptake of
14
CO2 indicates the rate of carbon fixation—a highly significant property for the study of global warming. Uptake of
14
C-thymidine measures the rate of DNA synthesis, an indicator of the rate of cell division (example shown in eTopic 21.4).
These procedures can be conducted in seawater under native
conditions, without requiring laboratory cultivation.
A limitation of these methods is that addition of the
radiolabeled substrate may raise a nutrient concentration to
artificially high levels that distort the naturally occurring
rates of activity. In the case of labeled thymidine, another
limitation is that not all growing cells incorporate exogenous thymidine into their DNA.

Planktonic Food Webs

Marine plankton interact with each other as producers and
consumers in a food web. A simplified outline of the food web
in the open ocean is shown in Figure 21.27A. The diagram
of a food web is often called a “spaghetti diagram” because so
many trophic interactions cross each other in various directions.

The phototrophic producers are known as phytoplankton.
A phytoplankton of great importance is Prochlorococcus, but
this trophic category also includes myriad unrelated organisms, such as eukaryotic algae, diatoms, and dinoflagellates. In
the food web, bacteria and protists are consumed by larger protists, which feed small invertebrates, which feed larger invertebrates and, ultimately, vertebrates such as fish.
All levels of microbial plankton undergo intense predation by viruses. The degree of viral predation is difficult to
measure, but recent studies indicate that cell lysis by viruses
breaks down about half of microbial biomass (discussed in
Chapter 6). Virus particles represent a significant sink for
carbon and nitrogen. They accelerate the return of minerals to producers and necessitate a larger base of producers
to sustain the ecosystem. Some marine viruses are highly
host specific, infecting only certain species of dinoflagellates or cyanobacteria. Their presence selects for diverse
communities containing numerous scattered species. Other
viruses attack many hosts—and they transfer genes from
one host to another, such as the genes encoding photosystems. Thus, marine viruses are a dominant force determining community species distribution and genome content.

Thought Question

21.8 How do viruses select for increased diversity of microbial plankton?

Ocean ecosystems contain a large number of trophic levels, of which the top consumers include fish and humans.
Because each trophic level spends 90% of its food intake
for energy, ecosystems require a huge lower foundation
to sustain the highest-level consumers. This is one reason
why fisheries worldwide are now in danger of running out
of fish for human consumption: Fish are being harvested
faster than the ecosystem can replace them.
Note that actual food webs are far more complex than
the one shown in Figure 21.27A. One source of complexity is that many algal protists, such as chrysophytes (golden
algae) and dinoflagellates, are actually mixotrophs, organisms that both fix CO2 through photosynthesis and catabolize organic compounds from outside. Mixotrophy offers
the opportunity to grow at night, without light, and to
acquire scarce minerals, such as iron, from prey. Mixotrophs include secondary endosymbiont algae (discussed in
Chapters 17 and 20), such as kelp and sargassum weed, as
well as protists containing cyanobacterial or algal endosymbionts. A scheme for a food web that includes mixotrophs
is shown in Figure 21.27B. The scheme is further complicated by the existence of elaborate mutualistic associations
between different kinds of protists, algae, and bacteria.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

The Ocean Floor

The ocean floor (benthos) experiences extreme pressure
beneath several kilometers of water. Most organisms that
live there are pressure-dependent species, known as barophiles (discussed in Chapter 5). Barophiles require high
pressure for growth (200–1,000 atm), failing to grow when
cultured at sea level. Cold temperatures (about 2°C) select
for psychrophiles (cold-adapted species), whose rate of
growth is relatively slow. In the absence of light, heterotrophic bacteria depend on detritus from above as their carbon
source, but by the time any material reaches the benthos,

much of the organic carbon has been depleted by prior
consumers. A metagenome of the benthos (deep ocean)
reported in 2011 by Emiley Eloe, Douglass Bartlett, and
colleagues at UC San Diego revealed primarily Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes. Their genomes
encode a large number of heavy-metal transport and resistance proteins, which help cells survive toxic metals upwelling from the ocean floor. These metal resistance genes may
have practical applications for bioremediation.
Among the first to investigate life on the ocean floor,
in the 1960s, were Holger Jannasch (see Fig. 21.23) and
colleagues at WHOI. Using the submersible research
vessel Alvin, they discovered entirely new forms of benthic bacteria and archaea. Some of these microbes grow
in thick biofilms at black smoker thermal vents, or

hydrothermal vents, such as those of Guaymas Basin, in
the Gulf of California (Fig. 21.28) (discussed in Chapter 19). The clouds rising from the thermal vent are minerals precipitating as the superheated solution meets cold
seawater. The reduced minerals from the vents support
entire ecosystems of lithotrophic bacteria, including
mutualists of uniquely evolved giant clams and worms.
Many vent-dependent microbes are thermophiles,
adapted to high temperatures (discussed in Chapter 5).
Many are hyperthermophilic archaea such as Pyrodictium
occultum, growing at temperatures above 100°C, which
are reached only at high pressure (1,000 atm; discussed
in Chapter 19).
The ocean floor provides reduced inorganic minerals
such as iron sulfide (FeS) and manganese (Mn 2+) that can
combine with dissolved oxygen to drive chemolithoautotrophy (discussed in Chapter 14). Chemolithoautotrophy
by microbes in the sediment generates a permanent voltage
potential between the reduced sediment and the oxidizing water. As a result, the entire benthic interface between
floor and water acts as a charged battery that can actually
generate electricity.
The benthic redox gradient is enhanced dramatically
at hydrothermal vents, where volcanic activity causes
upwelling of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), H 2, and carbonates
(Fig. 21.28A). At a hydrothermal vent, these reduced
minerals are brought up by seawater that seeps through
the sediment until it reaches a magma pool, where it
becomes superheated and rises to the surface as steam.
Sulfate-reducing bacteria reduce sulfate from seawater
with H 2 upwelling from the vent fluids, to form H 2 S. As
the H 2 S rises, it is oxidized by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria
such as Thiomicrospira. Nearby anaerobic sediment supports methanogens, and the methane they produce seeps
up into the oxygenated water, where it is oxidized by
methanotrophs.
The high concentrations of sulfides near thermal vents
have selected for a remarkable evolution of invertebrate species that feed through mutualistic associations with H 2Soxidizing bacteria, such as the yeti crab (see the Current
Research Highlight). The H 2S oxidizers fix carbon from
the carbonates, generating organic metabolites that feed
their animal hosts—species of worms, anemones, and giant
clams, all closely related to surface-dwelling species that
would be poisoned by H 2S. The tube worm Riftia is colored bright red by a pigment carrying H 2S and O2 in its
circulatory fluid (Fig. 21.28B). The worm has evolved
such a complete dependence on its symbionts that it has lost
its own digestive tract.
Surprisingly, microbial communities related to those
at thermal vents are found in unheated benthic habitats
known as cold seeps, where hydrogen and methane seep
slowly through cracks in the rock. Cold-seep endosymbiosis within animals is presented in eTopic 21.2.

Freshwater Microbial Communities

Many features of marine habitats also apply to freshwater
systems, such as lakes and rivers. Freshwater habitats, of
course, contain much lower salt, usually less than 0.1%. The
study of freshwater systems is called limnology. Like the
marine water column, the profile of a lake water column is
defined by depth, aeration, and temperature (Fig. 21.29).
Large, undisturbed lakes are usually oligotrophic,
with dilute concentrations of nutrients and microbes
(Fig. 21.29A). The warm upper water layer above the thermocline is called the epilimnion. The epilimnion water is
warm, well mixed, and oxygenated relative to the lower
layers of water, which are isolated from the atmosphere. It
supports oxygenic phototrophs such as algae and cyanobacteria. Below the epilimnion lies a thermocline, a steep transition zone to colder, denser water below.
The epilimnion reaches only about 10 meters in depth,
much shallower than the marine euphotic zone. In a lake,
the depth of light penetration varies greatly, depending
on the concentration of microbes and particulate matter. At
the edge of the lake, where the upper layer becomes shallow enough for rooted plants, is the littoral zone. In the
deeper water, below the epilimnion, lies the hypolimnion, a
region that becomes anoxic.
A lake that receives large concentrations of nutrients,
such as runoff from agricultural fertilizer or septic systems,
becomes eutrophic (Fig. 21.29B). In a eutrophic lake,
the nutrients support growth of algae to high densities,
causing an algal bloom (Fig. 21.29C). The algal bloom
is rapidly consumed by heterotrophic bacteria, whose respiration removes all the oxygen. This oxygen loss causes
the anoxic hypolimnion to reach nearly up to the surface
of the lake.
But all fish and invertebrates need access to the epilimnion for oxygen. In a eutrophic lake, fish die off owing to
lack of oxygen, which heterotrophic microbes have consumed. Such a lake is said to have a high level of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). For example, in 2010, fertilizer
runoff caused eutrophication of Grand Lake St. Marys in
Ohio. The lake was covered with thick green algae that
released toxins, depleted oxygen, ruined boat hulls, and
prevented human use of the lake.
Common causes of eutrophication include:
■

Phosphates. Because phosphorus is commonly a limiting nutrient (nutrient in shortest supply) for algae, addition of phosphates from detergents and fertilizers can
lead to an algal bloom.

■

Nitrogen from sewage effluents and agricultural fertilizer runoff can lead to algal blooms by relieving nitrogen
limitation.

■

Organic pollutants from sewage effluents overfeed heterotrophic bacteria, depleting the epilimnion of oxygen.

In a eutrophic lake, the lower layers have become
depleted of oxygen as a result of overgrowth of microbial
producers and consumers. Thermal stratification may break
up, and the lake may mix one to several times per year, thus
reoxygenating the entire lake. A permanently eutrophic
lake typically supports ten times the microbial concentrations of an oligotrophic lake (see Fig. 21.29A and B), but

H2S-oxidizing phototrophs such as Chlorobium and Rhodopseudomonas. Although H 2S photolysis provides less energy
than oxygenic H 2O photolysis, these bacteria have evolved
to use chlorophylls whose spectrum extends into the infrared (Fig. 21.30). Light in the infrared portions of the spectrum cannot be used by oxygenic phototrophs, because the
photon energy is insufficient to split water. The less efficient
H2S photolyzers, however, can harness the energy of red and
infrared radiation (discussed in Chapter 14). H 2S-oxidizing
phototrophs overlap metabolically with anaerobic heterotrophs and lithotrophs that reduce oxidized minerals. Some

bacteria, such as Rhodospirillum rubrum, can grow anaerobically with or without light; others grow only by anaerobic
metabolism, unassisted by light. These low-oxygen bacteria
form a flourishing community, but they cannot support oxygen-breathing consumers such as fish.
At the bottom of the water column, the water meets
the sediment (benthos). In the benthic sediment, gradients develop in which successive electron acceptors
become reduced by anaerobic respirers and lithotrophs
(Fig. 21.31). Electron acceptors that yield the most
energy are consumed first; as each in turn is depleted, the
electron acceptor with the most energy is consumed next.
First, molecular oxygen is used to oxidize organic material

and reduced minerals such as NH4+. Below, as molecular oxygen falls off, bacteria use nitrate (NO3 –) from oxidized ammonium ion as an electron acceptor to respire on
remaining organic material. As the nitrate is used up, still
other bacteria use manganese (Mn4+) as an electron acceptor, followed by iron (Fe3+) and sulfate (SO 4 2–). Reduction of sulfate leads to H 2 S, which eventually returns to
the upper layers supporting anaerobic photolysis. Reduction of CO2 by H 2 produces methane (CH4). Methane
collects below and sometimes ignites when it escapes to
the surface. Methane from freshwater lakes and streams is
emerging as a major contributor to global warming (discussed in Chapter 22).

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

Note:

Certain minerals and organic molecules occur in equilibrium between ionized and un-ionized states over the range of
pH typical of most common habitats (pH 4–9). Examples include
ammonia (NH3), which protonates to ammonium ion (NH4+), and
organic acids such as acetic acid (CH3COOH), which deprotonates
to acetate (CH3COO –). In this chapter we refer to the form most
prevalent at pH 7 unless stated otherwise.

Throughout the water column, protists consume algae
and bacteria, while fungi decompose detritus. Protists and
fungi also interact with invertebrates and fish as parasites.
Other important consumers are the viruses, which lyse
about half of microbial populations in lakes, as they do in
the ocean. Viruses limit the number of microbes and keep
the water clear enough for light to penetrate.

To Summarize

The euphotic zone of the ocean is the upper part of
the water column that receives light for phototrophs.
Below, in the aphotic zone, only heterotrophs and lithotrophs can grow. The benthos includes the region where
the water column meets the ocean floor, as well as sediment below the surface.
Most marine microbes either cannot be cultured or
require special culturing methods. Some can be cultured using conditions that mimic their natural habitat,
and allow intimate association with other species that
provide growth factors such as siderophores.
Plankton are small floating organisms, including
swimming microbes. Phytoplankton are phototrophs
such as cyanobacteria and algae. Microbial consumers
include protists and viruses. Many marine protists are
mixotrophs (producers and consumers in one).
Picoplankton include bacteria and small microbial
eukaryotes. They are measured by fluorescence microscopy. Their biochemical rate of production is estimated
by uptake of radiolabeled nutrients.
Benthic microbes are barophiles. The seafloor supports
psychrophiles, whereas hydrothermal vents support thermophiles. Vents and cold seeps support sulfur- and metaloxidizing bacteria, sulfur-reducing bacteria, methanogens,
and methanotrophs. Bacteria that oxidize H2S and methane feed symbiotic animals such as tube worms.
Freshwater lakes have stratified water levels. As depth
increases, minerals become increasingly reduced. Anaerobic forms of metabolism predominate, with the more
favorable alternative electron acceptors used in turn.
Lakes may be oligotrophic or eutrophic. Eutrophic
lakes may show such high biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD) that the oxygen concentration falls to levels too
low to support vertebrate life.

21.6

Soil and Plant Microbial
Communities

In contrast to the ocean, where the base of producers is
almost entirely microbial, the major producers of terrestrial ecosystems are macroscopic plants. Plants vary
greatly in size and form, from mosses and bryophytes to
prairie grasses and forest trees, but most terrestrial plants
are rooted in soil. Soil is a complex mixture of decaying
organic and mineral matter that feeds vast communities
of microbes. Soil is arguably the most complex microbial ecosystem on our planet. And soil-based agriculture
is the major source of food for our planet’s human inhabitants. The qualities of a given soil—oxygenated or water
saturated, acidic or alkaline, salty or fresh, nutrient-rich
or -poor—define what food can be grown and whether the
human community will eat or starve.

Soil Microbiology

The general structure of soil (Fig. 21.32) includes a series
of layers called “horizons” that arise as a result of soil-forming factors such as rainfall, temperature variation, wind,
and biological activity. Note that the soils of different habitats, such as prairie, forest, and desert, vary greatly as to the
depth and quality of each layer.
The surface layer of soil we see is the organic horizon
(O horizon). The organic horizon consists of dark, organic
detritus, such as shreds of leaves fallen from plants. The detritus
of the organic horizon is in the earliest stages of decomposition
by microbes, primarily fungi and bacteria such as actinomycetes. Early-stage decomposition is defined loosely as a state in
which the origin of the detritus may be still recognizable.
Beneath the organic horizon lies the lighter-colored
aerated horizon (A horizon), in which organic particles in
more advanced stages of decomposition combine with minerals from rock at lower levels. In the aerated horizon, the
source of the organic particles is no longer recognizable,
and decomposers have broken down some of the more difficult-to-digest plant structural components, such as lignin
(a complex aromatic polymer found in wood; discussed in
the next section). This partly decomposed material is often
sold by garden stores as peat or topsoil.
In well-drained soil, both the organic and aerated horizons are full of oxygen, as well as nutrients liberated by the
decomposers and used by plants. Soil consists of a complex
assemblage of organic and inorganic particles (Fig. 21.32).
Between the soil particles are air spaces that provide access
to oxygen, allowing aerobic respiration. Each particle of
soil supports miniature colonies, biofilms, and filaments of
bacteria and fungi that interact with each other and with
the roots of plants (Fig. 21.33).

crustal rock as deep as 3 km down contains endoliths, bacteria growing between crystals of solid rock. What energy
source feeds microbes trapped within rock? For some endoliths, a surprising answer may be the radioactive decay of
uranium. Uranium-238 decay generates hydrogen radicals that combine to form hydrogen gas. The hydrogen
gas combines with CO2 from carbonate rock, providing an
electron donor and a carbon source for methanogens and
other endolithic lithotrophs.

Below the aerated horizon, the eluviated horizon (E
horizon) experiences periods of water saturation from rain
(see Fig. 21.32). Rainwater leaches (dissolves and removes)
some of the organic and mineral nutrients from the upper
layers. Below the eluviated horizon lie increasing proportions of minerals and rock fragments broken off from bedrock below. These lower water-saturated layers form the
water table. This anoxic, water-saturated region contains
mainly lithotrophs and anaerobic heterotrophs.
The soil layers finally end at bedrock, a source of mineral
nutrients such as carbonates and iron. Interestingly, bedrock is permeated with microbes. Core samples show that

The top horizons of soil feature a food web of extraordinary complexity (Fig. 21.34). The major producers are
green plants, whose leaves generate detritus and whose
root systems feed predators, scavengers, and mutualists. Some carbon is also fixed by lithotrophs oxidizing
reduced nitrogen (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), and
iron (Fe2+). In well-aerated soil, however, the proportion
of carbon fixed by lithotrophs is small compared to that
fixed by plants.
Plant matter is decomposed by many species of fungi,
such as Mycena species, and by bacteria such as the actinomycetes. The actinomycetes include Streptomyces, a genus
famous for the production of antibiotics and for generating chemicals whose odors give soil its characteristic smell

(Fig. 21.35A). Besides fallen leaves, another source of
organic matter from plants is the rhizosphere, the region
of soil surrounding plant roots. The rhizosphere contains
proteins and sugars released by roots, as well as sloughedoff plant cells. These materials feed large numbers of bacteria, which then cycle minerals back to the plant. Bacteria
in the rhizosphere may also discourage growth of plant
pathogens.
In the aerated zone, bacteria feeding on leaf detritus and root exudates are then preyed on by protists and

nematodes. Many complex interactions occur. The nematode Heterorhabditis bacteriophora (Fig. 21.35B) carries symbiotic Photorhabdus luminescens bacteria, which it
alternately consumes and transmits as a mutualist when it
infects an insect. Vampirella protists drill holes in fungal
hyphae to suck out their nutrients. Parasitic fungi prey on

nematodes. Mycorrhizal fungi extend the absorptive surface area of plant roots. Microbes ultimately feed invertebrates, which then feed larger invertebrates and vertebrate

predators. Some predators, such as earthworms and burrowing animals, enhance the soil quality by turning over
the matter, thus aerating the soil particles and helping to
mix the organic matter from above with the mineral particles from below.
A critical role of fungal decomposers (also known as saprophytes) is the breakdown of extremely complex structural components of vascular plants such as grass and trees
(Fig. 21.36). Trees, in particular, accumulate vast stores
of biomass in forms that are difficult to digest, such as lignin. Lignin is a highly complex and diverse covalent polymer composed of interlinked phenolic groups (benzene
rings with OH or related oxygen-bearing side groups)
(Fig. 21.36A). We saw earlier that termites host protozoa
that help degrade the lignin portion of wood particles. In
soil, fungi and bacterial decomposers possess enzyme systems to degrade lignin and other complex components of
plants. Examples of decomposers include white rot fungi
(Fig. 21.36B) and actinomycete soil bacteria. The prevalence of lignin is one reason that decomposition by fungi
plays a much larger role in terrestrial ecosystems than in
marine ecosystems.
The first phase of microbial degradation (about 50% of
the carbon) is complete within a year of deposition in the
soil. The remaining phenolics, however, may be degraded
at less than 5% per year, and some samples dated by 14C
isotope ratios have been shown to last 2,000 years. These
phenolic molecules are called humic material or humus.
Because of its slow degradation, humic material provides
a steady slow-release supply of nutrients for plant growth.
But forests whose rate of microbial decomposition is particularly low—for example, the New Jersey Pine Barrens—
depend on fire to clear the mounting layers of humus and
return its minerals to the ecosystem.

Microbes Associated with Roots

The presence of plant roots provides yet another level of
complexity to soil communities (Fig. 21.37). Plant roots
influence the surrounding soil by taking up nutrients and
by secreting organic substances and molecules that modulate their surroundings. The environment surrounding a
plant root can be further subdivided into two categories:
the rhizoplane, the root surface; and the rhizosphere, the
region of soil outside the root surface but still influenced
by plant exudates (materials secreted by the plant). Particular bacterial species are adapted to these environments. For
example, in anaerobic wetland soil, the rhizoplane and rhizosphere of plant roots provide oxygen for methanotrophs
that oxidize methane produced by methanogens.
The rhizoplane and rhizosphere also provide the environment for symbiotic fungi that generate mycorrhizae. At
least 80% of plants in nature, including 90% of forest trees,
require mycorrhizae for optimal growth.

plant root surface. The rhizosphere is the soil outside the rhizoplane
that receives substances from the root, such as mucilage, sloughed
cells, and exudates.

Mycorrhizae: The Fungal Internet

The function and significance of mycorrhizae for plant
growth is just beginning to be understood. Mycorrhizae (singular, mycorrhiza; from myco, “fungal,” and
rhiza, “root”) consist of fungal mycelia that associate
intimately with the roots of plants, extending access to
minerals while obtaining in return the energy-rich products of plant photosynthesis. Mycorrhizae were first discovered in the 1880s by German truffle hunters who
sought to cultivate the prized delicacy, the fruiting body
of an ascomycete (for review of fungi, see Chapter 20).
The propagation of truffles was investigated by mycologist Albert Frank at the Agricultural University of Berlin.
To his surprise, Frank found that the truffles extended
their mycelia far beyond the site of the fruiting body, and
that the mycelia formed an impenetrable tangle with plant
roots. Frank called the tangled mycelia “fungus-roots” or
mycorrhizae. A century later, we are beginning to appreciate that these mysterious fungus-root tangles offer a vast
interconnected network for exchange of nutrients among
fungi and many different plants, like an internet connecting countless sites.
Two different kinds of mycorrhizae are observed: ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae. Ectomycorrhizae
colonize the rhizoplane, the surface of plant rootlets—the
most distal part of plant roots (Fig. 21.38). The fungal
mycelia never penetrate the root cells. They form a thick
mantle surrounding the root and growing between the
root cells, and then extend long mycelia away from the
root to absorb nutrients. Numerous kinds of fungi form
ectomycorrhizae, including ascomycetes (such as truffles)
and basidiomycetes, known by their mushrooms (such as
stinkhorns). Plants grown with ectomycorrhizae invest
less of their body mass in roots and more in the aboveground stems and leaves—an important consideration for
agriculture, in which the aboveground plant is usually the
part harvested.
Endomycorrhizae form a more intimate association, in
which the fungal hyphae penetrate plant cells deep within
the cortex (Fig. 21.39). The penetrating hyphae form
knobbed branches that resemble microscopic “trees,” or
arbuscules, within the root cells. Some of the hyphae form
specialized vesicles within the plant that store nutrients.
Another name for this kind of mycorrhizae is vesiculararbuscular mycorrhizae (VAM).
Endomycorrhizae are more specialized than ectomycorrhizae. They comprise a relatively small number of fungal species, such as members of the Glomeromycota genus
Glomus, and they show obligate dependence on their host
plants. Their presence in nature and their importance in
the ecosystem, however, are actually greater. Endomycorrhizal species exist entirely underground (they do not form
mushrooms), and they completely lack sexual cycles. They

Mycorrhizae greatly enhance the plant’s uptake of water,
as well as minerals such as nitrogen and phosphorus. In
addition, the hyphae sequester toxins, and they actually
distribute organic substances from one plant to another.

Mycorrhizae may join many different plants, even different
species, in a vast, nutrient-sharing network.

overall productivity, anaerobic soil contributes to the nutritional diversity of wetland ecosystems. The relatively slow
rate of decomposition can lead to accumulation of high levels
of organic carbon, particularly rich for plant growth.
The anoxic conditions of wetlands also favor methanogenesis. Methanogenesis is performed solely by archaea

and bacteria. Thus, when we eat plants, we also consume all
their endophytes, or endophytic microbes (Fig. 21.41).
Some endophytes are obligate (can live only within the
plant), whereas others, such as pseudomonads, have alternative lifestyles in the soil. The microbial partners may grow as
mutualists, commensals, or parasites. Plants tolerate endophytes because they confer substantial benefits. For example,
prairie grasses called fescue, grazed by cattle in the southeastern United States, host fungal epiphytes. The fungi, Neotyphodium coenophialum, produce alkaloids that deter insect
predators, pathogens, and root-feeding nematodes. Unfortunately, some of the alkaloids poison cattle, but agricultural
scientists have engineered fungal strains that still protect the
plant from pathogens while allowing cattle to graze.
Human pathogens such as E. coli O157:H7 and Salmonella enterica can grow endophytically in crop plants such
as spinach and alfalfa. Endophytic pathogens pose a problem for the food industry because the bacteria cannot be
“washed off” from raw produce. On the other hand, endophytes such as Stenotrophomonas species have potentially
valuable uses. Stenotrophomonas bacteria produce enzymes
that deter many plant pathogens. The bacteria also absorb

A form of bacteria-plant mutualism critical for agriculture is
that of nitrogen fixation by rhizobia (singular, rhizobium),
a group of soil-dwelling Alphaproteobacteria (discussed in
Chapter 18). Major rhizobial genera include Rhizobium,
Bradyrhizobium, and Sinorhizobium. Rhizobia, associated
with legumes such as peas and beans, fix more nitrogen
than the plants absorb from soil, actually increasing the soil’s
nitrogen content. For this reason, farmers often alternate
crops such as corn with soybeans to restore nitrogen to the
soil. The rhizobial bacteria develop specialized forms within
plant cells, called bacteroids. Bacteroids lack cell walls
and are unable to reproduce; their function is specialized
for nitrogen fixation. The rhizobial infection of root hairs
induces the formation of nodules within which the nitrogenfixing bacteroids are sequestered (Fig. 21.42).

The initiation, development, and maintenance of the
rhizobia-legume symbiosis poses intriguing questions of
genetic regulation. How does the association begin? How
do host plant and bacterium recognize each other as suitable partners? The legume exudes signaling molecules
called flavonoids into its rhizosphere. Flavonoids resemble
steroid hormones such as estrogen and have similar effects
on animals; they are also called phytoestrogens. The flavonoids are detected by rhizobial bacteria, which respond by
chemotaxis, swimming toward the root surface. Flavonoids
then induce bacterial expression of Nod factors, molecules

composed of chitin with lipid attachments. Nod factors
communicate with the host plant and help establish species
specificity between bacterium and host.
The entry of the bacteria into the host involves a fascinating interplay between bacterial and plant cells
(Fig. 21.43A). First, a bacterium is attracted by flavonoids
to the surface of a root hair extended by a root epidermal cell
(Fig. 21.43A, step 1). The bacterial Nod factor induces the
root hair to curl around it and ultimately surround the bacterium with plant cell envelope (steps 2 and 3). The bacterium
then induces growth of a tube poking into the plant cell

(step 4). The tube growth is directed by the plant nucleus,
which migrates toward the plant cortex (step 5). As the
tube grows, bacteria proliferate, forming a column of cells
that projects down the tube (steps 6 and 7). This column of
cells is known as the infection thread. The infection thread
can be visualized by light microscopy (Fig. 21.43B).
As the infection thread develops, signals from the bacteria induce the cortical cells (below the epidermis) to prepare
to receive the bacteria. The bacteria induce further tube formation into the cortical cells and continue penetration as
they grow. The penetration of the infection thread into the
cortex is shown in fluorescence micrographs (Fig. 21.43C)
in which the bacteria are engineered to express a fluorescent protein.
The cortical cells invaded by bacteria are induced to
proliferate in an organized manner, forming nodules.

Within the nodules, most of the infecting bacteria differentiate into wall-less bacteroids that will fix nitrogen. A
few bacteria fail to differentiate; their fate is unclear. The
bacteroids remain sequestered within a sac of plant-derived
membrane known as the symbiosome. The symbiosome
membrane contains special transporters that mediate the
exchange of nutrients between the bacteroid and its host
cell, sustaining bacteroid metabolism while preventing
harm to the host.
From the plant cytoplasm, the bacteroid receives catabolites such as malate, which enter the TCA cycle and donate
electrons for respiration. The oxygen for respiration comes
from the plant’s photosynthesis, regulated by leghemoglobin to maintain levels low enough to allow nitrogen fixation (Fig. 21.44). Nitrogen fixation consumes about a
fifth of the plant’s photosynthetic products. As discussed

in Chapter 15, nitrogen is fixed by the nitrogenase enzyme
into ammonium ions:

+

–

N2 + 10H + 8e ⎯→ 2NH4 + H 2
The reaction requires expenditure of eight NADPH or
NADH, plus 16 ATP, which are generated by respiration.
But respiration requires oxygen, which poisons nitrogenase. Thus, oxygen needs to be delivered to the bacteroid
only as needed, and in an amount just enough to run respiration. The oxygen is sequestered and brought to the
bacteroid by leghemoglobin, an iron-bearing plant protein
related to blood hemoglobin.
Overall, the nitrogen fixation symbiosis is kept in balance by several regulatory mechanisms. The presence of
ammonium or nitrate ions inhibits symbiosis and nitrogen fixation. The bacteroids cannot synthesize their own
amino acids; instead, they must provide ammonium to the
plant cytoplasm for assimilation into amino acids, some of
which cycle back to the bacteroid. But what is known of
regulation is dwarfed by the unanswered questions: How
is the infection thread formed? How does the plant allow
infection while preventing uncontrolled growth of bacteria? What determines how much of the plant’s photosynthetic products are harvested by the bacteria? Why is
hydrogen gas released, and how can this loss of potential
energy be prevented? What limits the host specificity of
rhizobia to legumes, and can it be extended to other crop
plants, such as corn? Research on these questions is critical
for agriculture.
Thought Question

21.11 High levels of nitrate or ammonium ion corepress the

expression of Nod factors (see Fig. 21.43). What is the biological advantage of Nod regulation?

We have seen many ways in which bacteria and fungi
interact positively with plants, but other species act as
pathogens. In any environment, pathogens are always outnumbered by the vast community of neutral or helpful
microbes. Nevertheless, when a pathogen does colonize a
plant, its growth can have effects ranging from minimal to
devastating (Fig. 21.45). A relatively harmless plant virus
was associated with a famous historical phenomenon: the
sixteenth-century tulip craze in the Netherlands. The virus
caused streaking of tulip petals (Fig. 21.45A), a pattern
much admired by tulip fanciers. Other viruses, however,
can cause devastating blights and epidemics. (For more on
viruses, see Chapters 6 and 11.)
A pathogenic relative of rhizobia is Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a bacterium whose DNA transforms plant cells to
form crown gall tumors (Fig. 21.45B). A. tumefaciens has
an unusually broad host range, and its natural genetic transformation system has been applied widely for commercial
plant engineering (discussed in Chapter 16). The tumors
remain largely confined and have relatively little effect on
plant growth. Other bacterial pathogens, particularly species of Erwinia and Xanthomonas, severely damage plants.
The most common plant pathogens are fungi. Fungal
diseases such as anthracnose (Fig. 21.45C) cause substantial losses in agriculture, affecting cucumbers, tomatoes,
and other vegetables. Dutch elm disease, which has wiped
out nearly all the native elms of the United States, is caused
by the fungus Ophiostoma novo-ulmi. The fungus is carried by bark beetles, which bore into the xylem, damaging
the plant’s transport vessels and allowing access for fungal
spores.
Some fungal pathogens generate specialized structures
to acquire nutrients from plants. As a hypha grows across
the plant epidermis, its tip can penetrate the plant cell

a haustorium (plural, haustoria) (Fig. 21.46). The haustorium never penetrates the plant cell membrane, thus
avoiding leakage and loss of plant cytoplasm. Instead,
it causes the membrane to invaginate, while expanding
into the volume of the plant cell. The haustorium takes
up nutrients such as sucrose, generated by adjacent chloroplasts. Depending on the species of fungus, haustorial
parasitism can lead to mild growth retardation, or it can
rapidly kill the plant.

MICROBIAL ECOLOGY

863

The soil food web includes a complex range of microbial producers, consumers, predators, decomposers, and
mutualists. Microbial mats and biofilms are complex
multispecies communities of bacteria, fungi, and other
microbes.
Fungi decompose lignin, a complex aromatic tree component that is challenging to digest. Lignin decomposition forms humus.
Certain fungi form symbiotic associations with plant
roots called mycorrhizae. Mycorrhizae transport soil
nutrients among many different kinds of plants.
Wetland soils alternate aerated (dry) with anoxic
(water-saturated) conditions. Anoxic wetland soil favors
methanogenesis. Wetland soils are among the most productive ecosystems.
Endophytes are bacteria or fungi that grow within plant
transport vessels, conferring benefits such as resistance
to pathogens.
Rhizobia induce legume roots to nodulate for nitrogen fixation. The bacteria enter the root as infection
threads. Some of the bacteria enter root cells and develop
into nitrogen-fixing bacteroids, which gain energy from
plant cell respiration but must remain anaerobic.
Plant pathogens include bacteria, fungi, and viruses.
Some pathogens only mildly affect the plant, whereas
others cause devastation. Some fungi invade plants using
haustoria, which grow into the plant cell by penetrating
the cell wall and invaginating the cell membrane to avoid
leakage of cytoplasm.

Concluding Thoughts
This chapter has introduced the challenge of characterizing microbial ecosystems, with the promise and pitfalls of
the metagenomes. We have seen how microbes colonize a
vast array of habitats, from the deserts and oceans to the
roots of plants and the digestive tracts of animals. Microbes
are found from the upper layers of our planet’s atmosphere
down to the deepest rock strata we can reach. Wherever
found, microbes both respond to and modify the environment that surrounds them. Thus, microbes both fill available niches and construct their own. While this chapter has
focused on food webs in local habitats, Chapter 22 takes a
global perspective of microbial ecology and its roles in the
cycling of Earth’s essential elements, such as nitrogen and
iron. We will see how microbes interact with global climate
change and examine the evidence for existence of microbial
life beyond Earth.

What is surprising about finding the
complete nitrification pathway in
Nitrospira?
Since the first description of nitrifying
bacteria in 1892, a central hypothesis
of nitrification research has been that
different microorganisms catalyze
ammonia or nitrite oxidation. Microbiologists speculated about the existence of completely
nitrifying microbes, but no such organism was found for
more than a century. The discovery of Nitrospira species
that complete nitrification was a great surprise, especially
because Nitrospira are widely distributed in nature but were
thought to be merely nitrite oxidizers incapable of ammonia
oxidation.

icrobes throughout the biosphere recycle
carbon, nitrogen, and other elements essential for all life. Through their biochemical
transformations, diverse microbial activities largely
determine the quality of soil, air, and water. Today, all
of these geochemical cycles are altered profoundly
by human activity. But microbes can help us manage
environmental change. From local wastewater treatment to the control of greenhouse gases, microbes
are our hidden partners on Earth. And Earth’s microbial cycles lead us to wonder whether biospheres
exist on other worlds.

How will this discovery revise our view of the global
nitrogen cycle?
Nitrification is a key process of the nitrogen cycle in all oxic
ecosystems. The identification of complete nitrifiers, which
were overlooked for decades, means that current concepts
of nitrifier ecology and physiology need a thorough reevaluation. We should take this into account in future studies of
microbial ecology, agriculture, wastewater treatment, and
global climate change research.

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

The global cycle of nitrogen impacts every form of life on
Earth, and we invest vast resources in nitrogen fertilizers
for agriculture. Much of the nitrogen cycle depends on
microbes. We continue to discover unexpected microbial
contributors, such as the Nitrospira species that oxidize
ammonia all the way to nitrate (see the Current Research
Highlight). Nitrate is a key form of nitrogen that living
organisms may assimilate. Surprisingly, we find nitrate on
the planet Mars—suggesting a possible source of nitrogen
for life, if it should (or did) exist there.
The challenge of global cycles is quantification, adding
up all the inputs and outputs of key molecules. Ammonia oxidation is important to quantify because one of the
pathway’s intermediate forms is nitrous oxide (N2O), one
of three major greenhouse gases whose increase correlates
with the industrial age (Fig. 22.1). Greenhouse gases trap
solar radiation as heat—an effect known as the greenhouse
effect. Levels of these gases from thousands of years ago are
measured from air bubbles trapped in ice in Antarctica. The
gases are generated by bacteria, methanogens, and other
life-forms, but human technology accelerates their release.
Burning petroleum releases CO2 from a product that
bacteria and plants took millions of years to form. At the
same time, phototrophic bacteria and plants fix much of the
global carbon dioxide into biomass. But the added human
output of CO2 has outpaced the rate of plant and microbial
CO2 fixation. Global warming accelerates methane release
by methanogens. And bacteria oxidize sewage nitrogen to
N2O. Will the human-induced global climate change cause
mass extinctions of a majority of Earth’s species—as did

22.1

Biogeochemical Cycles

Two billion years ago, ancient cyanobacteria began to photolyze water and produce molecular oxygen, as discussed in
Chapter 17. Oxygen is a powerful oxidant, lethal to most life
in that anoxic era, when all living organisms were anaerobic
microbes. To survive, anaerobes had to evolve mechanisms
of protection against oxygen, such as antioxidant molecules
and enzymes, or else retreat to anoxic habitats. Since then,
microbes have shaped our biosphere by releasing oxygen, by
fixing nitrogen and returning it to the atmosphere, and by
fixing and producing carbon dioxide. These and countless
other microbial processes have made Earth’s atmosphere what
it is, and they continue their roles in its homeostasis.

the rise of ancient cyanobacteria? Or can we use our knowledge of microbial ecology to channel microbial activities
into recovering the balance—for example, by increasing
microbial CO2 fixation?
Throughout most of this book, we present microbial biochemistry in the context of growth of individual organisms.
Here in Chapter 22, we show how the collective metabolic
activities of microbial populations contribute to global cycles
of elements throughout Earth’s biosphere. We consider the
ways that we humans enlist microbes for bioremediation,
the use of microbial metabolism to reverse pollution and
restore chemical cycles, such as the water cycle in the Florida Everglades (see Section 22.3). Finally, we explore how
our awareness of global microbiology has renewed our quest
for life beyond Earth. For example, the discovery of nitrate
on Mars shows the surprising possibility of nitrogen “fertilizer” available for life on that planet (see Section 22.6).

Microbes Cycle Essential Elements

Microbes have exceptional abilities to interconvert molecules (discussed in Chapter 21). But even microbes face the
limits of the actual elements themselves: No metabolism
can convert one element to another. Because organisms
cannot form their own elements, they need to get them
from their environment. While small amounts of matter
enter the biosphere from outer space, and gases continually
escape Earth, the rates of these changes are tiny compared
to the rates of living processes. So, organisms acquire their
elements either from nonliving components of their environment, such as by fixing atmospheric CO2, or from other
organisms, by grazing, predation, or decomposition. Furthermore, all organisms recycle their components back to
the biosphere. The partners in this recycling include abiotic
entities such as air, water, and minerals, as well as biotic
entities such as predators and decomposers. Collectively,

components such as the silicate shells of diatoms or the sulfur
granules of phototrophic bacteria. All of these elements flow
in biogeochemical cycles of nutrients throughout the biotic
and abiotic components of the biosphere. The environmental
levels of key elements can limit biological productivity. For
example, the concentration of iron can limit marine populations of phytoplankton, which depend on iron supplied by
wind blowing dust off a land mass. Other elements, such as
zinc and copper, are micronutrients, nutrients required in
still smaller amounts. Micronutrients, too, must be cycled,
although their flux is challenging to measure.

Sources and Sinks of
Essential Elements

the metabolic interactions of microbial communities with
the biotic and abiotic components of their ecosystems are
known as biogeochemistry or geomicrobiology.
Which elements need to be recycled and made available
for life? In most organisms, six elements predominate: carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur (discussed in Chapter 4). Table 22.1 summarizes the
elemental composition typical of Gram-negative bacteria.
In other microbes, elemental proportions vary with species and growth conditions. Some species include inorganic

Biogeochemical cycles include both biological components
(such as phototrophs that consume CO2 and heterotrophs
that release CO2) and geological components (such as volcanoes that release CO2 and oceans that absorb CO2). The
major parts of the biosphere containing significant amounts
of an element needed for life are called reservoirs of that
element (Table 22.2). Each reservoir acts both as a source
of that element for living organisms and as a sink to which
the element returns. For example, the ocean is an important reservoir for carbon (CO2 in equilibrium with HCO3 –,
bicarbonate ion). The ocean’s carbon cycles rapidly; thus,
the ocean serves as both a source and a sink for carbon.
As elements cycle from sources to sinks, microbial
metabolism generates a series of redox changes (discussed
in Chapter 14). The major oxidation states of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur are summarized in Table 22.3. Biospheric

is excreted by many organisms in its most reduced form,
ammonia (NH3), which is protonated to ammonium ion
(NH4+). Ammonium is oxidized by lithotrophic bacteria through several stages to nitrite (NO2 –) and nitrate
(NO3 –), which serve as terminal electron acceptors for
anaerobic respiration. Sulfides (H 2S, HS –) serve as electron donors for respiration and sulfur phototrophy, whereas
oxidized forms, such as sulfite (SO32–) and sulfate (SO42–),

To measure environmental carbon, nitrogen, and other
elements, various methods are used. These methods fall
under the following categories:
■

Chemical and spectroscopic analysis. Bulk quantities
of CO2, nitrates, and other chemicals can be determined
by sophisticated chemical instrumentation. Atmospheric
CO2 is measured by infrared absorption spectroscopy,
applied to samples from towers such as those of the
NASA FLUXNET study (Fig. 22.2). Gas chromatography is used to separate and quantify various gases,
including oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur dioxide, and carbon
monoxide. Mass spectrometry detects extremely small
quantities of different molecules, even distinguishing
between elemental isotopes.

■

Radioisotope incorporation. The influx and efflux of
CO2 can be measured by the uptake of 14C-labeled substrates in a small, controlled model ecosystem called a
mesocosm. Alternatively, CO2 flux can be measured with
radioisotope tracers in the field using a field chamber.

■

Stable isotope ratios. Some enzyme reactions show
a preference for one isotope over another, such as 14N
versus 15N. For example, denitrifiers (bacteria that
metabolize nitrate) strongly prefer the 14N isotope, leaving behind nitrate enriched in 15N. The 14N/15N ratio
is measured using mass spectrometry. Measuring nitrogen isotope ratios can indicate whether denitrifiers could
have conducted metabolism in the sample.

22.1 Why is oxidation state critical for the acquisition,
usability, and potential toxicity of cycled compounds? Cite
examples based on your study of microbial metabolism
(see Chapter 14).

How do we study microbial cycling on a global scale?
How do we figure out whether ecosystems are net sources
or sinks of CO2? Does microbial activity enhance or limit
availability of nitrogen? Rates of flux of elements in the
biosphere are very difficult to measure, yet the questions
have enormous political and economic implications.

Most flux measurements apply to gases, which are the
easiest forms to sample, but the data leave unanswered
many questions about the deep ocean and subsurface. Subsurface studies require drilling for samples, or more exotic
kinds of remote sensing such as airborne imaging of magnetic resistivity to reveal underground hydrology in Antarctica (described in Special Topic 22.1).

To Summarize
■

■

■

Microbes cycle essential elements in the biosphere.
Many key cycling reactions are performed only by bacteria and archaea.
Elements cycle between organisms and abiotic
sources and sinks. The most accessible source of carbon and nitrogen is the atmosphere. Earth’s crust stores
large amounts of key elements, but their availability to
organisms is limited.
Environmental flux of elements is measured
through chemistry. Methods include infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, gas chromatography,

radioisotope incorporation, and the measurement of
isotope ratios.

22.2

The Carbon Cycle and
Bioremediation

The foundation of all food webs involves influx and efflux
of carbon. The major reservoirs of carbon are shown in
Table 22.2. In theory, carbonate rock forms the largest
reservoir of carbon. But Earth’s crust is the source least
accessible to the biosphere as a whole. Crustal rock provides
carbon only to organisms at the surface and to subsurface
microbes that grow extremely slowly. Thus, subsurface carbon turnover is very slow. The carbon reservoir that cycles
most rapidly is that of the atmosphere, a source of CO2
for photosynthesis and chemolithoautotrophy. The atmosphere also acts as a sink for CO2 produced by heterotrophy
and by geological outgassing from volcanoes.
The atmospheric reservoir is much smaller than other
sources, such as the oceans, crustal rock, and fossil fuels.
For this reason, the industrial burning of fossil fuels has

Microbial communities shape our planet’s geology and geochemistry in surprising ways. From a glacier in the Antarctic
Taylor Valley spurts a bizarre red stream known as Blood Falls
(Fig. 1). For several years, Jill Mikucki and her students from
the University of Tennessee–Knoxville have investigated Blood
Falls and its mysterious microbial inhabitants. The microbes
turn out to be lithotrophs, reducing iron (Shewanella frigidimarina) or oxidizing sulfur (Thiomicrospira arctica). These iron
and sulfur metabolizers are also halophiles, growing in iron-rich
brine. The brine concentrated over 5 million years from ancient
marine water that once flowed there. The halophilic iron and
sulfur metabolizers fix CO2 into biomass by chemosynthesis, a
process that plays a role in our planet’s carbon budget.
But where does the Blood Falls brine come from? Mikucki
hypothesized that a subsurface river of brine flows deep
beneath the glaciers and permafrost of Taylor Valley, rising to
the surface only at the edge of Taylor Glacier. To gain evidence
for this model, Mikucki used an airborne sensor for electrical resistivity, a property that increases as water freezes but
decreases with salt concentration. A giant airborne electromagnetic sensor (Fig. 2A) was carried by helicopter above
the length and breadth of Taylor Valley (Fig. 2B). Traveling
A.
back and forth, the sensor mapped
electrical resistivity of the geological
strata below the lakes (Fig. 2C). The
mapping showed a dramatic drop in
electrical resistivity in sediments 500
meters below the glacier surface, indicating salt-saturated groundwater. But
this layer of brine rises dramatically at
the glacier’s forward edge, emerging
to the surface at Blood Falls. Thus, the
concentrated remains of a million-yearold river flow underground, bearing
with them a vast community of iron and
sulfur bacteria. The existence of such a
community suggests a possible mode
of existence for subsurface microbes
on the planet Mars.

perturbed the balance between atmospheric CO2 and
larger reservoirs, such as the ocean. The ocean actually
absorbs a good part of the extra CO2, in equilibrium with
carbonates; and microbial photosynthesis traps carbon in
biomass. But despite the ocean’s carbon capture, atmospheric CO2 continues to increase at an annual rate of
2 parts per million (ppm). This is twice the rate observed
in the past century, during the decade of the 1960s. Thus,
atmospheric CO2 is rising at an ever-faster rate. In 2013,
the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii measured a level of
CO2 at 400 ppm—believed to be the highest level on Earth
for the past 3 million years.
On land, terrestrial plants, particularly forest trees,
sequester significant amounts of carbon—perhaps 10%–
20% of the CO2 released by burning fossil fuels. Forest carbon sequestration is shown in the international FLUXNET
data (Fig. 22.2B). This experiment compares the seasonal
patterns of net CO2 uptake (the negative values on the
y-axis) for forests at four different latitudes. It shows that
the higher the latitude of the forest, the later in summer its
CO2 uptake peaks. Such measurements provide the basis
for modeling global climate change, and for negotiating
agreements to “trade” pollution for forest growth.
Note, however, that being a greenhouse gas does not
make CO2 inherently “bad” for the environment. In fact, if
heterotrophic production of CO2 were to cease altogether,
phototrophs would run out of CO2 in roughly 300 years,

despite the vast quantities of carbon present in the ocean
and crust. Thus, both CO2 fixers and heterotrophs need
each other for a continuous cycle.

Carbon Cycles Depend on Oxygen

The global cycle of carbon in the biosphere is closely linked
to the cycles of oxygen and hydrogen, elements to which
most carbon is bonded. Overall, carbon cycles between carbon dioxide (CO2) and various reduced forms of carbon,
including biomass (living material). Note that the results of
carbon cycling differ greatly, depending on the presence of
molecular oxygen.
Marine carbon cycling. The largest aerated ecosystem is the
photic zone of oceans (Fig. 22.3A). In the aerated (or oxic)
habitat of the marine photic zone, the ecosystem absorbs
enough light for the rate of photosynthesis to exceed the
rate of heterotrophy. Photosynthesis drives what is called the
biological carbon pump. Microbial and plant photosynthesis fi xes CO2 into biomass, designated by the shorthand
[CH 2O]. Phototrophs include bacteria and protists. Marine
phototrophs such as diatoms and coccolithophores trap a
substantial amount of carbon in biomass (Fig. 22.3B). A
portion of their biomass sinks to the ocean floor through
the weight of their silicate or carbonate exoskeletons. Photosynthetic CO2 fi xation is accompanied by release of O2.

■ The terrestrial carbon cycle: aerobic and anaerobic. A. Aerobic and anaerobic conversions of carbon. Blue =
reduction of carbon; red = oxidation of carbon; orange = fermentation; [CH2O] = organic biomass. In an aerobic environment (top),
photosynthesis generates molecular oxygen (O2), which enables the most efficient metabolism by heterotrophs, methanotrophs, and
lithotrophs. B. Cortinarius armillatus mushrooms are fruiting bodies of mycorrhizal fungi that share mutualism with birch trees. Inset: Karina
Clemmensen studies mycorrhizal sequestration of carbon.

The O2 is then used by heterotrophs (such as bacteria,
protists, and animals) to convert biomass [CH 2O] back to
CO2. In the presence of light, a net excess of O2 is released.
Biomass is also produced through lithotrophy or chemolithoautotrophy—the oxidation of hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, ferrous iron (Fe2+) and other reduced minerals, and
even carbon monoxide.
Terrestrial carbon cycling: aerobic. Another large aerobic

habitat is the oxygenated layer of soil (discussed in Chapter 21) (Fig. 22.4A, top). While plants perform most of
the terrestrial photosynthesis, microbial phototrophs also
fi x CO2 into biomass. Microbial lithotrophy fi xes carbon in
soil and in weathered areas of crustal rock. Lithotrophy is
performed solely by bacteria and archaea, essential microbial partners in these ecosystems. Unlike photosynthesis,
lithotrophy usually consumes O2 instead of producing it.
Much carbon is stored as carbon polymers such as cellulose
and lignin. But microbial and animal consumers release a
lot of CO2 through respiration.
In 2013, another important microbial carbon sink was
discovered by Karina Clemmensen, Björn Lindahl, and

colleagues at Uppsala BioCenter, Sweden: the mycorrhizal fungi (presented in Chapter 21). Mycorrhizal fungi
(Fig. 22.4B) form mutualistic associations with forest
plant roots and are especially important for the roots of
trees. Clemmensen showed that in some forests, the roots
and fungi can sequester as much as 22 kilograms of carbon per square meter of forest soil, which may be 70% of
the total carbon sequestered. Thus, mycorrhizal fungi play
an important role in minimizing release of the greenhouse
gas CO2.
Anaerobic carbon cycling. Anoxic environments support
lower rates of biomass production than do oxygen-rich
environments because they depend on oxidants of lower
redox potential and limited quantity, such as Fe3+. Anaerobic conversion of CO2 to biomass is done mainly by bacteria and archaea. Vast, permanently anaerobic habitats
extend several kilometers below Earth’s surface, encompassing a greater volume than the rest of the biosphere put
together (Fig. 22.4A, bottom). In these habitats, endolithic bacteria inhabit the interstices of rock crystals (discussed in Chapter 21).

In soil and water, anaerobic metabolism includes fermentation of organic carbon sources, as well as respiration and lithotrophy with alternative electron acceptors
such as nitrate, ferric iron (Fe3+), and sulfate. Anaerobic
decomposition by microbes is one stage in the formation
of fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas (primarily methane). In soil, anoxic conditions (extremely low in O2) favor
incomplete breakdown of organic material. This characteristic of anaerobic soil actually enriches ecosystems, particularly those of wetlands, which undergo periodic cycles
of aeration and hydration. The partly decomposed matter
becomes available for further decomposition. Anoxic environments favor production of methane from the H 2, CO2,
and other fermentation products of anaerobes.
A major source of concern for global greenhouse gases is
the methane hydrates accumulating in deep marine sediments,
generated by huge benthic communities of methanogens
(discussed in Chapters 19 and 21). Warming of methane
hydrate releases gaseous methane. Some methane is oxidized by methanotrophs, but an unknown amount rises to
the atmosphere (Fig. 22.5). Geological evidence suggests
that rapid methane release accompanied the retreat of the
glaciers during ice age transitions. A rapid methane release
today could accelerate global warming.
At the ocean floor, many of the methane hydrates are
oxidized by microbial mats of sulfate-reducing bacteria and
anaerobic methane-oxidizing archaea (ANME), discussed
in Section 19.4. The sulfate reducers plus the methane oxidizers conduct a syntrophic reaction, for which the overall
∆G value is negative:
CH4 + SO42– ⎯→ HCO3 – + HS – + H 2O
In this metabolism, methane is the initial electron donor
oxidized by the ANME partner, and sulfate is the terminal
electron acceptor reduced by the bacteria. The high sulfate concentration of marine water drives this reaction in

anoxic sediment, where all of the O2 has been consumed by
microbes that oxidize upwelling reduced minerals (such as
sulfide oxidizers at thermal vents and cold seeps, discussed
in Chapter 21).
In 2012, researchers reported a different source of
marine methane, from aerated water: the aerobic ammoniaoxidizing archaea, such as Nitrosopumilus (discussed in
Chapter 19). William W. Metcalf and colleagues at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign showed that
Nitrosopumilus species conduct reactions that degrade toxic
phosphonates, organic compounds containing a direct
carbon-phosphorus bond. The reactions release methylphosphonate, a compound that many kinds of bacteria
convert to methane in order to acquire the scarce phosphate for phospholipids and nucleic acids. In addition, the
sequence of the Nitrosopumilus enzyme for methylphosphonate production revealed homologs in the Global Ocean
Sampling Expedition (GOS) metagenome—for example, in
the bacterium Pelagibacter. Thus, both archaeal and bacterial methylphosphonate may be sources of methane from
aerated habitats.

The Global Carbon Balance

What determines atmospheric levels of CO2? The global balance of biological CO2 fixation and release largely determines the level of CO2. Since the beginning of the industrial
age, however, the release of CO2 has accelerated significantly.
The major part of this increase comes from the combustion
of fossil fuels, which adds about 6 × 1015 grams of carbon
annually to the atmosphere. Fossil fuels are the product of
microbial anaerobic digestion of plant and animal remains,
reduced to hydrocarbons by the pressure and heat of Earth’s
crust. When burned as fuel, carbon that had accumulated
over millions of years is rapidly returned to the atmosphere
as CO2. Increased CO2 fixation and ocean absorption compensate for some of the CO2 flux, but about a tenth of the
carbon remains in the atmosphere.
Another factor in the increase of atmospheric CO2 is
microbial decomposition in the soil (discussed in Chapter 21). Microbes release carbon through respiration
(aerobic and anaerobic), as well as fermentation in anoxic
strata, and methanogenesis. A major concern today is the
increased rate of microbial activity in Arctic permafrost as
temperatures increase. The Arctic permafrost is estimated
to store more than twice the amount of carbon that is in the
atmosphere. As permafrost melts, so do methane hydrates
from methane produced earlier by methanogens. In 2012,
Andrew McDougall and colleagues at the University of
Victoria (British Columbia) modeled both the response of
permafrost carbon release and its feedback effect on global
warming. They project that permafrost could release more
than a quarter of its carbon stores by the year 2100, and

876

that this amount could add another 1.5°C to the global
temperature by the year 2300. The microbial release of
methane and CO2 could increase the rate of global warming, which in turn thaws the permafrost faster.
The contribution of ocean ecosystems to carbon flux is
even more difficult to measure. Studies of carbon and oxygen flux based on isotope ratios suggest a much greater level
of biological production than earlier estimates suggested.
The oceans conduct more than half of the global biological uptake of carbon from the atmosphere. Metagenomic
surveys are revealing previously unrecognized communities
of marine phototrophs, such as submicroscopic cyanobacteria, the prochlorophytes (Prochlorococcus species). In the
deep ocean, similar studies reveal new methane-oxidizing
archaea (ANME) that play a critical role in removing benthic methane hydrates.
From a political standpoint, ecosystems such as forests
that act as carbon sinks by fixing carbon into stable biomass
are considered desirable because they lessen the rate of CO2
input into the atmosphere. Ecosystems that act as sources
of carbon dioxide may be viewed with disfavor because they
contribute to global warming. But what if CO2-generating ecosystems provide other environmental benefits? For
example, wetlands are among Earth’s most productive ecosystems, supporting vast amounts of plant and animal life,
although they also release significant amounts of CO2 and
methane. An example of research on wetland carbon cycles
is presented in eTopic 22.1.

The most accessible carbon reservoir is the atmosphere (CO2). Atmospheric carbon is severely perturbed
by the burning of fossil fuels.
Cyanobacteria and other phytoplankton cycle much
of biospheric CO2 and release O2. Oxygen released by
phototrophs is used by aerobic heterotrophs and lithotrophs. Marine plankton, as well as terrestrial trees and
mycorrhizal fungi, serve as major carbon sinks.
Anaerobic environments cycle carbon through bacteria and archaea. Bacteria conduct fermentation and
anaerobic respiration, while methanogens convert CO2
and H 2 to methane. Methane is oxidized to CO2 by
methane-oxidizing bacteria and archaea.
In oxygenated water, bacteria may release methane
via methylphosphonate.
Microbial decomposition returns CO2 to the atmosphere. Microbial decomposition is the main source of
accelerated CO2 flux from the soil, especially from melting permafrost.

22.3

The Hydrologic Cycle and
Wastewater Treatment

The fate and distribution of complex carbon compounds
are largely functions of the hydrologic cycle, or water
cycle, the cyclic exchange of water between atmospheric
water vapor and Earth’s ecosystems (Fig. 22.6A). A vast
reservoir of water is supplied by the ocean. In the hydrologic cycle, water precipitates as rain, which is drawn by
gravity into groundwater, rivers, lakes, and ultimately the
ocean. All along this route, of course, evaporation returns
water to the air. Human communities interact with the
hydrologic cycle by drawing water for drinking and other
purposes, and by returning wastewater. Before wastewater
can be safely returned to the hydrologic cycle, organic contaminants must be removed. Key parts of that treatment
are performed by microbes.

Biochemical Oxygen Demand

What determines the health of an aquatic ecosystem? As
discussed in Chapter 21, a major factor in the health of ecosystems is the balance between the level of oxygen and the
levels of reduced organic nutrients. Organic contamination
destabilizes marine, freshwater, and terrestrial ecosystems.
Water passing through the ground and aquatic ecosystems
carries organic carbon material from humus, sewage, and
fertilizer runoff. A sudden influx of rich carbon substrates
accelerates respiration by aquatic microbes. Microbial respiration then competes with respiration by fish, invertebrates,
and amphibians for the limited supply of oxygen dissolved
in water, raising the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD),
also called the biological oxygen demand (BOD). The
higher the concentration of organic substances, the higher
the BOD arising from microbial oxygen consumption.
High BOD can cause a massive die-off of fish and other
aquatic animals. Thus, a routine part of monitoring the
health of lakes and streams is the measurement of BOD. A
standard value of BOD is defined by measuring the rate of
oxygen uptake in a water sample by a defined set of heterotrophic bacteria (Fig. 22.6B). Oxygen uptake is observed
in a BOD analyzer (Fig. 22.6C), which detects dissolved
oxygen in water. The rate of decrease of dissolved oxygen
measured by the BOD analyzer is approximately proportional to the amount of dissolved organic matter available
for respiration. Note, however, that the BOD in a natural
environment will depend on the microbes actually present,
as well as the plants and animals competing for oxygen and
other resources.
Until recently, BOD was considered a local issue, affecting the health of lakes and rivers in a community. But today

we recognize huge impacts of rising BOD in the oceans
(Fig. 22.7). Ocean oxygen levels are high near the surface,
where phototrophs release oxygen, but organic nutrients
are so scarce that respiration is limited. Oxygen is also high
in the deep benthos, because most organic nutrients have
been consumed, and because the sheer volume of water
can hold dissolved oxygen in large amounts. But near the
coastal shelf, currents may carry sediment up to a middle
region where organic nutrients meet the oxygen. This combination supports rapid bacterial respiration. The result is
an oxygen minimum zone (OMZ), a region of low or
near-zero oxygen sandwiched between the upper and lower
oxygenated layers. Above and below the anoxic water, there
is a steep oxycline (gradient of oxygen concentration). A
well-known OMZ is located off the coast of Oregon, where
crabs and other animals are found dying as they try to
escape asphyxiation.
Oxygen minimum zones are worsened by increasing
temperatures, which accelerate respiration, and by influx of
sewage and agricultural waste. The zone expands upward

toward the surface and downward to the sediment, trapping crabs and fish. Today, large regions of ocean have
become dead zones, or zones of hypoxia, devoid of most
fish and invertebrates. A major dead zone is a region in the
Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana where the Mississippi River releases about 40% of the U.S. drainage to
the sea (Fig. 22.8A). Over its long, meandering course,
which includes inputs from the Ohio and Missouri rivers,
the Mississippi builds up high levels of organic pollutants,
as well as nitrates from agricultural fertilizer. When these
nitrogen-rich substances flow rapidly out to the Gulf in the
spring, they lift the nitrogen limitation on algal growth
and feed massive algal blooms. The algal population then
crashes, and their sedimenting cells are consumed by heterotrophic bacteria. The heterotrophs use up the available
oxygen, causing hypoxia. Hypoxia kills off the fish, shellfish, and crustaceans over a region equivalent in size to the
state of New Jersey.
In 2010 the Gulf of Mexico dead zone was expanded by
the unprecedented spill of oil from the Deepwater Horizon

oil well blowout (Fig. 22.8B). The offshore oil platform
exploded, releasing millions of barrels of oil into the Gulf
over 3 months. The leaked oil killed wildlife throughout the
Gulf, causing unprecedented environmental damage. Workers tried to contain the spill, but ultimately most of the oil
was consumed by marine bacteria. Only bacteria and archaea
possess the enzymes needed to degrade the complex organic
mixture of petroleum, which includes waxy aromatic compounds such as paraffins (discussed in Chapter 21). Many of
the pollutants were metabolized to CO2 by oil-eating bacteria that feed naturally on oil seeping slowly from the Gulf
sediment. But the sudden large input of oil raised microbial
respiration and BOD levels throughout the Gulf, thus lowering oxygen available to wildlife. Furthermore, certain oil
components linger in the environment for decades, including toxins such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).
Dead zones now occur along the coasts of industrial
and developing countries throughout the world, including
India and Australia. Dead zones deplete habitat for much
marine life—for example, forcing sharks to swim out of
hypoxic regions and nearer the shore. Dead zones contribute to the crash of fisheries worldwide, removing a critical
food resource for human populations. To avoid such dead
zones, release of industrial pollutants and fertilizers must
be prevented. In addition, all the communities throughout
the river drainage areas must treat their wastes to eliminate
nitrogenous wastes before disposal.

There are two common approaches to community wastewater treatment, both of which involve microbial partners:
wastewater treatment plants and wetland filtration. Both
approaches depend on microbes to remove organic carbon
and nitrogen from water before it returns to aquatic systems and ultimately the ocean.

Wastewater Treatment

In industrialized nations, all municipal communities use
some form of wastewater treatment (Fig. 22.9). The
purpose of wastewater treatment is to decrease the BOD
and the level of human pathogens before water is returned
to local rivers. The treatment process includes microbial
metabolism. A modern wastewater treatment plant can
convert sewage into water that exceeds all government
standards for humans to drink.
The wastewater treatment plant is the final destination for
all household and industrial liquid wastes passing through
the municipal sewage system. A typical plant includes the
following stages of treatment, illustrated in Fig. 22.9A:
■

Preliminary treatment consists of screens that remove
solid debris, such as sticks, dead animals, and feminine
hygiene items.

■

Primary treatment includes fine screens and sedimentation tanks that remove insoluble particles. The particles

eventually are recombined with the solid products of
wastewater treatment to form what is known as sludge.
The sludge ultimately is used for fertilizer or landfill.
■

Secondary treatment consists primarily of microbial
ecosystems that decompose the soluble organic content
of wastewater, by aerobic and anaerobic respiration. The
nutrient removal process may include biological removal
of nitrogen and phosphorus. If included at this point,
nitrogen is removed by nitrifying bacteria that oxidize
ammonium, and phosphorus is removed by polyphosphate-accumulating bacteria. The microbes form particulate flocs of biofilm. The flocs are sedimented as
sludge, also known as activated sludge, owing to their
microbial activity.

■

Tertiary (advanced) treatment includes fi ltration of
particulates from the microbial flocs of secondary treatment, and may include chemical processes to decrease
nitrogen and phosphorus. The fi nal step involves disinfection to eliminate pathogens, usually by a chemical
process such as chlorination. The treated water is then
returned to local freshwater sources.

The microbial ecosystems of secondary treatment require
continual aeration to maximize breakdown of molecules to
carbon dioxide and nitrates. The floc size and composition
must be monitored for optimal performance. Floc microbes
typically include bacilli such as Zoogloea, Flavobacterium,
and Pseudomonas, as well as filamentous species such as
Nocardia (Fig. 22.10A). Optimal treatment depends on
the ratio of filamentous to single-celled bacteria: enough
filaments to hold together the flocs for sedimentation, but
not so many as to trap air and cause flocs to float and foam,
preventing sedimentation.
Besides bacteria, the ecosystem of activated sludge
includes filamentous methanogens (discussed in Chapter 19), which metabolize short-chain molecules such as
acetate within the anaerobic interior of flocs. Thus, wastewater treatment generates methane, often in quantities that
can be recovered as fuel.
In addition, the bacteria are preyed upon by protists
such as stalked ciliates (Fig. 22.10B), swimming ciliates, and amebas, as well as invertebrates such as rotifers
and nematodes. The predators serve the valuable function of limiting the numbers of planktonic single-celled

Thought Question

22.2 What would happen if wastewater treatment lacked microbial predators? Why would the result be harmful?

Wastewater treatment plants are remarkably effective
at converting human wastes to ecologically safe water and
ultimately human drinking water. The plants are, however,

impractical for purifying the runoff from large agricultural
operations. For large-scale alternatives to treatment plants,
communities and agricultural operations are looking to
wetland restoration. Much of our current water supply is
already filtered and purified by natural wetlands, such as
the Florida Everglades (Fig. 22.11A). Wetlands remove
nitrogen through the action of denitrifying bacteria. In
wetlands, rainwater and river water trickle slowly through
vast stretches of soil, where microbial conversion acts as the
foundation of a macroscopic ecosystem including trees and
vertebrates. Thus, much of the carbon and nitrogen is fixed
into valuable biomass. In the wetlands of the Everglades,
the remaining water filters slowly through limestone into

underground aquifers, which ultimately provide water
through wells to human communities.
Some agricultural operations are building artificial
wetlands to replace treatment plants. Figure 22.11B
shows a hog farm where a series of terraced wetlands was
built to drain liquefied manure. The wetlands were found
to produce fewer odors and to remove organics more efficiently and at a lower cost than do traditional filtration
plants.
A much greater challenge is that of industrial runoff, in
which toxic wastes from factory chemistry enter an aquifer,
at levels endangering human health. These chemicals may
poison the treatment plants designed for human effluents.
Large regions of land surrounding such a plant may require
remediation that is expensive or impractical. And traces of
pollutants such as chlorinated aromatics reach every spot
on the globe; for example, dioxins are found in the tissues
of Antarctic penguins.
How can we remediate industrial pollutants before
they poison the local countryside and spread throughout the globe? One way is to harness naturally occurring
bacteria for bioremediation. The bacterial community’s reaction rate can be enhanced through selection
by enrichment culture (described in Chapter 4). In the
culture, organisms from the polluted site are cultivated
repeatedly in the presence of added pollutant, and then
tested for activity using radiolabeled substrates. An
example of successful bioremediation is the case of Aberdeen Proving Ground, where a microbial mat was used
to catabolize chlorinated hydrocarbons left by weapons
manufacture (eTopic 22.2).

The hydrologic cycle is the cyclic exchange of water
between the atmosphere and the biosphere. Water
precipitates as rain, which enters the ground and ultimately flows to the oceans. Along the way, some of the
water evaporates, returning to the atmosphere.
Water carries organic carbon that generates biochemical oxygen demand (BOD). High BOD accelerates heterotrophic respiration and depletes oxygen
needed by fish.
Oxygen minimum zones are hypoxic regions of ocean
sandwiched between upper and lower oxygenated
layers. Low oxygen levels are found at middle depth,
where the oxygen from phototrophs meets upwelling
organic nutrients.
Dead zones occur where sewage and agricultural
runoff expand the oxygen minimum zones. Dead
zones exclude all aerobic life.
Wastewater treatment cuts down BOD. Secondary
treatment involves formation of flocs, microbial communities that decompose the soluble organic content.
Wetlands filter water naturally. Wetland filtration
helps purify groundwater entering aquifers.
Industrial effluents are highly toxic and can reach all
parts of the globe. Bioremediation with microbes may
eliminate such toxins.

Sources of Nitrogen

The Nitrogen Cycle

Besides carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen, another major element that cycles largely by microbial conversion is nitrogen (Fig. 22.12). The nitrogen cycle is notable in three
respects:
■

Many oxidation states. A larger number of oxidation
states exist for biological nitrogen than for any other
major biological element (see Table 22.3). Conversion
between these oxidation states requires metabolic processes such as N2 fixation, lithotrophy, and anaerobic
respiration.

■

Dependence on prokaryotes. Many steps of the nitrogen cycle require bacteria and archaea. Without bacteria
and archaea, the nitrogen cycle would not exist.

■

Extreme perturbation by human technology. Half
the nitrogen in the biosphere now comes from anthropogenic (human-generated) sources.

Where is nitrogen found on Earth? As we saw for carbon,
a significant amount of nitrogen is found in Earth’s crust,
in the form of ammonium salts in rock (see Table 22.2).
Unlike crustal carbon, however, the nitrogen found in
rock is largely inaccessible to microbes. The major accessible source of nitrogen is the atmosphere, of which dinitrogen gas (N2) constitutes 79%. However, N2 is a highly
stable molecule that requires an enormous input of reducing energy before assimilation is possible (see Chapter 15).
Thus, for many natural ecosystems, and most forms of
agriculture, nitrogen is the limiting nutrient for primary
productivity.
Until recently in Earth’s history, nitrogen was fixed
entirely by nitrogen-fixing bacteria and archaea. In the
twentieth century, however, the Haber process was invented
for artificial nitrogen fixation to generate fertilizers for
agriculture. The process was devised by German chemist
Fritz Haber, who won the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. In the Haber process, N2 is hydrogenated by methane
under extreme heat and pressure. Today, the Haber process
for producing fertilizers accounts for approximately 30%–
50% of all nitrogen fixed on Earth. Other human activities, such as fuel burning and use of nitrogenous fertilizers,
contribute to oxidized nitrogen pollutants such as nitrous
oxide (N2O), a potent greenhouse gas.

Because of extensive fertilizer use, the nitrogen cycle
today is the most perturbed of the major biogeochemical
cycles. The ultimate effects of perturbation are not yet clear.
Some models show that increased nitrogen fixation could
fertilize CO2 fixation by marine and terrestrial ecosystems,
partly decreasing net CO2 emissions. The amount, however,
will be too small to prevent global warming. Other models
show that accelerated nitrogen use could limit nitrogen availability in the global biosphere, with unknown consequences.

We will consider in turn the three sides of the nitrogen
triangle:
■

■

The “Nitrogen Triangle”

The numerous oxidation states available for microbial
metabolism of nitrogen generate a complex cycle of conversions. One way to organize the complexity is to envision a
“nitrogen triangle” whose corners include three key forms:
atmospheric N2; the reduced forms NH3 and NH4+; and
the oxidized forms NO2 – and NO3 – (Fig. 22.13A). At the
base of the triangle, both reduced and oxidized forms of
nitrogen are assimilated into biomass.

Thought Question

22.4 The nitrogen cycle has to be linked with the carbon
cycle, since both contribute to biomass. How might the carbon
cycle of an ecosystem be affected by increased input of
nitrogen?

■

N2 fixation to ammonium (NH4+), a form assimilated
into biomass by microbes and plants.
Ammonia oxidation, in which ammonia (NH3) is
oxidized aerobically to nitrite (NO2 –) and nitrate
(NO3 –), which are also assimilated by microbes and
plants. Aerobic oxidation to nitrite or nitrate is called
nitrification. In the absence of oxygen gas, anaerobic
ammonium oxidation by nitrite generates N2 —a reaction called anammox.
Denitrification of NO2 – and NO3 – back to N2 (or, in
carbon-rich habitats, reduction to NH3).

Nitrogen fixation. The main avenue for entry of nitrogen into the biosphere is bacterial and archaeal nitrogen
fi xation—specifically, fi xation of dinitrogen, or nitrogen gas (N2), into NH3, protonated to NH4 +. Ammonium ion is rapidly assimilated by bacteria and plants,
typically by combination with TCA cycle intermediates
to form key amino acids, such as glutamate (discussed in
Chapter 15). The ability to assimilate NH4 + into nitrogenous organic molecules is found in virtually all primary producers.
Fixation of nitrogen requires enormous energy because

Half the ammonia is protonated at about pH 9.3, so at nearneutral pH, most exists in the protonated form, NH4+.
Nitrogen fixation is catalyzed by the enzyme nitrogenase (discussed in Chapter 15). The highly reductive reactions of nitrogenase require exclusion of oxygen, yet they
also require a tremendous input of energy, usually provided
by aerobic metabolism. Therefore, nitrogen-fixing bacteria
generally isolate anaerobic nitrogen fixation from aerobic
metabolism by one of several mechanisms, such as the heterocysts of cyanobacteria (also discussed in Chapter 15).
Given the energy expense and the need to exclude oxygen, many species of bacteria, as well as all eukaryotes, lack
the nitrogen fixation pathway. But all ecosystems, both
marine and terrestrial, include some species of bacteria and
archaea that fix N2 into ammonia. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil include obligate anaerobes, such as Clostridium species, and facultative Gram-negative enteric species
of Klebsiella and Salmonella, as well as obligate respirers
such as Pseudomonas. The rhizobia form nitrogen-fixing
endosymbionts of legume plants. In oceans and in freshwater systems, cyanobacteria are the major nitrogen fixers.
After fixation, all these organisms assimilate the reduced
nitrogen into essential components of their cells. Within
an ecosystem, nitrogen fixers ultimately make the reduced
nitrogen available for assimilation by nonfixing microbes
and plants, either directly through symbiotic association
(such as that of rhizobia and legumes, discussed in Chapter 21) or indirectly through predation (marine cyanobacteria) and decomposition (soil bacteria).
If nitrogen fixation is ubiquitous in soil and water, then
why is nitrogen limiting? Nitrogen fixation is extremely
energy intensive; thus, the rate of fixation usually fails to
meet the potential demand of other members of the ecosystem. The one exception is legume symbiosis with rhizobia,
which provide ample nitrogen for their hosts.
In agriculture, symbiotic nitrogen fixation by rhizobial bacteria increases the yield of crops such as soybeans
(Fig. 22.14A). To enhance colonization by nitrogen fixers,
farmers apply molecules called isoflavonoids, which mimic
the natural plant-derived attractants for rhizobia.

Rhizobial nitrogen fixation enhances growth of soybeans and other
major crops. B. Nitrate in drinking water is especially prevalent in agricultural regions of the United States. Ammonification of fertilizer,
followed by nitrification, generates nitrate and nitrite. Nitrate and
nitrite runoff from oxidized nitrogenous fertilizers pollutes streams
and groundwater.

Nitrification. Free ammonia in soil or water is quickly oxidized for energy by nitrifiers, bacterial species that possess
enzymes for oxidation of ammonia to nitrite (NO2 –), or
of nitrite to nitrate (NO3 –). This process is called nitrification. Nitrification of ammonia is a form of lithotrophy,
an energy generation pathway involving oxidation of minerals. The nitrification pathway generates the red base of
the triangle in Figure 22.13A. The pathway of nitrification includes:

CHAPTER 22

The pathway includes two separate energy generation
mechanisms: (1) ammonia through NH 2OH to nitrite,
and (2) nitrite to nitrate. Typically, soil contains both kinds
of microbes, collaborating to complete the conversion to
nitrate, while some species of Nitrospira perform the entire
pathway oxidizing ammonia to nitrate. Nitrifying genera
include Nitrosomonas, which oxidizes ammonia to nitrite,
as well as Nitrobacter (Fig. 22.13B) and Nitrospira, which
oxidize nitrite to nitrate. Nitrite can also serve as an electron donor for photosynthesis by Thiocapsa species. Note
that the production of both nitrite and nitrate generates
acid, which can acidify the soil.

Thought Question

22.5 In the laboratory, which bacterial genus would likely
grow on artificial medium including NH2OH as the energy
source: Nitrosomonas or Nitrobacter?

Nitrate produced in the soil is assimilated by plants and
bacteria nearly as quickly as ammonium ion, although extra
energy is needed to reduce nitrate to NH4+ for incorporation into biomass. Nitrate assimilation to biomass is called
assimilatory nitrate reduction. Assimilatory nitrate reduction differs from the nitrate reduction involved in anaerobic
respiration, which releases the reduced nitrogen and yields
energy. In agriculture, intensive fertilization generates a
large excess of ammonia resulting from ammonification,
the breakdown of organic nitrogen, releasing ammonia.
Ammonia is oxidized rapidly by lithotrophic bacteria (nitrifiers). The excess ammonia leads to a buildup of nitrites and
nitrates, which are highly soluble in water, and they readily diffuse into aquatic systems. Aquatic nitrate reacts with
organic compounds to form toxic nitrosamines. Nitrate
influx also relieves the nitrogen limit on algae, causing
algal blooms and raising BOD. Chronic nitrate influx leads
to eutrophication and die-off of fish.
Consumption of nitrate in drinking water can lead to
methemoglobinemia, a blood disorder in which hemoglobin is inactivated. Methemoglobinemia is a problem for
infants because their stomachs are not yet acidic enough
to inhibit growth of bacteria that convert nitrate to nitrite.
Nitrite oxidizes the iron in hemoglobin, eliminating its
capacity to carry oxygen. The failure to carry oxygen leads
to a bluish appearance—one cause of “blue baby syndrome.” Nitrite-induced blue baby syndrome is a problem
in intensively cultivated agricultural regions, such as Kansas
and Nebraska (Fig. 22.14B).
Agricultural runoff also contributes to oxygen minimum zones and dead zones, such as those off the Oregon
coast and in the Gulf of Mexico. The amines in sewage are

removed as ammonia (ammonification), and the ammonia
is oxidized by lithotrophs. The major marine ammonia oxidizers include the Thaumarchaeota, such as Nitrosopumilus
(discussed in Chapter 19).
Denitrification. N2 is regenerated by anaerobic respiration

(see Fig. 22.13A), in which an oxidized form of nitrogen,
such as nitrate or nitrite, receives electrons from organic
electron donors. Bacteria and archaea reduce nitrate
through a series of decreased oxidation states back to atmospheric nitrogen:

In terms of elemental flux through ecosystems, nitrate
and nitrite reduction are known as denitrification or dissimilatory nitrate reduction. (In contrast, assimilatory
nitrate reduction incorporates nitrogen into biomass.)
Anaerobic respirers in soil or water use an oxidized form of
nitrogen as an alternative electron acceptor in the absence
of O2 (discussed in Chapter 14). All types of nitrogenbased anaerobic respiration are repressed in the presence of
oxygen, a more favorable electron acceptor; therefore, denitrification is limited to anoxic habitats.
In undisturbed environments, the products of nitrate
respiration rarely build up to levels that harm the ecosystem. Heavy fertilization, however, causes buildup of excess
nitrate and so increases the environmental rate of denitrification. During this process, some of the nitrogen escapes
as nitrous oxide gas (N2O). A highly potent greenhouse
gas, N2O generates 200 times the warming effect of CO2;
thus, relatively small amounts of N2O can make a disproportionate contribution to global warming. Furthermore,
N2O in the upper atmosphere reacts catalytically with
ozone, depleting the ozone layer. Thus, the atmospheric
effects of bacterial denitrification are a serious concern in
agricultural and waste treatment processes.
Nitrous oxide also builds up in marine dead zones, where
the nitrates from ammonium oxidation are subsequently
used as electron acceptors. Syed Wajih Naqvi and colleagues
at the National Institute of Oceanography in Goa, India,
investigated denitrification in the zone of hypoxia off the
coast of India (Fig. 22.15A). The study revealed unexpectedly high levels of N2O production at a series of stations
within the zone. In one experiment, introduction of nitrate

nitrite and N2O (Fig. 22.15B), a

Nitrification (NH4+ ⎯→ NO2 – ⎯→ NO3 –) is aerobic
oxidation of ammonia to nitrite and nitrate. Nitrification yields energy for lithotrophic bacteria in soil and
water, and consumes oxygen, thus expanding marine
oxygen minimum zones.
Bacteria conduct anaerobic respiration, reducing
nitrate to N2 and nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse
gas. In the deep ocean, NO3 – may be reduced by hydrogen gas to NH3.
Under anaerobic conditions, bacteria oxidize NH4+
with NO2 –, generating nitrogen gas (the anammox
reaction).

22.5

Sulfur, Phosphorus,
and Metals

Besides carbon and nitrogen, many other elements participate in biochemical cycles that have important consequences
for the biosphere, as well as for human environments. Sulfur undergoes a “triangle” of redox conversions analogous
to that of nitrogen. Phosphorus, unlike other biological
elements, is generally assimilated in the oxidized state, and
phosphate is often a limiting nutrient for plants. Iron cycles
in complex interactions with sulfur and phosphate. Beyond

Sulfur is a major component of biomass, including proteins and cofactors. Like carbon and nitrogen, sulfur can be
assimilated in either mineral or organic form. At the same
time, assimilation competes with dissimilation. Reduced
and oxidized forms of sulfur (comparable to those of nitrogen; see Table 22.3) offer electron donors and acceptors
for dissimilatory reactions that generate energy. Reduced
forms of sulfur, such as H 2S, can also participate in photolysis through reactions analogous to those of H 2O. Oxidized forms, such as sulfate, serve as anaerobic electron
acceptors. As with nitrogen, most of these redox reactions
are performed solely by bacteria and archaea. The biochemistry of sulfur cycling has important environmental consequences, such as the corrosion of concrete and iron.
In the ocean, sulfate is the second most common anion
after chloride. Marine sulfate turns over slowly and constitutes an essentially limitless supply. Thus, sulfur is
rarely a limiting nutrient. Marine algae release various
reduced forms of sulfur, such as dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). Bacteria metabolize DMSP to dimethyl sulfide [(CH3)2S], which causes part of the “salty sea smell.”
Dimethyl sulfide enters the atmosphere, where it becomes
oxidized to aerosols that may help water condense and form
clouds. In the atmosphere, the overall amount of sulfur
(mainly sulfur dioxide) is small. Nevertheless, some sulfur compounds generate toxic effects, as well as acidic pollution. Thus, both biochemical and industrial sources of
atmospheric sulfur are of concern.
Competing assimilatory and dissimilatory sulfur reactions in the biosphere form a “sulfur triangle” including H 2S, S0, and SO42– (Fig. 22.17A). The oxidation and
reduction pathways are analogous to those of nitrogen (compare Fig. 22.13A). Bacterial sulfur metabolism includes
additional options of anaerobic phototrophy, such as H2S
phototrophy. In an aquatic system, H2S arises from spring
waters welling up from the sediment and from decomposition of detritus. In decomposition, anaerobic respirers
such as Desulfovibrio species convert sulfate to sulfur, then
to H 2S. As H 2S rises to the oxygenated surface water, it is
readily oxidized by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria such as Acidithiobacillus and Beggiatoa. Beggiatoa species are known as
“white sulfur bacteria” because they form white mats (Fig.
22.17B). Their appearance is due to the sulfur granules
generated by sulfide oxidation. Microbial sulfide oxidation
is helpful for environments because it removes H2S, which is
highly toxic to most nonsulfur bacteria and plants. Because
of the toxicity of H 2S, autotrophs more readily assimilate

reduce SO42– to the thiol form found in proteins.
If light is available, anaerobic phototrophs such as Rhodopseudomonas species will use light energy to oxidize H 2S.
Some phototrophic bacteria further oxidize the S0 generated to sulfate. In some sulfur-rich lakes, such as the Russian Lake Sernoye, underground springs pump in so much
H 2S that most of the sulfur is photolytically converted to
S0, which forms up to 5% of the sediment. This elemental
sulfur can be mined commercially.
In thermal vent ecosystems, several sulfur-based reactions drive metabolism. For example, thermal vent archaea
such as Pyrodictium species use sulfur to oxidize hydrogen
gas to H 2S:
H 2 + S0 ⎯→ H 2S
This type of sulfur-based hydrogenotrophy is enhanced by
the vent conditions of extreme pressure and temperature
(100°C)—conditions under which elemental sulfur exists
in a molten state more accessible to microbes than solid
sulfur.
Decomposition of biomass generates various organic
sulfur compounds, many of which are volatile. Odors of
certain microbial sulfur products contribute to the smell of
rotting eggs, but others enhance the taste of cheeses (discussed in Chapter 16).

FIGURE 22.17 ■ The sulfur cycle. A. The “sulfur triangle.”
With oxygen, bacteria and archaea oxidize H2S to sulfur dioxide, and then to sulfate. Anaerobically, H2S may be photolyzed
to sulfur. Sulfate serves as an electron acceptor for anaerobic
respiration, or it may be assimilated into biomass, with reduced
sulfur groups (RSH). Algae form DMSP, which bacteria convert to
dimethyl sulfide. B. Microbial mat of white, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria (probably Beggiatoa) growing at a sulfide spring.

Sulfur is reduced by sulfur-reducing bacteria in many
subsurface environments, such as beneath deposits of oil
and coal (Fig. 22.18A). Oil and coal contain sulfur in
the form of SO42– and provide a carbon source for sulfate
respirers (sulfate-reducing bacteria that respire using sulfate as a terminal electron acceptor). The products of sulfate
respiration include S0 and organic sulfur. When the fuel is
burned, these forms of sulfur cause severe pollution. Before
burning, however, the S0 and organic sulfur can be oxidized by sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Fuel processors are now
turning to sulfur-oxidizing microbes for experimental use
in “desulfuration,” the removal of sulfur from coal.
One habitat that exhibits the entire range of sulfur
oxidation states is a sewer pipe. In a concrete sewer pipe,
the alternation between anaerobic and oxygenated sulfur biochemistry causes severe corrosion (Fig. 22.18B).
The microbial decomposition of sewage yields large quantities of toxic H 2S, which then volatilizes to high levels
that endanger sewer workers. The H 2S is then oxidized
to sulfuric acid by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, a bacterium that colonizes the surface of the concrete. The sulfuric acid (H 2SO 4) decreases the pH at the concrete surface
to pH 2. In the concrete surface, sulfuric acid converts
calcium hydroxide to soluble calcium sulfate. Over several
years, this corrosion can eat away half the thickness of a
sewer pipe.

first SO2 and ultimately sulfuric acid (acid rain). B. In a sewer pipe, sulfate-reducing bacteria (sulfate respirers) generate H2S. Sulfur-oxidizing
bacteria then oxidize H2S to sulfate in the form of sulfuric acid. The sulfuric acid reacts with calcium hydroxide in the concrete, thus corroding
the interior surface of the pipe.

Sulfur metabolism shows important connections with
metabolism of metals. For example, sulfur-oxidizing bacteria such as A. ferrooxidans oxidize iron as well (discussed
shortly).

Thought Question

22.6 Compare and contrast the cycling of nitrogen and
sulfur. How are the cycles similar? How are they different?

The Phosphate Cycle

Phosphorus is a fundamental element of nucleic acids,
phospholipids, and phosphorylated proteins. Unlike sulfur
and nitrogen, which are found in several different oxidation states, phosphorus is cycled mainly in the fully oxidized state of phosphate (Fig. 22.19). The absence of fully
reduced phosphorus in ecosystems may be due to the fact
that reduced phosphorus (phosphine, PH3) undergoes
spontaneous combustion in the presence of oxygen. Nevertheless, some anaerobic decomposers use phosphate as
a terminal electron acceptor, reducing it to phosphine. In
marshes and graveyards, where extensive decomposition
occurs, phosphine emanates from the ground, where it
ignites with a green glow. Microbial respiration of phosphate might be the cause of such “ghostly” apparitions.

Where is phosphate available? Although phosphate is
abundant in Earth’s crust, its availability in ecosystems is
limited by its tendency to precipitate with calcium, magnesium, and iron ions. Thus, dissolved phosphate in water and
soil is often a limiting nutrient for productivity. In natural
ecosystems, the available phosphate is taken up rapidly by
bacteria and phytoplankton, and then consumed by grazers
and predators and dispersed by decomposers.
Marine water is extremely limited for phosphate,
because of the distance from sediment minerals. Thus, the
genomes of marine phototrophs encode many systems for
acquiring phosphate from organic sources. Some actually
acquire phosphorus in a partly reduced form, such as phosphite (PO33–) or phosphonate (HPO32–), both of which are
available in marine water. In addition, marine phototrophs
show an unusual ability to substitute nonphosphorus lipids for phospholipids, thus cutting their phosphorus needs
by half. For example, the cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus,
Synechococcus, and Trichodesmium can replace membrane
phospholipids with sulfonated lipids. Similarly, algae such
as Thalassiosira species can replace phosphatidylcholine
with betaine, which contains no phosphate but includes a
carboxylate group.
Another microbial response to phosphate scarcity is to
replace membrane phosphates with organic phosphonates,
in which the phosphorus atom bonds directly to carbon
(R–PO32–), instead of the easily hydrolyzed phosphoester

many bacteria can cleave to obtain phosphate. Phosphate
scavenging from methylphosphonate releases methane,
thus interacting with the carbon cycle.
In agriculture, phosphate is often added as a fertilizer.
Phosphate fertilizer is obtained by treating calcium phosphate rock with sulfuric acid, producing calcium sulfate
(gypsum) and phosphoric acid. Excess phosphate from fertilizer or industry may drain into streams and lakes where
phosphorus is the limiting element. The sudden influx of
phosphate causes an algal bloom. The overgrowth of algae
leads to overgrowth of heterotrophs, depletion of oxygen,
and destruction of the food chain.

Thought Question

22.7 Compare and contrast the cycling of nitrogen and
phosphorus. How are the cycles similar? How are they
different?

The Iron Cycle

Why do organisms need iron? As a micronutrient, iron
forms a negligible part of biomass but is essential for
growth (discussed in Chapter 4). Organisms require iron
as a cofactor for enzymes and an essential component of

2FeS2 + 7O2 + 2H 2O + 4H+ ⎯→ 2Fe2++ 4H 2SO4
Lithotrophs such as Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans can
catalyze iron oxidation to yield energy, thus increasing
the rate of production of sulfuric acid. Rapid sulfuric
acid production leads to acid mine drainage. Where acid
mine drainage enters an aquatic system, the reduced iron
is oxidized by lithotrophs to ferric hydroxide, forming an
orange precipitate, seen in home plumbing (Fig. 22.20B).
Iron mine drainage causes severe pollution of streams
(Fig. 22.21).
In anoxic habitats, such as benthic sediment, Fe3+ is
largely reduced to Fe2+ by anaerobic respiration. Reduction
leads to loss of the reddish color, generating gray-colored
sediment, as in wetland soil (discussed in Chapter 21). The
reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is one of the enriching contributions of anaerobic sediment to freshwater wetlands and
coastal estuaries, because reduced iron is more available to
plants and bacteria. Oxidized iron, in aerobic soils, can be
taken up only by bacteria. Bacteria synthesize special iron
uptake systems, including molecules called siderophores
that bind ferric ion outside and then are taken up by the
cell (see Section 4.2). Bacterial iron then becomes available
to consumers in the ecosystem.
Iron cycling often connects with the sulfur cycle in
ways that can prove unfortunate for human engineering.

The most serious problem is anaerobic corrosion of iron.
Iron corrodes spontaneously in the presence of oxygen. In
anoxic environments, however, little spontaneous corrosion
takes place. Instead, iron is corroded by sulfate-reducing
bacteria (Fig. 22.22). Bacteria such as Desulfovibrio and
Desulfobacter can grow on the iron surface, forming an
anaerobic biofilm. Within the biofilm, iron is oxidized to
Fe2+, and sulfate dissolved in the water is reduced to ferrous sulfide:

carbon for biomass, they consume bacteria as a source of
iron. Another source of marine iron, discovered in 2013, is
hydrothermal vents.
Iron is thus a limiting nutrient for marine phytoplankton. As discussed in Chapter 21, when higher quantities

containing iron is so distant that its iron is largely inaccessible. The main source of marine iron is eolian (windborne) dust from dry land, such as from windstorms in
the Sahara desert. Most of the wind-borne iron is particulate, oxidized, and unavailable to eukaryotic phytoplankton (algae). Thus, bacteria that acquire and reduce ferric
iron provide the main entry of iron into the ecosystem.
This may explain why so many marine algae are mixotrophs: Although their photosynthesis can fi x plenty of

of a limiting nutrient enter an ecosystem, the limited populations rapidly increase. The rise of algal populations
following iron addition was demonstrated in an “iron fertilization” experiment conducted in 2007 by Phillip Boyd
and colleagues at the University of Otago, New Zealand.
Several thousand kilograms of ferrous sulfate (FeSO 4) was
released in the Southern Ocean, near Antarctica. Within
a week after the iron release, there was a bloom of phytoplankton. The dominant phytoplankton in the bloom
were diatoms of the species Fragilariopsis kerguelensis.
The diatom bloom was so large that it was detected by a
NASA satellite as a region of increased color reflected by
chlorophyll.
The dramatic effects of iron fertilization led some
researchers to propose that increasing iron throughout
the oceans could cause blooms of diatoms, removing CO2
from the atmosphere. If a sufficiently large proportion of
the diatoms were to escape predation and fall to the ocean
floor, they would effectively remove their carbon from circulation. An alternative outcome, however, would likely be
eutrophication, causing an ecological collapse comparable
to a dead zone.
While iron fertilization is unlikely to meet our need
for CO2 removal, microbiology offers other approaches to
offset the perturbation of Earth’s carbon cycle by human
technology. For example, bacteria and algae may be engineered to provide biofuels, such as hydrogen gas, whose use
yields energy without releasing CO2.
Our view of Earth’s biosphere increasingly is moving
toward environmental management—the concept that wilderness as such no longer exists, but only a biosphere to be
managed for better or worse. Microbes will have many roles
as partners in environmental management.

Besides iron, numerous trace metals interact with bacterial
species as either electron donors or acceptors (Table 22.4).
Bacterial conversion of metals can either produce toxic species or remove toxic metals from ecosystems. For example, chromium-6 [Cr(VI)] is an extremely toxic pollutant
that can be reduced by soil bacteria to the much less toxic
Cr(III). Microbial metal cycling is discussed further in
eTopic 22.3.
How can bioremediation remove toxic minerals from
groundwater? An example is the bioremediation of arsenic,
a critical water contaminant in densely populated countries
such as India, Bangladesh, and Cambodia. Arsenic causes
cancers and crippling skin disorders. Arsenic and other metals can be removed from groundwater via bioremediation.
Bhaskar Sengupta and colleagues at Queen’s University,
Belfast, developed a bioreactor technology for subterranean
arsenic removal, or SAR (Fig. 22.23). This process takes
advantage of the fact that different oxidation states of arsenic differ in their solubility. For the bioreactor, groundwater is cycled through an oxygen pump and returned to the
source. Naturally occurring lithotrophic bacteria oxidize
arsenite (AsO33–, water-soluble) to arsenate (AsO43–, insoluble). Bacteria also oxidize iron and manganese to their less
soluble forms, as discussed in Chapter 14. The negatively
and positively charged ions precipitate together, effectively
removed from the water.

Multiple Limiting Factors Modulate
Complex Ecosystems

A common assumption of terrestrial and aquatic ecology is
that a single nutrient, such as phosphorus or iron, is limiting for a given ecosystem. The requirement for more than
one limiting factor is known as resource colimitation.
In highly oligotrophic marine water, populations often
depend on multiple limiting factors. For example, in the
Baltic Sea, both nitrogen and phosphorus are present in
such low concentrations that they must be added together
in order to stimulate a phytoplankton bloom. In another
example, the North Atlantic is limited for both phosphorus
and iron. Addition of both P and Fe stimulates growth of
nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.

To Summarize

Other Metals in the Environment

Another concern for environmental management is that of
toxic metals and metalloids such as mercury and arsenic.

Sulfate is abundant in marine water.
Oxidized and reduced forms of sulfur are cycled in
ecosystems. Sulfate and sulfite serve as electron acceptors for respiration. Hydrogen sulfide serves as an electron donor. Sulfur oxidation to sulfuric acid causes acid
mine drainage and pipe erosion.

Phosphorus cycles primarily in the fully oxidized
form (phosphate). Phosphate limits growth of phototrophic bacteria and algae in some aquatic and marine
systems.
Iron cycles in oxidized and reduced forms. Oxidized iron (Fe3+) serves as a terminal electron acceptor
in anaerobic soil and water. Reduced iron (Fe2+) from
rock is oxidized through weathering or mining. Bacterial lithotrophy accelerates iron oxidation, leading to
acidification.
Metal toxins can be metabolized by bacteria. Bacterial metabolism may either increase or decrease toxicity. Metabolic conversion to an insoluble form, such
as arsenite to arsenate, offers an effective means of
bioremediation.
Marine habitats show resource colimitation. Multiple
resources may be limiting for the phytoplankton community or for different populations.

with strong covalent bonds. The same fundamental molecules that appear in early-Earth simulation experiments,
such as adenine and glycine, also appear in meteorites.
Thus, we suspect that the fundamental building blocks for
biochemistry are universal. On the other hand, if life could
indeed be founded on some other basis, how would we
recognize it?
If life is found on other planets, it will almost certainly
include microbes. In fact, a case can be made that the
majority of biospheres in our galaxy would consist entirely
of microbial life, since microbes inhabit a wider range
of conditions than do multicellular plants and animals.
Even on Earth itself, the largest bulk of our biosphere—
including deep sediments and rock strata—consists of
microbial ecosystems.

Did Mars Once Support a Biosphere?

For several reasons, the most studied candidate for extraterrestrial life has been the planet Mars:
■

Geology. Of all the solar planets, Mars seems the most
similar to Earth in its topography; indeed, some areas
of Mars remarkably resemble desertscapes on Earth.
Martian rock contains the fundamental elements needed
for life on Earth.

■

Day and year length. Mars has a day length similar to
that of Earth, and a year only twice as long as ours.

■

Temperature. The average temperature on Mars is
220 K (–53°C), too cold for most biochemistry on
Earth, but its temperature rises above freezing at the
equator. By contrast, the torrid heat of Venus (460°C)
would exclude stable macromolecules.

■

Atmosphere. Overall, Mars has an atmospheric pressure
of 6 millibars (mbar), barely a hundredth that of Earth
(1,013 mbar), and it lacks molecular oxygen. Thus, aerobes could not grow. But the Martian atmosphere does
include carbon dioxide, actually at 20 times the CO2
content on Earth, so there would be plenty for photoautotrophic production of biomass.

■

Water. Surface water freezes out of the Martian atmosphere, without existing as a liquid. But mineral formations suggest that liquid water flowed in the past.
Liquid water may yet exist deep underground, supporting life-forms similar to the endoliths of Earth’s crustal
rock.

Astrobiology

As we come to appreciate the ubiquitous contributions of
microbes to shaping our planet, in all its diverse habitats,
increasingly we wonder whether microbes exist on worlds
beyond Earth. Is Earth unique in supporting life, or have
living cells evolved as well on Mars or Venus or on Jupiter’s
planet-sized moons? Astrobiology is the study of life in the
universe, including its origin and possible existence beyond
Earth. The discovery of life beyond Earth would arguably
be the most significant advance in science since a human
set foot on the moon.
If the same physical and chemical laws govern the universe everywhere, then it is hard to suppose that only
one of the billions of stars would have a planet supporting life. On the other hand, we have no idea how many
planets have been capable of developing and sustaining a
biosphere. As Isaac Asimov said, “There are two possibilities. Maybe we’re alone. Maybe we’re not. Both are equally
frightening.”
If life exists elsewhere, is it built on the same fundamental elements as ours? Many lines of evidence suggest that
the biochemistry of life elsewhere would resemble that
of Earth. Terrestrial life is founded on macroelements in
the first two rows of the periodic table, including carbon,
nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, and sulfur (see Table 22.1;
for the periodic table, see Appendix 1). The valence numbers (that is, the number of electrons in the outer electron
shell) of these elements from the middle of the periodic
table enable them to form complex molecular structures

The existence of liquid water is a key question because
on Earth, wherever liquid water exists—even brine (concentrated salt) at –20°C—there we find microbial life. In 2015,
NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) found evidence
of flowing water on Mars (see Chapter 1). Water condenses

and freezes out of the Martian atmosphere, generating ice
clouds and snow. The Martian soil composition showed high
levels of perchlorate, a chemical that attracts water to form
liquid solution and can support the metabolism of some
Earth microbes.
Other evidence for liquid water in the past on Mars
comes from geological formations surveyed by the Mars
Reconnaissance Orbiter in 2007. The orbiter mapped sedimentary deposits in Mars’s Jezero crater (Fig. 22.24).
The crater formations reveal flow patterns typical of a river
delta flowing into a lake. Claylike mineral deposits (falsecolored green in Fig. 22.24) may have trapped organic
compounds needed for life. The layered patterns are best
explained by a model involving fluid flow, such as the flow
of water.
If life once existed on Mars, what became of it? Two
main possibilities are considered:
■

Life developed and existed until the planet froze.
Under this scenario, life originated much as it did on
Earth, during a time of heavy bombardment from
space and outgassing of nitrogen and carbon dioxide.
Unfortunately, however, life failed to generate sufficient
atmosphere for a greenhouse effect to sustain temperate
conditions. No oxygenic organisms produced molecular
oxygen and an ozone layer.

■

MICROBES IN GLOBAL ELEMENTAL CYCLES

■

Life developed and still exists underground. In the
absence of an ozone layer, the Martian surface is sterilized by cosmic radiation. Nevertheless, microbes may
yet exist deep underground, similar to the endolithic
prokaryotes on Earth, or the subsurface brine communities of Antarctica (see Special Topic 22.1). Subsurface
microbes are protected from cosmic radiation.

Do Biosignatures Indicate Life?

If microbes do exist on Mars, they should be detectable.
But the detection of unknown life, even on Earth, remains
a challenge. The advent of PCR sequence detection of
species based on ribosomal genes has revealed thousands
of unknown species, most of which cannot be grown or
recognized by other methods. Other species may well be
missed if their rRNA sequences fail to amplify with our
probes. On Mars, assuming life evolved independently of
Earth life-forms, we would have no way to define sequence
probes for detection.
Instead, researchers try to define biosignatures, chemical
and physical signs that could only have been formed by life.
Most of the proposed biosignatures are based on types of
evidence for life on Earth, either as fossils of ancient life (discussed in Chapter 17) or as signs of current life in extreme
habitats. Proposed biosignatures include the following:
■

Microfossils. The mineralization of microbial cells leads
to the formation of structures that can be visualized
under a microscope. The cell fossils must be sufficiently
distinct to establish that no abiotic process could have
formed them.

■

Isotope ratios. Certain biochemical reactions preferentially use one isotope of an atom over another; for example, Rubisco, the key enzyme of carbon dioxide fixation,
uses 12C in preference to 13C. Thus, both photosynthetic
and chemolithoautotrophic use of 12C can decrease the
12
C/13C ratio in subsequent carbonate deposits. Isotope
ratios of nitrogen, oxygen, and sulfur are also used as
biosignatures.

■

Mineral deposits. Certain mineral formations are
observed to be caused only by microbial activity. For
example, insoluble manganese oxides such as Mn 2O3
are almost always the result of microbial oxidation of
reduced manganese. Reduced manganese ions are very
stable, and their abiotic oxidation rate is extremely slow.

■

Metabolic activity. Samples of soil can be incubated
with radioactive tracer substances such as 14CO2 and
tested for metabolic conversion or incorporation into
biomass. It must be established that the conversion
could not have occurred abiotically and that no organisms from Earth were present.

896

PART 4

■

MICROBIAL DIVERSITY AND ECOLOGY

Various kinds of evidence for life on Mars have been
reported, such as possible microfossils within a Martian
meteorite that landed in Antarctica. Metabolic activity was
tested in samples obtained by the NASA Viking lander in
1975. As of this writing, however, no evidence has proved
conclusive for active or past living microorganisms on Mars.

If no life exists—or if it exists only in the form of microbes
deep underground—should we consider human intervention, or terraforming, to make Mars habitable for life from
Earth? Scenarios for terraforming, long explored in science
fiction, are now receiving serious thought among space
scientists. Terraforming Mars would require increasing
the temperature and air pressure. The temperature of the
atmosphere might be increased by release of greenhouse
gases. In addition, sufficient carbon dioxide and nitrogen
gases must be made available from the Mars surface rock.
In principle, microbes from Earth could be seeded to grow
and generate an atmosphere containing nitrogen, oxygen,
and CO2.
The dilemmas and consequences of terraforming are
depicted in the novel Red Mars (1993), by Kim Stanley
Robinson. In favor of terraforming, it is argued that Mars
offers enormous natural resources of potential benefit for
humanity, especially as terrestrial resources are used up.
Human settlements on Mars would be a major step forward for space exploration. On the other hand, it is argued
that the planet Mars is a natural monument, a place with its
own right to exist as such. It should be allowed to remain
in its natural state for future generations to appreciate. As
a practical matter, terraforming remains unfeasible for the
near future. For example, the amount of chlorofluorocarbons required to raise Martian temperature is calculated to
be 100 times greater than our global capacity to produce
such substances.

Does Europa Have an Ocean?

Farther out in the solar system, surprising candidates for
microbial life are the moons of Jupiter. In 2000, the Galileo space probe passed several of Jupiter’s moons, including
Ganymede, Callisto, and Europa (Fig. 22.25). While their
distance from the Sun results in extreme cold, these bodies receive extra heat from friction generated by tidal forces
from the giant planet Jupiter. In the case of Europa, the
tidal forces have been calculated to provide enough heat to
liquefy water without boiling it off. Furthermore, measurement of Europa’s magnetic field suggests that its composition includes a dense iron core surrounded by 15% water.

Could Mars Be Terraformed
to Support Earth Life?

FIGURE 22.25

■

Jupiter’s moon Europa. Does life exist be-

neath Europa’s ice, in a salty sea?

Most of the water must be locked in ice, but tidal heating
could melt enough water for an underlying ocean of brine.
On Earth, similar brine lakes beneath the ice of Antarctica
harbor halophilic archaea that grow at –20°C.
If such oceans do exist, how could they support life without photosynthesis? Photosynthesis is impossible at Jupiter’s
distance from the Sun. However, an alternative source of
chemical energy might be the influx of charged particles
accelerated in Jupiter’s magnetic field. Charged particles
entering Europa’s ice can react with water to form hydrogen
peroxide (H 2O2). The H 2O2 then breaks down, releasing
molecular oxygen. Oxygen reaching the brine layer below
could combine with electron donors from crustal vents and
power metabolism. Alternatively, molecular hydrogen (H 2)
could be generated from water ionized by decay of radioisotopes. A similar source of H 2 for life has been proposed to
occur on Earth in rock strata several kilometers below the
surface, where it may support lithotrophs. On Europa, the
hydrogen could then combine with oxygen gas or other oxidants to power life. These schemes are highly speculative—
but tantalizing enough to encourage future NASA missions
to take a closer look at Europa and its sister moons.

Does Life Exist on Planets
of Distant Stars?

The past decade of astronomy has seen an extraordinary
growth in our knowledge of solar systems beyond our own.
Now that we know that so many other stars possess planets,

we can only wonder whether they also possess
biospheres of life-forms we would recognize.
In recent years, astronomers have found several hundred “extrasolar” planets orbiting distant stars, including some the size of Earth.
Could we ever hope to detect signs of life on
an extrasolar planet? A possible means of detection is suggested by William Sparks and colleagues at the Space Telescope Science Institute
in Baltimore, and collaborating institutions.
They show that light scattered by marine phytoplankton exhibits a property called “circular
polarization.” Circular polarization arises from
substances that are homochiral—that is, present in only one of two mirror forms, such as the
L and D forms of an amino acid. Homochirality is a strong biosignature, typical of proteins
and metabolites. If someday we have telescopes
capable of detecting light from distant planets,
circular polarization might provide evidence
of life.
Figure 22.26 shows an infrared photograph
through the Spitzer Space Telescope of nebula
RCW-49, a gaseous cloud full of newborn stars.
Recall from Chapter 17 that as stars form, they
take up dust of supernovas that includes all the
elements needed to form biomolecules. Spectroscopic observation of RCW-49 reveals stars
surrounded by disks coalescing into planets.
The planetary disks contain icy particles full of
organic molecules such as methanol, glycine, and
ethylene glycol, a reduced form of sugar. Could
there be biospheres in the making?

Concluding Thoughts
To Summarize
■

■

■

Astrobiology is the study of life in the universe,
including possible habitats outside Earth.
The search for extraterrestrial life is based on methods similar to those used to seek early life on Earth.
Evidence includes chemical and physical biosignatures,
isotope ratios, microfossils, and metabolic activity.
Mars is the planet whose geology most closely resembles that of Earth. Geological features strongly support
the past existence of flowing water, a prerequisite for
microbial life.

Our observations of distant molecules, as well as our analysis of meteorites (discussed in Chapter 17), suggest that the
biomolecules of Earth fit into a universal pattern of interstellar chemistry. Whether life exists elsewhere or we are
alone, we must remember that our Earth is the only place
we know of at this time that can support humans and the
forms of life we require for our own survival. The survival
of our entire biosphere depends on our microbial partners cycling key elements and acquiring energy to drive
the food web. For the first time in history, human technology now rivals the ability of microbes to alter fundamental cycles of biogeochemistry. But to manage and
moderate our alterations—for our own survival and that of
the biosphere—our fate still depends on the microbes.

which are nonspecific defenses, will repel most microorganisms. But for microbes able to breach these

immune defenses. Chapter 23 explores the microbiome and describes the series of barriers and elaborate
innate immune defenses that keep microbes at bay.

23.1 Human Microbiome

How has your work changed the
way we think about inflammasome
assembly?

The field presumed that inflammasome assembly resembles that of the
multisubunit apoptosome, a molecular machine that initiates programmed
cell death in damaged cells. Every subunit of an apoptosome must bind to a
ligand before assembly. Here we, as well as Jijie Chai’s group,
showed that only one subunit of the inflammasome (NAIP2)
needs to bind ligand. The conformationally activated sensor
NAIP then triggers stepwise assembly of NLRC4 subunits
through ATPase-mediated polymerization. NLRC4 does not
need to bind microbial ligands.
Would interfering with the inflammasome have an effect
on infection or cancer?

31.1 nm

An acute infection would likely worsen if we inhibited inflammasome assembly, because reduced inflammation means the
microbe could grow more. Fortunately, other inflammasomeindependent mechanisms can still initiate inflammation. In the
context of long-term, chronic inflammation, inhibiting inflammasome assembly may have hugely beneficial effects, such
as in inflammatory diseases and autoimmunity. In contrast,
activating inflammasomes could, in some cases, enhance
antitumor immunity, as suggested by the protective role of
caspase-1 protease in a model of colorectal cancer.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Two vacationing tourists, unknown to each other, were swimming in the Gulf of Mexico along the Alabama coast. One, a
12-year-old girl, had a cut on her leg caused by the sharp edge
of a scooter. The other, a man 66 years of age, had recently cut
his arm on a nail protruding from a wooden handrail. Within
moments of entering the water, several small Gram-negative
microbes invaded both of their bodies through those cuts.
Four days later, the young girl was heading back to Birmingham, sitting in the back of the family car, oblivious to the battle recently waged in her bloodstream. At the same time, the
man lay dead of an aggressive blood infection.
Both swimmers were attacked by the same pathogen,
Vibrio vulnificus. Why did one live and the other die? As is
the case for most healthy people, a variety of nonspecific,
innate immune factors present in the girl’s body killed the
invading pathogen before it could multiply. The man, on
the other hand, was an alcoholic with liver disease. He was
deficient in several of those defense mechanisms—mechanisms that made the difference between life and death.
What are these powerful innate factors? How can they be
nonspecific, able to attack many different microbes without ever previously encountering any of them? And why do
they kill the invaders and not our own cells? The inflammasome described in the Current Research Highlight is
one of those important innate factors.
Before exploring questions of immunity and self-defense,
we must understand that each of us is a self-contained ecosystem, home to numerous microbes inhabiting all sorts of
body niches. The day-to-day presence of these microbial
guests both shapes and sharpens our immune system, but it
is a benefit that comes with considerable risk.

23.1

Human Microbiome

From the moment of our birth to the time of our death, we
are constantly populated by microbes. These include bacteria, archaea, fungi, viruses, and even some protozoa. The
consortium of colonizing microbes has been dubbed the
human microbiota or microbiome.

Note:

Usage of the terms “microbiota” and “microbiome” has
blurred. “Microbiota” originally referred to actual microbes inhabiting a body site, whereas “microbiome” referred to the gene pool
within those microbes.

To illustrate the significance of the microbiome, consider
that our bodies carry about 10 times as many bacterial cells as
nucleated human cells and about 100 times more nonredundant bacterial genes than human genes. (A recent estimate
that includes non-nucleated red blood cells places the bacterial/human cell ratio closer to between 1:1 and 2:1.) Microbes
colonize wherever our body meets the external environment

(for example, skin, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and parts
of the genitourinary tract). Most internal organs, blood, and
cerebrospinal fluid are sterile. The presence of any microbes
at these sites is considered an infection. The majority of species that make up our microbiota are unknown and have
never been grown in the laboratory. Consequently, metagenomic strategies (described in Chapters 7 and 21) are being
employed to identify our resident microbes. In 2016, the U.S.
government announced the National Microbiome Initiative
to advance understanding of how microbiomes contribute to
our health and the environment.
By and large, the body’s barriers of defense work well
to prevent incursions by microbiota or, in the event of an
incursion, to kill the invader. Unfortunately, these defenses
break down when an immune system is compromised by
medical treatments (such as anticancer drugs) or by diseases
(for instance, a deficiency in complement factors, discussed
in Section 23.6). Such a person is described as a compromised host and can be repeatedly infected by certain normal biota. Organisms causing disease in this situation are
called opportunistic pathogens.
We now understand that bacteria colonizing our bodies may be as important collectively as a kidney or liver. For
instance, Gary Siuzdak and his colleagues at the Scripps
Research Institute showed that our body cells are continually bathed in metabolites produced by gut microbes. It
is now thought that these metabolites, which circulate in
our blood, can have positive as well as negative effects on
human health and development.

Microbiome Acquisition and
the Hygiene Hypothesis

When and how does a person develop a microbiome?

Recent evidence suggests that the microbiome begins to
develop before birth. The fi rst stool (meconium) passed
by a newborn, before its fi rst meal, contains some bacteria.
The source of those microbes may be the placenta, which
has its own microbiome.
Once the baby breaks out of the embryonic membrane,
however, it is exposed to a dizzying array of microbes residing in the birth canal and the outside world. Contributions
to the baby’s skin, oral, gut, and genitourinary microbiomes come from the food they eat, the air they breathe,
and the people, places, and things they touch. Young babies
actually have microbiomes that are more diverse than those
of adults. But by 3 years old, the diversity decreases in complexity to assume adult composition.
Figure 23.1 presents the major human body sites (skin,
respiratory, digestive, and genitourinary tracts) that are

of bacteria, fungi, and viruses that comprise each microbiome. As you view the figure, notice the dramatic difference

in levels of Bacteroidetes when comparing nasal and intestinal microbiomes, or of Candida in the microbiomes of
the mouth and vagina. Composition within an individual’s
microbiome remains relatively constant over time but can
significantly fluctuate with diet, age, geography, or drugs.
The hygiene hypothesis. For millennia, human microbiota

were shaped by an intimate contact with natural environments composed of animals, caves, dirt, poop, and bugs.
This natural outdoor world harbored a vast array of microbial taxa that could compete to populate our skin and
mucosal surfaces. Today we are an indoor species spending
almost all of our time inside closed buildings, segregated
from nature—an arguably less diverse microbial environment. Add to that our use of soaps, antibiotics, and disinfectants and you can appreciate how severely we have
restricted our access to microbes. As a result, our microbiota appear less diverse than those of our long-ago ancestors.
Studies that have compared the modern-day human
microbiome with those of closely related wild African apes
and of uncontacted Amerindians (see Chapter 27) bear this
out. Although improved hygiene limits exposure to pathogens, recent studies suggest that narrowing the diversity of
our microbiome can contribute to inflammatory diseases
such as asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal
cancer, and obesity. Several intriguing studies find that,
even today, children who grow up on dairy farms are less
likely to develop allergies and asthma. The reason is that
our microbiome helps train our immune system (discussed
later and in Chapter 24). Exposure to more microbes and
other environmental antigens, especially early in life, may
produce a more tolerant, well-controlled immune system
less prone to inflammatory and autoimmune diseases (disorders in which the immune system reacts against the self).
The following sections describe the microbiota of various
body sites and discuss the benefits and risks of a microbiome.

Skin

The human adult, on average, is covered with 2 square
meters (over 21 square feet) of skin (epidermis) populated
by 1012 microorganisms. Skin microbiota include aerobes,
anaerobes, and facultative bacteria. There are, for instance,
approximately 104 –105 microbes per sweat gland at a ratio of
1 aerobe to 10 facultative or anaerobic species. As with all colonized body sites, resident (normal) and transient members of
the microbiota inhabit the skin. But even a resident microbe
exhibits diversity as different strains colonize at different
times. Thus, a human’s microbiome is not a static population,
but represents a vibrantly changing mix of strains and species.
Several features of epidermis make it difficult to colonize. Large expanses of skin are subject to drying,
although some areas harbor enough moisture to support
microbial growth; moist areas include scalp, ear, armpit,

and genital and anal regions. The skin has an acidic pH
(pH 4–6) owing to the secretion of organic acids by oil
and sweat glands. As noted in Section 5.4, organic acids
inhibit microbial growth by lowering bacterial cytoplasmic
pH. Epidermal secretions are high in salt and low in water
activity (see Section 5.3), and they contain enzymes, such
as lysozyme, that degrade bacterial peptidoglycan.
Despite these hurdles, many species of bacteria manage
to colonize the epidermal habitat. Most of these organisms are Gram-positive, because Gram-positive bacteria
tend to be more resistant to salt and dryness. Staphylococcus epidermidis, various Bacillus species, and yeasts
such as Candida are common examples of normal skin
microbes. Though normal, they are not always innocuous. One member of the skin’s resident microbiota—the
Gram-positive, anaerobic rod Propionibacterium acnes—
causes acne, a very visible plague of adolescence. During
the teen years, increased hormonal activity stimulates oil
production by the sebaceous glands (Fig. 23.2). P. acnes

readily degrades the triglycerides in this oil, turning
them into free fatty acids that then promote inf lammation of the gland. One consequence of the inf lammatory
response is the formation of a blackhead, a plug of f luid
and keratin that forms in the gland duct. The result is
the typical skin eruptions of acne. Because of its microbial basis, treatments for acne include tetracycline (oral)
or clindamycin (topically applied) to kill the bacteria.

Within hours after birth, a human infant’s mouth becomes
colonized with nonpathogenic Neisseria species (Gramnegative cocci), Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Lactobacillus (all Gram-positive), and some yeasts. These organisms
come from the environment surrounding the newborn,
such as the mother’s skin and garments. As teeth emerge in
the newborn, the anaerobic space between teeth and gums
supports the growth of anaerobes, such as Prevotella and
Fusobacterium (Fig. 23.3B and C). Whatever the organism, colonizers of the oral cavity must be able to adhere to
surfaces, like teeth and gums, to avoid mechanical removal
and flushing into the acidic stomach. The teeth and gingival crevices are colonized by over 500 species of bacteria.
Organisms such as Streptococcus mutans (which
attaches to tooth enamel) and Streptococcus salivarius
(which binds gingival surfaces) form a glycocalyx that
enables them to firmly adhere to oral surfaces and to
each other. They are but two of the microbes that lead to
dental plaque formation. The acidic fermentation products of these organisms demineralize teeth and cause
dental caries (tooth decay).
Important microbial habitats of the throat include the
nasopharynx, which is the area leading from the nose to
the oral cavity, and the oropharynx, which lies between the

The eye is exposed to the outside environment, so is it
heavily colonized? Actually, it’s not, because colonization
is inhibited by the presence of antimicrobial factors, such
as lysozyme, in the tears that continually rinse the eye surface (conjunctiva). Despite this protection, a few transient
commensal bacteria can be found on the conjunctiva. Skin
microbiota such as Staphylococcus epidermidis and diphtheroids (Gram-positive rods that look like clubs), as well as
some Gram-negative rods, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Proteus, manage, at least temporarily, to make
the eye their home without causing damage. (The traits of
these genera were discussed in Chapter 18.) Occasionally,
bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus
influenzae, as well as some viruses, can cause an ocular disease known as pinkeye, in which the eye becomes reddened
with a watery discharge.

Organisms like Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis populate these sites. The nasopharynx and oropharynx can also harbor relatively harmless streptococci such
as Streptococcus salivarius and Streptococcus oralis, as well as
Streptococcus mutans, a major cause of tooth decay. Other
oropharyngeal organisms include a large number of diphtheroids and the small Gram-negative rod Moraxella catarrhalis.

proximity to the outside world—normally contains Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species, and some members of Enterobacteriaceae. Some of these organisms can
cause bladder disease (known as urinary tract infection, or
UTI) if they make their way into the bladder (for example,
via catheterization).
The large surface area and associated secretions of the
female genital tract make it a rich environment for microbes,
including bacteria and yeasts. Firmicutes are the largest bacterial contributor to the vaginal microbiome; however, composition changes with the menstrual cycle, owing
to changing nutrients and pH. The mildly acidic nature
of vaginal secretions (approximately pH 4.5) discourages
the growth of many bacteria. As a result, the acid-tolerant
Lactobacillus crispatus is among the most populous vaginal species. Healthy women appear to fall into two broad
categories: 70% have lactobacillus as the primary member
of their vaginal microbiota, while 30% have mixed species
with few lactobacilli. Women in the latter group appear to
be more susceptible to sexually transmitted infections.
The balance between different species that comprise
vaginal microbiota is crucial to preventing disease. Antibiotic therapy to treat an infection anywhere in the body
can also affect the vaginal microbiota. The resulting imbalance can allow overgrowth of Candida albicans, otherwise
known as a yeast infection. C. albicans, as a fungus, is not
susceptible to antibiotics designed to kill bacteria.

Stomach

We have known for a hundred years that the stomach contents are acidic and that gastric acidity can kill bacteria. Just
how important that acidity is for protection against microbes
is illustrated by the infection caused by Vibrio cholerae, the
causative agent of cholera. Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease endemic to many of the poorer countries of the world.
Although cholera actually affects the intestines, not the stomach, the bacteria must survive passage through the stomach to
reach the intestines. The organism, however, is extremely acid
sensitive. Healthy volunteers must ingest a trillion organisms
before contracting disease. Despite the high infectious dose,
cholera epidemics in developing countries kill tens of thousands of people every year. Part of the reason is that the poor,
malnourished populations in these countries suffer from hypochlorhydria (decreased stomach acid). The less-acidic stomach gives ingested microbes more time to enter the intestine,
where they can thrive and cause devastating disease. Compare
the astronomical number of acid-sensitive V. cholerae needed
to cause disease to the mere ten organisms needed to develop
disease from Shigella, a very acid-resistant pathogen.
Although the stomach contents are very acidic, the mucous
lining of the stomach is much less so. It is there that some bacteria can take refuge, primarily Actinobacteria and Firmicutes

(see Fig. 23.1). In fact, the stomach harbors a diverse microbiota, as detected using cultural and molecular techniques.
Estimates are between 10 and 1,000 organisms per gram.
A classic stomach pathogen is Helicobacter pylori. This
organism has a remarkable ability to resist acidic pH. (It survives at pH 1, using the enzyme urease to generate ammonia,
which neutralizes acid.) However, H. pylori will not grow in
strong acid pH conditions, but it can grow in the mucous lining of the stomach, where the pH is closer to 5 or 6 (Fig. 23.6).
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
estimates that Helicobacter colonizes the stomachs of half the
world’s population. Most of the time, Helicobacter does not
cause any apparent problem, but on occasion, the organism
can produce gastric ulcers and even cancer. On the plus side,
recent data suggests that H. pylori colonization in children is
associated with a reduced risk for allergic disease.

Intestine

The intestine is an extremely long tube consisting of
several sections, each of which supports the growth of
different combinations of bacterial species. Pancreatic
secretions (at pH 10) enter the intestine at a point just
past the stomach and raise the intestinal pH to about
pH 8, which immediately relieves the acid stress placed
on microbes. The relatively high pH and bile content of

Benefits and Risks
of Microbiota

Our colonizing microbes are not hostile armies camped at
our body’s gates (also called portals of entry) waiting to
invade. These microorganisms are of great benefit to us,
and we, as good hosts, reciprocate. Microbes in our gut, for
instance, have enzymes to catabolize foods that we cannot
digest. Some bacteria synthesize vitamins that we cannot
make (E. coli, for instance, makes vitamin B12). In addition,
chemical signals released by members of the microbiome
promote host tissue development. Germ-free animals raised
in laboratories, for instance, have very thin intestinal walls.
The short-chain fatty acid products of fermentation affect

host gene expression and can influence host immune system
function. Acetate, for instance, tends to promote inflammation, whereas butyrate tends to inhibit inflammation.
We, for our part, maintain our gut microbiome by secreting complex carbohydrates that members of the microbiome can use, and chemical factors, such as hormones, that
can alter microbiome gene expression.

Examples of Beneficial Gut Microbiota

An important gut microbe that promotes host tissue rejuvenation is Akkermansia muciniphila, a Gram-negative, anaerobic
bacterium (Verrucomicrobia phylum) that degrades mucin,
the glycosylated protein layer that covers gut epithelium.
Mucin degradation by A. muciniphila fosters continuous
rejuvenation of the protective mucin layer. The short-chain
fatty acids produced by this organism feed epithelial metabolism and modulate inflammatory responses of immune cells.
A well-studied model anaerobe, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, benefits us by breaking down the complex carbohydrates we eat. Much of this organism’s genome is dedicated
to taking many of the complex carbohydrates we eat and
breaking them down into products that can be absorbed by
the body or used by other members of the microbiome. We
humans actually absorb 15%–20% of our daily caloric intake
in this way. A detailed example is discussed in Chapter 21.
Other benefits our microbiota provide include limiting
infections by competing with pathogens for food sources
and attachment receptors on host cells. Colonizing bacteria
can also make antimicrobial compounds that limit growth
of potential pathogens. For example, nonpathogenic gut E.
coli produces bacteriocin (a secreted protein toxin), which
directly inhibits growth of the related pathogen enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC; see Chapter 25).
Gut microbes also influence the development and efficiency of our immune system. A polysaccharide produced
by Bacteroides fragilis stimulates production of an antiinflammatory cytokine that will prevent gastrointestinal colitis caused by Helicobacter hepaticus. Cytokines
are small, secreted host proteins that bind to cells of the
immune system and regulate their function. (Cytokines are
discussed in Sections 23.5 and 24.3.)
The intestinal microbe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, a member of the order Clostridiales (Firmicutes phylum), elicits powerful anti-inflammatory effects on human
immune cells through secreted bacterial factors and interactions with Toll-like receptors (see Section 23.5). For
example, it inhibits induction of the inflammatory cytokine
IL-8 and increases the population of an anti-inflammatory
T-cell lymphocyte population (T regulatory cells; see Chapter 24). The absence of this organism in human intestines
has been linked to painful inflammatory intestinal diseases
such as Crohn’s disease.

Another important group of intestinal anaerobes consists of the segmented filamentous bacilli (SFBs) in mice and
probably humans (see Special Topic 18.1). These spore formers are important for developing a healthy immune system.
We will discuss the connections between gut microbiota
and the immune system more fully in Chapter 24. The antiinflammatory effects of these and other microbes protect the
intestinal mucosa from an overzealous immune system.

Containment Breaches and
Disrupted Balance

Everything works well, as long as the composition of our
microbiota is balanced and stays where it belongs. However, the accidental penetration of certain organisms
beyond a site of colonization or an imbalance in microbiome composition, called dysbiosis, can cause infections and inflammatory diseases, respectively. A cancerous
lesion in the colon, for example, can provide a passageway for microbes to enter deeper tissues and cause infection. Bacteroides fragilis, a harmless anaerobe in the gut,
can invade tissues through surgical wounds, causing intraabdominal abscesses and even gangrene after abdominal
surgery (Fig. 23.9). Other infections caused by specific
gut microbes escaping the intestine include urinary tract
infections (cystitis), septicemia, and meningitis.
Emotional stress, a change in diet, or antibiotic therapy
can alter gut microbiome balance. The resultant dysbiosis can
lead to poor digestion, pseudomembranous enterocolitis [an
infectious disease caused by Clostridioides difficile (formerly
Clostridium difficile)] (Fig. 23.10), or an extremely painful

Some people favor restoring natural microbial balance by

(from the Greek meaning “for life”), is thought to restore
balance to the microbial community and return the host
to good health. The most commonly used probiotic genera are Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium (Fig. 23.11).

Claire Fraser and colleagues at the University of Maryland School of Medicine recently showed that ingestion of
a single probiotic microbe, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG,
does not alter microbiome composition but will orchestrate broad transcriptional changes in other members
of the microbiome—functions that could promote antiinflammatory pathways in the resident microbes.
Probiotics are now being tested for treating several gastrointestinal disorders, including inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD). Realize, though, that using probiotics such as yogurt
to treat complex diseases such as IBD is still very controversial.
An extreme, but clinically proven, form of delivering probiotic microbes to the intestine is the so-called fecal transplant
(fecal bacteriotherapy). In its original forms fecal transplant
transferred the intestinal microbiome of a healthy person to a
relative with a severe intestinal disease such as pseudomembranous enterocolitis. Restoring a “normal” microbiome in this
way has successfully “cured” patients with repeated C. difficile infections that did not respond to antibiotics. Today the
procedure uses a “super donor” rather than relatives and may
someday be a personalized bacterial cocktail delivered in pill
form. Probiotics in the form of vaginal suppositories are also
used to treat patients prone to vaginal infections.

The Link between Obesity and Dysbiosis

Obesity is epidemic in industrialized and developing countries.
Over 500 million people worldwide are obese and predisposed to develop related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, cancer, and
some immune disorders. Obesity involves complex, puzzlelike interactions among genes, diet, and a long-term imbalance

between energy intake and expenditure, which together
yield an excessive increase in body fat. Compelling evidence now points to gut microbiota playing a prominent
role in obesity by influencing nutrient acquisition, regulating energy metabolism, and affecting fat storage.
Many studies showing connections between gut
microbiota and obesity use gnotobiotic animals. A gnotobiotic animal is an animal that is germ-free or one in
which all the microbial species present are known. To
develop a gnotobiotic colony of animals, offspring must
be delivered by cesarean section under aseptic conditions in an isolator. The newborn is moved to a separate isolator where all entering air, water, and food are
sterilized. Once gnotobiotic animals are established,
the colony is maintained by normal mating between
the members. Fecal organisms and fecal content can
be transplanted orally to these animals by syringe and
stomach tube (gavage). After the transplant, the effects
on animal physiology and disease can be observed.
Fecal transplants include mouse-to-mouse transfers or
even human-to-mouse transfers (discussed later).
Early evidence suggesting a link between the gut
microbiome and obesity included finding that germfree (GF) mice have less fat and are more resistant to
diet-induced obesity, compared to conventionally raised
(microbiome-containing) mice. Furthermore, treating
obese mice with antibiotics reduces their body weight
and improves glucose metabolism. Livestock farmers
and cattle ranchers have known for decades that adding
antibiotics in low doses to animal feed actually increases
animal growth. These studies suggest that altering an
animal’s microbiome with antibiotics can increase or
decrease weight depending on circumstances.
Newer metagenomic studies find that obese humans

an increased capacity to absorb energy compared to their
lean counterparts. The ratios of major bacterial phyla in the
colon also seem to differ between obese and lean individuals.
For instance, the gut microbiomes of obese children have
Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes phylum ratios that are higher
than those of lean children. Studies looking at this ratio
among adults are less clear. Some find that obese adults have
higher Firmicutes-to-Bacteroidetes ratios compared to lean
adults. Other studies indicate the opposite, and some show
no difference. The real key to microbiome effects on obesity
may be the difference in species makeup and metabolic output rather than broad phylum differences.
Can your microbiome keep you thin? A landmark study

from Jeffrey Gordon (Fig. 23.12; Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis) and colleagues demonstrated that obesity in humans is clearly linked to their

Generally, acetate is thought to promote obesity. Acetate
is absorbed well by intestinal epithelial cells, travels to the
liver where it is used for lipid synthesis, and is distributed
throughout the body to be used as a substrate for cholesterol
synthesis (particularly in adipose tissues). Butyrate, however, seems to prevent obesity. It is used primarily by intestinal epithelial cells for energy and stimulates production
of gut hormones that limit hunger. Butyrate also reduces
the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferongamma (IFN-gamma), described in Sections 23.5 and
24.3. Propionate, for its part, has effects that can either
stimulate or prevent obesity. This SCFA stimulates IFNgamma synthesis, which promotes inflammation associated
with obesity. But propionate is also involved in gluconeogenesis, which diverts fatty acids away from cholesterol
synthesis and toward glucose synthesis. It also stimulates
the production of gut hormones that limit hunger, both
of which are anti-obesity effects. So, is there a correlation
between SCFA levels in the colon and obesity?
A study from Elena Comelli’s lab at the University of
Toronto found that a cohort of obese or overweight patients
generally had higher levels of SCFAs (propionate, butyrate, and acetate) than did healthy lean patients on similar
diets, and that SCFA levels did correlate to Firmicutes/
Bacteroidetes ratios. The more Firmicutes there were, the
more SCFAs were produced. However, obese and lean subjects actually had similar Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratios,
suggesting that the most important factor is which species
of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are present (and what they
are doing), rather than the overall phylum ratios.

Archaea in the gut might also tilt metabolic balance toward obesity. About 50% of humans have significant numbers of methane-producing archaea, primarily
Methanobrevibacter smithii (discussed in Chapter 21).
This archaeon can comprise up to 10% of the anaerobes
in the colons of healthy adults. Bruce Rittmann and colleagues from Arizona State University compared the numbers of Bacteria and Archaea in normal-weight, obese, and
post-gastric-bypass patients (Fig. 23.15). They discovered
that all three groups had highly diverse species of bacteria, but the obese group had significantly more archaea
than either the lean or gastric-bypass patients. This finding raised the possibility that Archaea may play a role in
obesity. But how?
One possible explanation comes from another study
by Jeffrey Gordon’s laboratory. His team colonized germfree mice with either Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron or
Methanobrevibacter smithii, or with both species together,
and found that when co-colonized, the methanogen dramatically altered the transcriptome of B. thetaiotaomicron.
The methanogen shifted the carbohydrate priority of Bacteroides from glucans to fructans and enticed more acetate production as a result. Higher levels of acetate could
enhance adiposity as outlined already. How the archaeon
modulated the anaerobe’s metabolism is not known, but it
may involve some form of quorum sensing.
In addition to energy harvesting, inflammation induced
by gut microbes appears to influence the development of
obesity and diabetes. Obese individuals are in a chronic
state of low-grade inflammation, characterized by elevated

CHAPTER 23

blood and tissue levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and
markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (discussed in Section 23.6). The source of inflammation is
thought to be outer membrane lipopolysaccharides (LPS),
also called endotoxin, produced by Gram-negative members
of the gut microbiome. A high-fat diet promotes absorption of endotoxin across the intestinal epithelium and its
distribution to tissues via blood. LPS interacts with a cell
receptor called TLR4, present in a variety of host cells (see
Section 23.5). LPS-TLR4 interaction induces production
of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, and reactive
oxygen species that interfere with the normal metabolism of liver, adipose, and skeletal muscle; all of which are
important to the regulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis. While some gut bacterial groups correlate with energy
intake, others, such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, influence obesity by altering inflammation. The presence of F.
prausnitzii, for example, reduces the low-grade inflammation associated with obesity and diabetes.
Can individual members of a lean-associated microbiome
treat obesity? We have gained tremendous insight into

host-microbe relationships from the various microbiome
projects under way. The data obtained thus far suggest that
different blends of microbiota influence the efficiency of
calorie harvesting from the diet, alter how derived energy is
stored, and modulate chronic inflammatory processes. But
can we pick out individual microbes or blends of microbes
to treat obesity or other gastrointestinal diseases?
Research is under way to identify individual members of
the microbiome that might individually, or in combination,
treat diseases such as IBS (irritable bowel syndrome), IBD,
or perhaps obesity. For example, Section 7.6 describes the
identification of the intestinal Firmicute Christensenella
minuta from human twins, which prevents weight gain
when transferred to germ-free mice. There is great hope
that we may one day cure or prevent these disorders using
this novel form of probiotic treatment.

To Summarize

Benefits of the microbiome include interfering with
pathogen colonization, producing immunomodulatory
proteins, metabolizing foods that the host cannot process (energy harvesting), producing vitamins that the
host cannot make, and honing our immune system.
Infections such as sepsis, abscesses, cystitis, and meningitis can be caused by some members of the microbiota if they breach the body’s containment mechanisms.
Dysbiosis of the microbiome can contribute to infection, obesity, and inflammatory and autoimmune
diseases.

Probiotics are foods, or solutions, containing helpful members of a microbiome. Different probiotics can
restore balance to the intestinal or vaginal microbiomes.
Obesity has been linked to intestinal dysbiosis. An
increase in species able to harvest energy from ingested
foods and a decrease in species that temper inflammation
are involved.

23.3

Overview of the
Immune System

Given that we are surrounded by and host numerous bacteria, how is it we are not constantly infected? Here we begin
our discussion of the many layers of protection designed
to prevent infection and disease. As you will see, numerous physical and chemical barriers provide an effective first
line of defense against infection by invading microbes. As
such, they play a critical role in managing our resident ecosystems. But these barriers are not unbreachable. Organisms can still slip through. Consequently, humans, as well
as other mammals, have a more aggressive defense called
the immune system. The immune system is an integrated
system of organs, tissues, cells, and cell products that differentiates self from nonself and neutralizes potentially
pathogenic organisms or substances. This complex collection of cells and soluble proteins is capable of responding to
nearly any foreign molecular structure.

Innate and Adaptive Immunity

There are two broad types of immunity: innate immunity (often called nonadaptive immunity) and adaptive
immunity (discussed in detail in Chapter 24). Innate and
adaptive immunity have several key differences. Innate
immunity includes physical barriers such as skin, chemical barriers such as stomach acid, and relatively nonspecific
cellular responses to infection that engage if the physical
and chemical barriers are breached. The cellular innate
responses are triggered by microbial structures such as peptidoglycan and lipopolysaccharides. Innate immunity is
essentially “hardwired” into the body. It is present at birth,
so that mechanisms of innate immunity exist before the
body ever encounters a microbe. The protection afforded
by innate immunity is nonspecific, capable of blocking or
attacking many different types of foreign substances and
organisms.
In contrast to innate immunity, adaptive immunity is
designed to react to very specific structures called antigens.
An antigen is any chemical, compound, or structure foreign
to the body that elicits an immune response. The adaptive

■

PART 5

■

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

immune response to a specific antigen is not launched until
the body “sees” that antigen. Adaptive immune mechanisms can recognize at least 1010 different antigenic structures and specifically launch a directed attack against each
one. Once such an attack has been activated, the organism
keeps a “memory” of the exposure in the form of specific
memory cells, and an encounter with the microbe years
later will reactivate the memory cells specific to the antigen.
The two types of immunity are illustrated by the
response of the immune system to infection by the microorganism Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which causes the sexually
transmitted disease gonorrhea. A component of the innate
immune response is complement, composed of several soluble protein factors constantly present in the blood. Within
moments of an initial infection, especially upon entering
the bloodstream, complement proteins form holes in the
bacterial membrane, thereby killing the microbe (see Section 23.6). Over time, the adaptive immune response will
generate specific antibodies made to the cells of N. gonorrhoeae that escaped the innate mechanisms. These antibodies, however, are not made until well after the organism
infects a person. Together, innate and adaptive immunity
can help ward off disease caused by this organism. Unfortunately, N. gonorrhoeae infection does not generate good
“memory,” so reinfection with this organism is possible.
It is important to know that the innate and adaptive
immune systems are interconnected. Antibodies made by
the adaptive immune system will trigger parts of the innate
immune system, such as the complement cascade that we
will discuss later. Likewise, activation of innate resistance
mechanisms will cause the release of small immunomodulatory peptides (cytokines) that influence the type and
strength of adaptive immunity brought to bear. In military
terms, it is similar to the army coordinating its actions with
those of the air and naval forces.

Infection versus Disease

Contact with an infectious agent does not guarantee that a
person will actually contract the disease. If the number of
infecting organisms is small and the immune system (innate
and adaptive) is effective, the individual may not develop
disease, although a person known to have been exposed to
certain microorganisms will be treated with antibiotics as
a preventive measure. Chapter 26 more fully discusses the
difference between being infected and having a disease.
Any microbe that launches a successful attack on a
human or other animal and causes disease must first breach
the host’s physical and chemical barriers to gain entrance to
the body. It must then survive the innate defense mechanisms and begin to multiply. Finally, the microbe must surmount the last line of defense, adaptive immunity, which
begins to respond as the microbe struggles to overcome

innate immune defenses. The rest of this chapter will discuss the various innate defense mechanisms. Adaptive
immunity is discussed in Chapter 24.
Although innate and adaptive immunity are often
treated as separate entities, certain kinds of cells and organs
play a role in both types of immunity. We thus introduce
various cells and organs of the immune system as a whole
before focusing on innate immunity. Our coverage of
innate immunity will include physical and chemical barriers
to infection, inflammation and nonspecific killing through
phagocytosis, neutrophil extracellular traps, interferon,
natural killer cells, and complement.

Cells of the Immune System

Blood is composed of red blood cells, white blood cells (also
generally known as leukocytes), and platelets (Fig. 23.16).
The many types of white blood cells are formed by the
differentiation of stem cells produced in bone marrow
(Fig. 23.17). Among these white blood cells are various
components of innate immunity that differentiated from
myeloid stem cells. These differentiated cells include:

SPECIAL TOPIC 23.1. .Are

NETs a Cause of Lupus?

It started with slight joint pain in her hands. Then, within
weeks, Annette developed searing pain in all her joints. Blood
tests revealed that Annette had systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease in which the immune system can mistakenly attack any part of the body. The name
“lupus” (Greek for “wolf”) comes from a butterfly-shaped
facial rash that resembles the pattern of fur on a wolf’s face
(Fig. 1). In addition to joint pain and skin rashes, SLE patients
may have heart arrhythmias, abdominal pain, difficulty breathing, fatigue, fever, and swollen lymph nodes—depending on
which parts of the body are under attack.
An important test used to diagnose lupus looks for antinuclear antibodies in the patient’s blood. Antibodies are small
proteins that usually bind substances foreign to the body
(see Chapter 24). Lupus patients, however, are autoreactive,
so they make antibodies to their own DNA and other “self”
proteins.
The mechanisms underlying SLE are complex and not
fully defined. One component that seems important is the
production of type I interferons. In addition to their role in
inhibiting viral replication, type I interferons increase the lytic
potential of natural killer cells (see Section 23.5) and stimulate the development of cytotoxic lymphocytes (via TH1 cells,
as discussed in Chapter 24). Both cell types can cause tissue
damage. Type I interferons can also lower the “threshold” for

making autoreactive antibodies. But what leads to increased
interferon production in lupus patients?
Recent evidence suggests that a unique subset of neutrophils present in all lupus patients can initiate a cycle of pronounced interferon production via NET formation. Figure 2
illustrates that these special neutrophils, called low-density
granulocytes (LDGs), more easily undergo NETosis, as compared to typical healthy control neutrophils or to normaldensity neutrophils from lupus patients. NETosis generates
an ample source of autoantigen, such as chromatin, to which
autoantibodies can be made, and helps propagate tissue
damage, especially to blood vessel endothelial cells, by NETentangled peroxidases and proteases.
But what stimulates interferon production? Autoantibodies that bind to antimicrobial peptides like LL-37 embedded
in NETs promote transport of DNA into circulating plasmacytoid dendritic cells, a primary source of interferon-alpha. The
subsequent interaction between DNA and Toll-like receptor 9
(TLR9 binds to CpG sequences in DNA) on these cells stimulates interferon-alpha production. Interferon-alpha not only
enhances natural killer (NK) cell and cytotoxic lymphocyte
activity, but also amplifies NET release by other LDGs (Fig. 3).
The end result is a cycle of inflammation and tissue damage that contributes to the symptoms of SLE. Stopping NET
release by LDGs could be a way to lessen those symptoms.

RESEARCH QUESTION
DR. KEN GREER/VISUALS UNLIMITED, INC.

How would you determine whether NET formation by LDGs
really stimulates interferon-alpha production by plasmacytoid
dendritic cells? Design an experiment using components of
the system and wells of a microtiter plate.

into the phagosome will destroy various components
of the microbe and, ultimately, the microbe itself (see
Section 23.5).
Neutrophils also “throw” neutrophil extracellular
traps (NETs) around nearby pathogens. After interacting with bacteria, neutrophils can undergo an unusual
form of cell death, called NETosis, that spews a latticework of DNA (chromatin) impregnated with antimicrobial
compounds into the immediate area (Fig. 23.20). Much
as a fisherman’s net traps fish, NETs trap pathogens and
prevent them from spreading. Antimicrobial compounds

diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (Special

Basophils, which stain with basic dyes, and eosinophils (Fig. 23.18B), which stain with the acidic dye eosin,
do not phagocytose microbes or throw NETs, but release
products, such as major basic protein, that are toxic to
the microbe. These two types of blood cells also release
chemical mediators (called vasoactive agents) that affect
the diameter and permeability of blood vessels (the significance of which is discussed in Section 23.5). Eosinophils play a major role in killing multicellular parasites such
as helminth worms. Mast cells are similar to basophils
in structure but differentiate in a lineage separate from

PMNs. Unlike PMNs, mast cells are residents of connective tissues and mucosa and do not circulate in the bloodstream. Basophils and mast cells also contain high-affinity
receptors for a class of antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE) associated with allergic responses (detailed in
Section 24.7).

Note:

Because neutrophils constitute the vast majority of PMNs, the terms “neutrophil” and “PMN” are often used
interchangeably.

Monocytes (Fig. 23.18C) are white blood cells with a
single nucleus (not multilobed like a PMN); they engulf
(phagocytose) foreign material. Monocytes circulating in
the blood can migrate out of blood vessels into various
tissues and differentiate into macrophages and dendritic
cells (Fig. 23.21). Macrophages are phagocytic and form
a major part of the amorphous reticuloendothelial system, which is widely distributed throughout the body. The
reticuloendothelial system is a group of cells with the ability to take up and sequester particles. In addition to macrophages, the system is composed of specialized endothelial
cells lining the sinusoids (special capillaries) of the liver
(Kupffer cells), spleen, and bone marrow, as well as reticular
cells of lymphatic tissue (macrophages) and of bone marrow
(fibroblasts). The function of macrophages and the reticuloendothelial system is to phagocytose microorganisms.
Macrophages are present in most tissues of the body and
are the cells most likely to make first contact with invading pathogens. They have two functions. As part of innate
immunity, they kill invaders directly. Protrusions from the

macrophage surface extend and clasp nearby bacteria, pulling them into the cell (Fig. 23.21A). Once ingested by the
macrophage, the bacteria are destroyed. Subsequently, as
the first step in adaptive immunity, the remnants are processed (degraded) into smaller peptides (called antigens),
which are then presented on the macrophage cell surface.
Specific white blood cells called T cells (a type of lymphocyte; see Chapter 24) can bind the displayed antigens and
become activated as part of the adaptive immune response.
Thus, macrophages are considered antigen-presenting
cells (APCs; see Chapter 24).

the outside of the cell membrane. MHC I is an indicator
of “self.” (MHC II molecules are discussed in Chapter 24.)
NK cells have specific receptors that bind to self MHC I
molecules on the surfaces of other cells in the body. An
NK cell that “touches” a self MHC I–containing cell from
the same person will not attack that cell. However, if a
host cell lacks MHC class I molecules, NK cells perceive
the target as foreign and a potential threat. Host cells can
lose their MHC molecules during infection or as a result
of malignant transformation. When an NK cell encounters a host cell lacking these markers, the NK cell inserts a
pore-forming protein (perforin) into the membrane of the
target cell, through which cytotoxic enzymes are delivered.
Natural killer cells also contain antibody Fc receptors on their cell surface. The second killing mechanism,
called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC), is activated when the Fc receptor on the NK cell
links to an antibody-coated host cell. Why would host cells
be coated with antibodies? During their replication, many
viruses place viral proteins in the membrane of the infected
cell. Antibodies to those viral proteins will coat the compromised cell, tagging it for ADCC. Once the compromised cell has been targeted, it is killed by the NK cell in
the same way as described for cells lacking MHC—namely,
by insertion of a perforin molecule. This killing mechanism is another example of cooperation between innate
immunity (NK cells) and adaptive immunity (antibodyproducing lymphocytes).
Diagnostic value of white blood cell ratios. Many diseases,

including infections, can alter the ratios of white blood
cells (WBCs). A WBC differential is a test that physicians
often order to help them diagnose infections and other syndromes. Table 23.1 presents general guidelines for interpreting a WBC differential, indicating which cell types
increase or decrease in response to infections with
bacteria, viruses, or parasites (protozoa or worms).
Notice that total WBC counts increase in each case,
but the type of WBC that increases in number differs with the infectious agent.

EYE OF SCIENCE/SCIENCE SOURCE

Macrophages are not the only APCs; dendritic cells
(Fig 23.21B) are also APCs. Present in the spleen and
lymph nodes, they, like macrophages, can take up, process,
and present small antigens on their cell surface. Dendritic
cells are different from macrophages in structure and in the
fact that dendritic cells primarily take up small soluble antigens from their surroundings in addition to phagocytosing
whole bacteria.
Platelets are small, puzzle piece–shaped cell fragments
(they lack a nucleus) that derive from megakaryocytes, cells
that differentiate from the precursors of red blood cells.
Platelets, which circulate in the bloodstream, are required
for efficient blood clotting. When activated by damaged
endothelial cells (cells lining blood vessels), platelets clump,
become trapped by fibrin, and form plugs that stop bleeding. Several factors produced by platelets also help wound
repair. In addition to mediating blood clots and wound
repair, recent evidence shows that platelets are part of the
innate immune system. Invading bacteria can bind platelets and trigger the release of antimicrobial peptides (see
Section 23.4). Bacterially activated platelets can also induce
NET formation by neutrophils.
Natural killer (NK) cells derive from the lymphoid
stem cells shown in Figure 23.17 and are also part of
innate immunity. Instead of killing microbes, however, the
mission of NK cells is to kill host cells that harbor microorganisms or that have been transformed into cancer cells
(Fig. 23.22). Natural killer cells recognize changes in cellsurface proteins of infected or cancer cells (MHC class I
molecules; see Section 24.3) and then degranulate to
release chemicals that kill those cells.
Natural killer cells recognize their targets in two basic
ways: by the absence of MHC class I molecules on host
cells, or by the presence of antibodies on host cells. A normal host cell displays two classes of MHC molecules on

described earlier. Lymphocytes (Fig. 23.18D),
which are the main participants in adaptive immunity, are present in blood at about 2,500 cells per
microliter, accounting for over one-third of all
peripheral white blood cells. However, an individual lymphocyte spends most of its life within specialized solid tissues (lymphoid organs) and enters
the bloodstream only periodically, where it migrates

from one place to another, surveying tissues for possible
infection or foreign antigens. Consequently, most lymphocytes are found in the lymph nodes or spleen. No more
than 1% of the total lymphocyte population circulates in
the blood at any one time.
The tissues of the immune system, where the great
majority of lymphocytes are found, are classified as primary
or secondary lymphoid organs or tissues, depending on
their function (Fig. 23.23). The primary lymphoid organs
and tissues are where immature lymphocytes mature into
antigen-sensitive B cells and T cells. B cells, which ultimately produce antibodies (see Chapter 24), develop in
bone marrow tissue. whereas T cells, which modulate various facets of adaptive immunity, develop in the thymus, an
organ located above the heart.
The secondary lymphoid organs serve as stations where
lymphocytes can encounter antigens. These encounters
lead to the differentiation of B cells into antibody-secreting
plasma cells, and of T cells into antigen-specific helper cells,
as will be discussed in Chapter 24. The spleen is an example of a secondary lymphoid organ. It is designed to filter
blood directly and detect microorganisms. Macrophages in
the spleen engulf these organisms and destroy them, and
then migrate to other secondary lymphoid organs and present pieces of the microbe (called antigens) to the B and
T cells, which then become activated.
The lymph nodes are another kind of secondary lymphoid organ. Lymph nodes are arranged to trap organisms from local tissues, not from blood. Lymph nodes are
situated at various sites in the body where lymphatic vessels converge (for example, under the armpits). Lymphoid
tissues are also present in the mucosal regions of the gut
and respiratory tracts (for example, Peyer’s patches and
gut-associated lymphoid tissue, or GALT, discussed later).
Other secondary lymphoid organs are the tonsils, adenoids,
and appendix.

■

The immune system consists of both innate and adaptive mechanisms that recognize and eliminate pathogens.
Innate immunity includes physical and chemical barriers and some cellular responses to various microbial
structures.
Adaptive immunity is a cellular response to specific
structures (antigens) in which a memory of exposure is
produced.
Myeloid bone marrow stem cells differentiate to form
cells of the innate immune system—namely, phagocytic
PMNs, monocytes, macrophages, antigen-presenting
dendritic cells, and mast cells. Platelets are derived from
a different cell line.
Lymphoid stem cells differentiate into natural killer
cells (part of the innate immune system) and lymphocytes (cells of the adaptive immune system). Lymphocytes are classified as B cells, which ultimately
produce antibodies, and T cells, which regulate adaptive immunity.
Natural killer (NK) cells are a class of white blood
cells that continually patrol tissues for cancer cells, cells
infected with microbes, or host cells coated with antibody (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity,
ADCC). NK cells kill by inserting pores of perforin
into target cell membranes.
Primary lymphoid organs include bone marrow (where
B cells develop) and the thymus (where T cells develop).
Secondary lymphoid organs (spleen, lymph nodes,
Peyer’s patches, tonsils, appendix) are where lymphocytes
encounter antigens.

The first line of defense against any potential microbial invader (either commensal or pathogenic) is found
where parts of the body interface with the environment. These interfaces (skin, lung, gastrointestinal
tract, genitourinary tract, and oral cavities) have similar
defense strategies, although each has unique characteristics. A defense common to all host surfaces involves
tight junctions—watertight adhesions that link adjacent epithelial cells at mucosal surfaces and endothelial
cells lining blood vessels. Tight junctions prevent bacteria, and even host cells, from moving between internal
and external host compartments. The “glue” that holds
tight junctions together is a series of interconnecting
glycoprotein molecules (Fig. 23.24).

Physical and Chemical
Defenses against Infection

When defending a castle in medieval times, the first lines of
defense included physical barriers (the castle wall), chemical barriers (boiling oil tossed onto invaders trying to scale
the wall), and finally, hand-to-hand combat once the wall
was breached. Similarly, the body’s initial defenses against

of the thick keratin armor produced by closely packed
cells called keratinocytes. Keratin protein is a hard substance (hair and fi ngernails are made of it) that is not
degraded by known microbial enzymes. An oily substance (sebum) produced by the sebaceous glands also
covers and protects the skin. Its slightly acidic pH inhibits bacterial growth. Competition between species also
limits colonization by pathogens, and microorganisms
that manage to adhere are continually removed by the
constant shedding of outer epithelial skin layers.
Other, more specialized cells just under the skin can
recognize microbes managing to slip through the physical barrier. They are part of a consortium of cells called
skin-associated lymphoid tissue (SALT). Langerhans cells make up a significant portion of SALT.
They are specialized dendritic cells that can phagocytose microbes. Once a lymphoid Langerhans cell
has ingested a microbe, the cell migrates by ameboid
movement to nearby lymph nodes and presents parts of the
microbe to the immune system to activate antimicrobial
immunity.

Note:

Do not confuse phagocytic Langerhans cells with the
pancreatic “islets of Langerhans,” which secrete insulin.

Mucous membranes. Mucosal surfaces form the largest
interface (200–300 square meters) between the human host
and the environment (the intestine alone is 7–8 meters, or

of mucosal immunity to pathogens. However, M cells can
also serve as a portal for some pathogens to gain entry to
the body.

Like skin, the gastrointestinal system possesses an
innate mucosal immune system, in this case called gutassociated lymphoid tissue (GALT). GALT includes
tonsils, adenoids, and Peyer’s patches (Fig. 23.25A).
These tissues include specialized M cells that dot the
intestinal surface and are wedged between epithelial cells.
“M” stands for “microfold,” which describes their appearance (Fig. 23.25B). These are fixed cells that take up
microbes (microbiota or pathogens) from the intestine
and release them, or pieces of them, into a pocket formed
on the opposite, or basolateral, side of the cell. Other
cells of the innate immune system, such as macrophages
(which migrate through tissues), gather here and collect
the organisms that emerge. Macrophages engulf and try
to kill the organism and then place small, degraded components of the organism on the macrophage cell surface,
where other immune system cells can recognize them. As a
result, M cells are extremely important for the development

The lungs. The lungs also have a formidable defense. In
addition to the mucociliary escalator discussed in Section 23.1, microorganisms larger than 100 μm become
trapped by hairs and cilia lining the nasal cavity and trigger
a forceful expulsion of air from the lungs (a sneeze). The
sneeze is designed to clear the organism from the respiratory tract. Organisms that make it to the alveoli are met by
phagocytic cells called alveolar macrophages. These cells
can ingest and kill most bacteria.
Another important factor that prevents lung infections is
an epithelial membrane protein called cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CFTR is a
membrane chloride channel that regulates chloride movement across the membrane—an essential part of hydrating
mucus in healthy individuals. Cystic fibrosis patients have
a defective CFTR and are much more susceptible to lung
infections, especially those caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The P. aeruginosa strains posing the most serious

threat produce a thick slimy material (alginate) that retards
other lung clearance mechanisms (Fig. 23.26). How
CFTR helps protect lungs from infection is not clear. One
hypothesis is that normal CFTR is a receptor for P. aeruginosa lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which enables endocytosis
and killing of the microbe by phagolysosome mechanisms.
Another hypothesis is that normal CFTR helps maintain an
airway pH optimal for the activity of secreted antimicrobial
peptides. Either way, CFTR is part of the innate barrier
guarding against lung infection.

Some examples of chemical barriers were mentioned
previously, such as the acidic pH of the stomach,
lysozyme in tears, and generators of superoxide. In
addition, a variety of human cells generate small
antimicrobial, cationic (positively charged) peptides
called defensins (Table 23.2). These antimicrobial peptides are important components of innate
immunity against microbial infections.
Defensins range in length from 29 to 47
amino acids and are found in mammals, birds,
amphibians, and plants. Defensins (and other antimicrobial peptides) destroy an invading microbe’s
cytoplasmic membrane and are effective against
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, fungi,
and even some viruses (those with membranes,
like HIV). To kill, the peptides must bind the negatively charged outer membrane lipopolysaccharides (LPS)
of Gram-negative bacteria and move into the periplasm.
Defensins are then pulled into the cytoplasmic membrane
of either Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria by the
transmembrane electrical potential, about –150 mV in bacteria (that is, the cell interior is more negative than the
exterior). The peptides assemble into channels that destroy
the cytoplasmic membrane barrier, killing the bacterial cell.
Defensins generally do not affect eukaryotic cells, which
have a much lower membrane potential (–15 mV). Antimicrobial peptides are produced by many human cells,
including cells of the skin, lungs, genitourinary tract, and
gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 23.27). Specific defensins produced by different animals may partially explain pathogenhost specificity (see eTopic 23.1).

One form of vertebrate defensins (alpha) are stored in
membrane-enclosed granules within neutrophils and in
Paneth cells in the small intestine (Fig. 23.27A). When
stimulated, these cells degranulate (release their granule
contents) by fusing their granule membranes to cytoplasmic
or vacuolar membranes, dumping their contents into the
surroundings or into phagocytic vacuoles, where the alpha
defensins can destroy engulfed microbes (Fig. 23.27B). In
contrast, the beta defensins are not stored in cytoplasmic
granules. The synthesis of beta defensins is activated only
after contact with bacteria or their products. Other cationic
antimicrobial peptides are listed in Table 23.2. Neutrophil

The boil shown in Figure 23.28 is an inflammatory

in the war between microbial invaders and their hosts. It

normally confined to the bloodstream to gain access to

infected sites within tissues. Movement of these cells out of
blood vessels is called extravasation or diapedesis, which
we discuss shortly. Once at the infection site, the neutrophils begin engulfing microbes. The white pus associated
with an infection is teeming with these white blood cells.
The five cardinal signs of inflammation, first described
over 2,000 years ago, are: redness, warmth, pain, swelling, and altered function at the affected site. In this section
we describe the pathophysiology of these signs and other
aspects of innate immunity.
Although many things can trigger inflammation,
we focus here on how microbes cause the response. The
process begins with the infection itself. Microorganisms introduced into the body—for example, on a wood
splinter—will begin to grow and produce compounds that
host cells sense or that damage host cells (Fig. 23.29 ).
Resident macrophages that wander into the infected area
engulf these organisms and then release inflammatory
mediators (chemoattractants) that “call” for more help.
These mediators include vasoactive factors such as leukotrienes, platelet-activating factor, and prostaglandins,
which act on blood vessels of the microcirculation, increasing blood volume and capillary permeability to help deliver
white blood cells to the area. In addition, small protein
molecules called cytokines are secreted, diffusing to the
vasculature and stimulating the expression of specific
receptors (selectins) on the endothelial cells of capillaries
and venules. But how are cytokines made in response to
an infection?

The faster the body can detect the
presence of pathogens, the more
quickly it can begin to deal with
them. The more quickly it deals
with them, the better the outcome
of an infection. It takes time, however, for the adaptive immune system to make antibodies specific for
a microbe (see Chapter 24). All the
while, the pathogen can grow and
cause disease. Fortunately, bacteria
and viruses possess unique structures that immediately tag them
as foreign. Structures such as peptidoglycan, flagellin, and lipoteichoic acids are not normally present
in tissues unless bacteria or viruses
are present. These structures have
microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) that can be recognized by Toll-like or NOD-like
receptors (TLRs or NLRs) present on or in various host cell types
(Fig. 23.30; Table 23.3). TLRs

upon encountering an intruder. Collectively, TLRs, NLRs,
and similar proteins are called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) because they recognize MAMPs.
Toll-like receptors. First discovered in insects and named
Toll receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are evolutionarily conserved cell-surface glycoproteins present on the cells
of many eukaryotic genera (Fig. 23.30). The term “Toll”
came from Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard’s 1985 exclamation,
“That’s crazy!” (in German, “Das ist ja toll!”), when shown
the underdeveloped posterior of a mutant fruit fly. Thus, the
gene was dubbed “Toll.” TLRs in mammals display sequence
similarities to the Toll genes involved with insect embryogenesis (Nüsslein-Volhard was co-winner of the 1995 Nobel Prize
in Physiology or Medicine for her research on the control of
embryonic development). TLRs are transmembrane proteins
with an extracellular Toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain (TIR
domain). Humans have numerous Toll-like receptors, each of
which recognizes different MAMPs present on pathogenic
microorganisms, making them an innate defense mechanism
with some degree of specificity. For example, TLR2 binds to
lipoarabinomannan from mycobacteria, zymosan from yeasts,
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from spirochetes, and peptidoglycan. TLR4, on the other hand, binds LPS, as well as host
proteins released at sites of infection (for example, heat-shock
protein 60). CD14, another host cell-surface protein, serves
as a coreceptor for LPS. Note that these receptors bind fragments of structures after they are released from the microbe.
They don’t interact with the whole organism.
Once bound to their ligands, the TLRs trigger an intracellular transcription regulatory cascade via their TIR
domain, causing the host cell to make and release cytokines that diffuse away from the site, bind to receptors on
various cells of the immune system (see Table 23.3), and
direct them to engage the invader. Cytokines are discussed
further here and in Chapter 24. The cells that respond to
cytokines can be part of innate immunity, adaptive immunity, or both. TLR recognition of MAMPs can also trigger autophagy in infected cells. Bruce Beutler and Jules
Hoffman shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or
Medicine for their work on the role of TLRs in immunity.
NOD-like receptors. While TLRs are important sensors of
external MAMPs (or of MAMPs in endosomes), NODlike receptor (NLR) proteins are important cytoplasmic
sensors of MAMPs (see Table 23.3). NLRs are structurally similar to a family of plant proteins called NODs
(nucleotide-binding oligomerization domains) that provide
resistance to pathogens. In mammals, some NLRs bound
to a MAMP send a signal to the nucleus to activate cytokine
production. Other NLRs become part of large, intracellular
complexes of proteins called inflammasomes on which the
protease caspase-1 oligomerizes (see the Current Research
Highlight). Some cytokines (IL-1β and IL-18) are made as

large, inactive precursor proteins (procytokines) that must
be processed by caspase-1 cleavage to make an active cytokine. The array of cytokines released stimulates inflammation and activates adaptive immune mechanisms.

Type I Interferons Are
“Intruder-Alert” Cytokines

When a community is threatened by a thief, a neighbor who
has been robbed alerts others to take precautions. Something similar happens during viral infections. In 1957, it was
discovered that cells exposed to inactivated viruses produce
at least one soluble factor that can “interfere” with viral
replication when applied to newly infected cells. The term
interferon was coined to represent these molecules. Interferons are low-molecular-weight cytokines (14–20 kDa)
produced by many eukaryotic cells in response to intracellular infection. The action of interferons is usually species
specific (interferon from mice will not work on human cells)
but virus nonspecific (human interferon will help protect
against both poliovirus and influenza virus, for example).
There are two general types of interferons, which differ
in the receptors they bind and the responses they generate.
Type I interferons have high antiviral potency; they consist
of IFN-alpha (IFN-α), IFN-beta (IFN-β), and IFN-omega
(IFN-ω). Type II interferon, IFN-gamma (IFN-γ), has more
of an immunomodulatory function, discussed in Chapter 24.
Type I interferons can bind to specific receptors on
uninfected host cells and render those cells resistant to
viral infection. The host cell becomes resistant because
interferon induces the intracellular production of two
classes of proteins. One class encompasses double-stranded
RNA-activated endoribonucleases that can cleave viral
RNA. Proteins in the second class are protein kinases that
phosphorylate and inactivate eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2), which is required to translate viral RNA.
These mechanisms affect both RNA and DNA viruses
because protein synthesis is required for the propagation
of all viruses. However, RNA viruses are better than DNA
viruses at inducing interferon. Type I interferons are used
to treat certain viral infections (for example, hepatitis C).
Type II interferon functions by activating various white
blood cells—for example, macrophages, natural killer cells,
and T cells—to, among other things, increase the number
of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens on
their surfaces. MHC proteins are important for recognizing self and for presenting foreign antigens to the adaptive
immune system. They are discussed more fully in Chapter 24.

Acute Inflammation

In medicine, the term “acute” means “rapid onset.” Acute
inflammation, for instance, is inflammation that develops
rapidly, usually within a day, after a foreign object such as

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

selectins snag neutrophils zooming by in the bloodstream, slow them down, and cause them to roll
along the endothelium (Fig. 23.31). Rolling neutrophils that encounter inflammatory mediators are
activated to produce and display integrin adhesion
molecules on their surface. Integrins on neutrophils lock onto the endothelial adhesion molecules
ICAM-1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and
VCAM-1 (vascular cell adhesion molecule 1). Binding to these endothelial adhesion molecules stops
the neutrophils from rolling and initiates extravasation in which the white blood cells squeeze through
the endothelial wall and into the tissues.
The passage of neutrophils through vascular walls
also requires relaxation of adhesion between endothelial cells. Vasoactive factors such as bradykinin,
a nine-amino-acid polypeptide released by damaged
tissue cells and macrophages, increase vascular permeability so that neutrophils can pass through vessel
walls (Fig. 23.32). Increased vascular permeability
also allows blood plasma to escape into tissues, causing swelling (edema). Even though tight junctions

a splinter or infectious agent is introduced into the body. Chronic inflammation develops over long periods of
time. The function of acute inflammation is to wall off, kill, or digest the
intruder, thereby quickly resolving an
infection and promoting healing of the
affected area. Neutrophils play a central role in the inflammatory process.
Neutrophils, however, normally
reside in the circulation. How do they
find the infection site? Certain cytokines
synthesized after MAMPs bind to PRRs
are called chemokines (examples are
IL-8 and MCP-1). Chemokines diffuse
from a site of infection toward nearby
capillaries and form a concentration gradient. Then, like a fox following a prey’s
scent, neutrophils leave the bloodstream
and follow the gradient back to the
infection. But how do neutrophils pass
through blood vessel walls?
The events leading to extravasation
begin when the cytokines interleukin 1
(IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha
(TNF-alpha), released by macrophages,
stimulate the production of adhesion
molecules (selectins) on the inner lining of the capillaries. P-selectin is produced first, followed by E-selectin. The

are loosened, to actually pass between endothelial cells, activated neutrophils need the enzyme sialidase to temporarily
break carbohydrate linkages that hold tight junctions together.
Bradykinin also triggers degranulation of mast cells. The histamine released from mast cells further loosens the endothelial
cell junctions. More fluid enters tissues and accumulates.
In addition to increasing vascular permeability, bradykinin and histamine relax smooth muscles within blood
vessel walls so that vessel diameter increases (vasodilation).
Vasodilation slows blood flow and, as a result, increases
blood volume in the affected area. Increased vascular permeability and vasodilation cause the localized swelling,
redness, and heat associated with inflammation.

Once neutrophils have passed through the vascular wall,
chemokines lure them to the proper location. In addition,
neutrophils can sense certain microbial chemoattractants—
fMet-Leu-Phe peptide, for instance. Many bacterial proteins
have fMet (N-formylmethionine) as their N-terminal amino
acid, but mammalian proteins, in general, do not. Bacteria will often cleave off the fMet peptide, which can then
diffuse away from the bacterium. The fMet peptide binds
to neutrophil receptors and stimulates pseudopod projections aimed toward the microbe. As a result, the white
blood cell migrates in the direction of the infection. Once
phagocytes arrive at the site of infection, they begin devouring microbes. Realize, however, that much of the damage
caused by an infection is not due directly to the microbe but
is the result of the body’s reaction to its presence.

23.6 As illustrated in Figure 23.31, integrin is important for
neutrophil extravasation. Some individuals, however, produce
neutrophils that lack integrin. What is the likely consequence
of this genetic disorder?

What causes the pain of inflammation? Bradykinin
induces capillary cells to make prostaglandins that cause
pain by stimulating nerve endings in the area. A key
enzyme involved in prostaglandin synthesis is cyclooxygenase (COX). Aspirin, ibuprofen, and the anti-inflammatory
agent naproxen are COX inhibitors that prevent the synthesis of prostaglandins and thus reduce inflammatory pain.

the surface of another body cell, the phagocyte becomes
temporarily paralyzed (unable to form pseudopods). Paralysis allows the phagocyte to evaluate whether the other cell
is friend or foe, self or nonself. Self recognition involves
glycoproteins located on the white blood cell membrane
binding inhibitory glycoproteins present on all host cell
membranes. The inhibitory glycoprotein on human cells is
called CD47. Because invading bacteria lack these inhibitory surface molecules, they can readily be engulfed.
Although many bacteria, such as Mycobacterium or Listeria species, are easily recognized and engulfed by phagocytosis (Fig. 23.33A–C), others, such as Streptococcus
pneumoniae, possess polysaccharide capsules that are too
slippery for pseudopods to grab (Fig. 23.33D). This is
where innate immunity and adaptive immunity join forces.
Adaptive immunity produces anticapsular antibodies that
aid the innate immune mechanism of phagocytosis through
a process known as opsonization (Fig. 23.34). The anticapsular antibodies coat the surface of the bacterium, leaving the tail end of the antibodies, called the Fc region (see
Section 24.2), pointing outward. These bacteria are said
to be “opsonized.” The Fc regions of these antibodies are
recognized and bound by specific receptors on phagocyte
cell surfaces. As a result, the antibodies stick the opsonized
bacteria to phagocytic Fc receptors, which allow the phagocyte to more easily engulf the invader.

Thought Question

23.8 If NK cells can attack infected host cells coated with
antibody, why won’t neutrophils?

Oxygen-Independent and -Dependent
Killing Pathways

During phagocytosis, the cytoplasmic membrane of the
phagocyte flows around, and then engulfs, the bacterium,
producing an intracellular phagosome, as described earlier. Subsequent phagosome-lysosome fusion (producing
a phagolysosome; see Fig. 23.19) results in both oxygenindependent and oxygen-dependent killing pathways. Mechanisms independent of oxygen include enzymes like lysozyme
to destroy the cell wall, compounds such as lactoferrin to
sequester iron away from the microbe, and defensins, small
cationic antimicrobial peptides (described in Section 23.4).
Oxygen-dependent mechanisms are activated through Tolllike receptors (discussed later in this section) and kill through
the production of various oxygen radicals. NADPH oxidase,
myeloperoxidase, and nitric oxide synthetase in the phagosome membrane are extremely important. NADPH oxidase
yields superoxide ion (•O2–), hydrogen peroxide, and, ultimately, hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and hydroxide ions (OH–).

Myeloperoxidase, present only in neutrophils, converts hydrogen peroxide and chloride ions to hypochlorous acid (HOCl).
Macrophages, mast cells, and neutrophils also generate
reactive nitrogen intermediates that serve as potent cytotoxic
agents. Nitric oxide (NO) is synthesized from arginine by NO
synthetase. Further oxidation of NO by oxygen yields nitrite
(NO2–) and nitrate (NO3–) ions. All of these reactive oxygen

species attack bacterial membranes and proteins. These mechanisms greatly increase oxygen consumption during phagocytosis, called the oxidative burst. The reactive chemical
species formed during the oxidative burst do little to harm the
phagocyte because the burst is limited to the phagosome and
because the various reactive oxygen species, such as superoxide, are very short-lived. Although phagocytes are very good
at clearing infectious agents, many bacteria have developed
ways to outsmart this aspect of innate immunity.

clear themselves of intracellular pathogens. During autophagy, the cell constructs a double membrane around the
organism (or damaged organelle). This structure, called the
autophagosome, sequesters the microbe from the nutrientrich cytosol. Lysosomes then fuse with the autophagosome,
depositing degradative enzymes that digest the organism.
Ever-adapting intracellular microbes, however, have found
ways to suppress autophagy and survive.

Inflammation that persists over months or years is called
chronic inflammation and is provoked by the long-term
presence of a causative stimulus. Chronic inflammation
inevitably causes permanent tissue damage, even though the
body attempts repair. The causes of chronic inflammation
are many. For example, infectious organisms such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Actinomyces bovis, and various protozoan parasites can avoid or resist host defenses (Fig. 23.35).

Intracellular pathogens that grow in eukaryotic cytoplasm
can be a serious problem for the host. Many pathogens,
such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause of tuberculosis, enter the host cell in ways that bypass endosome formation or, if they do enter via an endosome, can escape from
that compartment. These pathogens block normal host cell
clearance pathways. To circumvent this problem, eukaryotic host cells (not just phagocytes) use a process that normally degrades damaged organelles (called autophagy) to

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

As a result, they persist at the site and continually stimulate the basic inflammatory response. The continual
stimulation of an inflammatory response leads to chronic
inflammation.
Nonliving, irritant material like wood splinters, inhaled
asbestos particles, or surgical implants can also cause
chronic inflammation. Autoimmune diseases are another
important cause. Autoimmunity (reaction against self)
occurs when there is a failure to regulate some aspect
of adaptive immunity (see Chapter 24). As a result, the
immune system recognizes a part of the body as foreign
(not self) and begins to react against it. Rheumatoid arthritis is one example of the body attacking itself.
Whatever causes chronic inflammation, macrophages
and lymphocytes are continually recruited from the circulation. The body may attempt to “wall off” the site of
inflammation by forming a granuloma. A granuloma
begins as an aggregation of the mononuclear inflammatory
cells surrounded by a rim of lymphocytes. The body then
deposits fibroconnective tissue around the lesion, causing
tissue hardening known as fibrosis.
Several forms of granulomas are shown in Figure 23.35.
M. tuberculosis, for example, has a thick, waxy cell wall that
protects mycobacteria against the mechanisms used by
macrophages to destroy microorganisms. As a result, the
organisms live for prolonged periods within macrophages
(Fig. 23.35A). Resistance to host defenses can produce
long-term chronic infections and granulomas. For example, skin infections caused by Mycobacterium marinum will
produce skin granulomas (Fig. 23.35B), while M. tuberculosis can cause liver granulomas (Fig. 23.35C). Another
disease thought to involve granuloma formation is Crohn’s
disease, which commonly manifests as abdominal pain,
frequent bowel movements, and rectal bleeding. Crohn’s
disease has been attributed to an autoimmune reaction possibly activated by intestinal microbiota. In this case, the
intestinal bacteria are thought to cause a chronic inflammation resulting in characteristic granulomas (compare
Fig. 23.35D and E).

To Summarize
■

Acute inflammation begins when host cells are damaged or infected. The process walls off and digests invading microbes, and initiates the healing of affected areas.
Damaged cells or tissue macrophages release vasoactive
factors that produce vasodilation and increased vascular permeability, cytokines that stimulate the production
of blood vessel selectin receptors, and chemoattractant
molecules that cause neutrophil movement (extravasation) from the bloodstream into infected tissues.
Bradykinin causes the release of prostaglandins, which

produce pain in the affected area. The cardinal signs of
inflammation include redness, warmth, swelling, pain,
and loss of function.

Surface Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytoplasmic
NOD-like receptors (NLRs) in most host cells recognize microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs)
and synthesize cytokine proteins that diffuse and activate other cells of the immune system.
Interferons are one group of cytokines that can nonspecifically interfere with viral replication (type I) or
modulate the immune system (type II).
Phagocytic cells have oxygen-independent and
oxygen-dependent mechanisms of killing initiated
by the fusion of lysosomes and bacteria-containing
phagosomes.
The oxidative burst, a large increase in oxygen consumption during phagocytosis, results in the production
of superoxide ions, nitric oxide, and other reactive oxygen species.
Autophagy is a process by which intracellular bacteria can be sequestered from the cytoplasm (via an
autophagosome) and killed following fusion with a
lysosome.
Chronic inflammation results from the persistent presence of a foreign object.

23.6

Complement and Fever

White blood cells (WBCs) engulf and kill pathogens, but
can simple serum proteins also kill microbes? Yes, a series
of 20 serum proteins (complement factors) that make up
the complement cascade can also attack bacterial invaders.
Complement was first discovered as a heat-labile component of blood that enhances (or complements) the killing
effect of antibodies on bacteria. Several complement factors
are proteases that sequentially form and cleave other complement factors. (The liver is the main source of complement proteins.) Once a complement cascade is triggered,
several things happen. Pores are inserted into bacterial
membranes, causing cytoplasmic leaks, while pieces of some
complement proteins attract WBCs and facilitate phagocytosis (opsonization).

Complement Activation Pathways

The three routes to complement activation are officially
known as the classical pathway, the alternative pathway,
and the lectin pathway. The classical complement pathway

CHAPTER 23

depends on antibody, so it is part of adaptive rather than
innate immunity and is discussed in the next chapter
(Section 24.4). The lectin pathway requires the synthesis of mannose-binding lectin by the liver in response to
macrophage cytokines. Lectin coats the surface of invading microbes and activates complement without antibody.
The lectin pathway connects to the classical complement
pathway. We focus here in Chapter 23 on the alternative
pathway because it is a well-characterized part of innate
resistance. Like the lectin pathway, the alternative pathway
is a nonspecific defense mechanism that does not require
antibody for activation. The alternative complement pathway can attack invading microbes long before a specific
immune response can be launched.
One goal of the complement cascade is to insert pores
into target microbial membranes. The pores destroy membrane integrity, and thus kill the cell. The alternative
complement pathway begins with the complement factor C3. In blood, C3 slowly cleaves into C3a and C3b
(Fig. 23.36, step 1). C3b, under normal circumstances,

and C3b.

is rapidly degraded—a process that thwarts inadvertent
complement activation. However, if C3b meets LPS on
an invading Gram-negative microbe, the bound C3b
becomes stable and binds another factor, designated factor B (step 2), and makes factor B susceptible to cleavage
by yet another protein, factor D (step 3). The resulting
complex, called C3bBb, has two roles. It is a C3 convertase that can quickly cleave more C3 to amplify the cascade and is changed by another serum protein (properdin)
into what is called C5 convertase (step 4). From this point
on, all complement pathways are identical. C5 convertase cleaves C5 in serum to C5a and C5b (step 5), and
C5b then forms a prepore complex by binding to C6 and
C7 (step 6). The resulting C5bC6C7 complex binds to
membranes. Finally, C8 and C9 factors join in to form the
membrane attack complex (MAC), becoming a destructive pore (step 7).
In Gram-negative bacteria, MAC pores first form
in the outer membrane (Fig. 23.36, step 7). Lysozyme (present in serum) enters through the MAC outer

membrane pores and cleaves peptidoglycan, making the
cell membrane more susceptible to the membrane attack
complex. The inner membrane MAC pores destroy membrane integrity and, with it, proton motive force. Grampositive bacteria are resistant to complement because
they lack an outer membrane (and therefore have no LPS
to efficiently start the cascade) and have a thick peptidoglycan layer that hinders access of complement components. Even in the absence of LPS, however, there
are ways to activate complement that involve antigenantibody complexes (see Section 24.4). Eukaryotic cells
infected with viruses and coated with antibody can also
activate complement via the antibody-dependent classical
complement pathway.

Thought Question

23.9 Figure 23.36 shows how the complement cascade can

destroy a bacterial cell. Factor H (not shown) is a blood protein
that regulates complement activity. Factor H binds host cells
and inhibits complement from attacking our cells by accelerating degradation of C3b and C3bBb. How could bacteria take
advantage of factor H?

Other Roles for Complement
Peptides in Innate Immunity

Factor C3b, in addition to initiating the complement cascade, is a potent opsonin. An opsonin is any factor that can
promote phagocytosis (related to opsonization, described
earlier). PMNs (neutrophils) have specific C3b receptors on
their surface. Thus, when C3b binds to a bacterial cell surface, it tags that cell and makes it easier for PMNs to grab
and engulf the organism.
The complement fragments C5a (which forms part
of the prepore complex) and C3a have many roles in
immune function. They are anaphylatoxins, which trigger degranulation of vasoactive factors such as histamine
from endothelial cells, mast cells, or phagocytes. They can
also stimulate chemotaxis of immune cells. C5a and C3a
bind to separate receptors on WBC plasma membranes
and activate separate signal cascade pathways. C5a triggers Ca 2+ release from intracellular stores and stimulates
the actin polymerization needed for cell migration. Conversely, C3a triggers Ca 2+ influx, which facilitates extravasation. These peptide mediators also stimulate the release
of certain cytokines, such as IL-4 from monocytes and
mast cells, that prepare capillary endothelium for the rolling and adhesion of neutrophils. C5a will also up-regulate
P-selectin and ICAM-1. Thus, some complement factors not only help directly destroy target bacterial cells,
but also facilitate phagocytosis and contribute directly to
inflammation.

Acute-Phase Reactants,
Complement, and Heart Disease

As noted earlier, inflammation is associated with the
production of various cytokines by macrophages. Some
of these cytokines (such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-6)
travel to the liver, where they stimulate synthesis of several
so-called acute-phase reactant proteins, including C-reactive protein. Named for its ability to activate complement, C-reactive protein is an acute-phase reactant that
will bind to components of bacterial cell surfaces but not
to host cell membranes (Fig. 23.37). Once tied to the
bacterial cell surface, C-reactive protein will bind complement factor C1q of the classical complement pathway
(see Chapter 24), ultimately converting factor C3 to C3b,
propagating the complement cascade. C-reactive protein
accelerates C3b production at the bacterial surface, where
it can do the most damage. Note that an elevated level of
C-reactive protein in serum is considered a general indicator of inflammation, not just inflammation caused by
infection.

Fever

What is fever, and why is it a good thing? To understand
fever, we first need to know how the body controls its temperature (themoregulation). Heat in a human body is produced as a consequence of metabolic reactions. The liver

CHAPTER 23

and muscles are the major generators of heat and will warm
the blood that passes through them. In a healthy person,
body temperature is kept between 36°C and 38°C (97°F
and 100°F), despite large differences in surrounding temperature and physical activity. Fever is defined as an oral
temperature above 100.4°F.
How do we normally maintain a body temperature
of 37°C? Heat sensors located throughout the skin and
large organs and along the spinal cord send information
about the body’s temperature to the thermoregulatory
center in the hypothalamus, a small organ located in the
brain near the brain stem. The hypothalamus acts as a
thermostat by controlling blood flow through the skin
and subcutaneous areas. Vasoconstriction (tightening of
blood vessel diameter) prevents the release of body heat
when we are cold, whereas vasodilation secures its quick
release when we are hot. If skin temperature is too high,
the hypothalamus directs vasodilation to accelerate heat
release. If body temperature is too low, blood flow will
decrease to conserve heat, and shivering begins as a way
to generate more heat.
Fever is a natural reaction to infection and is usually
accompanied by general symptoms such as sweating, chills,
and the sensation of being cold. Substances that cause fever
are known as pyrogens. Exogenous pyrogens (for example,
certain bacterial toxins) originate outside the body, whereas
internal or endogenous pyrogens (such as tumor necrosis
factor and the interferon IL-6) are made by the body itself.
External pyrogens generally cause fever by inducing the
release of internal cytokine pyrogens.
Pyrogenic cytokines cross the blood-brain barrier and
bind to neurons in the thermoregulatory center of the anterior hypothalamus. Cytokine-receptor interaction stimulates the production of phospholipase A2, an enzyme
required to make prostaglandins. Prostaglandin E2 is made
and changes the responsiveness of thermosensitive neurons.
In other words, prostaglandin E2 turns up the thermostat.
The body “thinks” it is cold, so the hypothalamus sends
signals via the autonomic nervous system (which acts below
the level of consciousness) to constrict peripheral blood
vessels (vasoconstriction). Heat is not released and builds
up to cause fever. Involuntary muscle contractions (shivering and chills) also generate heat.
What are the advantages of fever? Because the ideal
growth temperature for many microbes is 37°C, elevated
temperature can place the pathogenic organism outside its
“comfort zone” of growth. There is also evidence that fever
reduces iron availability to bacteria (cytokine release causes
an increase in iron storage protein). Slower growth of the
pathogen “buys” the immune system time to subdue the
infection before it is too late. Consequently, interventions
that reduce a moderate fever caused by infection may actually slow recovery.

Complement is a series of 20 proteins naturally present
in serum.
Activation of the complement cascade results in a pore
being introduced into target membranes.
The three pathways for activation are the classical,
alternative, and lectin pathways.
The alternative activation pathway begins when complement factor C3b is stabilized by interaction with the
LPS of an invading microbe.
The cascade of protein factors, C3b ⎯→ factor B ⎯→
factor D ⎯→ properdin ⎯→ C5 ⎯→ C6 ⎯→ C7 ⎯→
C8 and C9, results in the formation of a membrane
attack complex in target membranes.
C-reactive protein in serum is activated when bound to
microbial structures and will convert C3 to C3b, which
can start the complement cascade.
The hypothalamus acts as the body’s thermostat.
Exogenous and endogenous pyrogens elevate body
temperature by stimulating prostaglandin production.
Prostaglandins change the responsiveness of thermosensitive neurons in the hypothalamus.

Concluding Thoughts
The human body plays host to numerous species of
microbes (our microbiota), many of which contribute to
our health and well-being. The various “hardwired” innate
immune mechanisms described here in Chapter 23 keep
our microbiota at bay and provide an effective first line
of defense against potential pathogens. The next chapter
addresses what happens when microbes breach these innate
defenses. Unlike the general protective mechanisms just
discussed, the system of adaptive immunity generates a
molecular defense specifically tailored to a given pathogen.
Keep in mind that innate and adaptive immune systems
“talk” to each other and collaborate to present the most
effective response to a given pathogen, whether bacterial,
viral, or parasitic.

nce an infecting pathogen eludes our innate

daunting foe: an adaptive immune system
that stirs only when challenged. Adaptive immunity is
composed of special lymphocytes called B cells and
T cells that multiply during an infection and “remember” the specific invader for years. These specially
trained lymphocytes are poised to respond quickly
to a second infection by the pathogen. Left unregulated, however, adaptive immunity can turn on us,
producing autoimmune disease.

24.1 Overview of Adaptive Immunity

Why are chemokines and B-cell ICOSL
needed for T-cell migration into the
B-cell zone?

Available data indicate that a factor made
in the follicle antagonizes chemokinedependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
(PI3K) activation signals in T cells needed
for optimal cytoskeleton reorganization
and motility. Consequently, PI3K activated only by the folliclehoming chemokine CXCL13 is insufficient for T-cell movement
into the B-cell zone. This is why ICOSL-mediated activation of
ICOS, which strongly activates the PI3K pathway, becomes
necessary for T-cell migration at the T-B border.
The B-cell ICOSL–/– chimeric mice you constructed failed
to move T cells into the B-cell zone. Were these mice able
to make antibody?
These mice do not efficiently make antibody to T-dependent
antigens. However, they are still able to respond to
T-independent antigens.
Do you foresee a potential clinical application for your
findings?
Yes. ICOSL can be massively induced in inflamed tissues
where effector T cells are recruited. This is beneficial to
fighting infections but detrimental to tissue homeostasis.
Understanding how bystander B-cell ICOS activation regulates T-cell migration may provide new ways to therapeutically augment or reduce inflammatory infiltration.

THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE

■

immune system does not recognize the whole microbe,
but innumerable tiny pieces of it. Each small segment of an
antigen that is capable of eliciting an immune response is
called an antigenic determinant or epitope. Many singleprotein antigens are recognized when the larger antigen is
broken into smaller segments upon being phagocytosed.
Even distinct tertiary (3D) shapes within a protein may
be counted as antigenic determinants if they produce a
specific response. Immune responses to 3D shapes are
possible when stretches of amino acids far removed from
each other in a protein’s primary sequence align side by side
in 3D space after folding (Fig. 24.2). Such a 3D structure
may be recognized by the immune system as a single entity
or antigen. Besides proteins, other structures in the cell,
such as complex polysaccharides, can have linear and 3D
epitopes. So the immune response to a microbe is really
a composite of thousands of B-cell responses to different
epitopes. The response to each individual epitope is clonal;
that is, it gives rise to a population of cells that originate
from a single B cell. This means that each clone of B cells
will target a unique epitope.
The humoral immune response requires several
cell types and cell-to-cell interactions. What are those
interactions, and where do they take place? As illustrated
in Figure 24.3, the process begins with an infection
somewhere in the body. Dendritic cells and macrophages
patrolling the area gather up the foreign antigens and
present them on their cell surface. Any phagocytic cell that
degrades large antigens into smaller antigenic determinants
and places those determinants on their cell surface is called
an antigen-presenting cell (APC). Many types of cells can
be antigen-presenting. They include “professional” APCs,
such as macrophages (monocytes), mast cells, or dendritic

Note:

The terms “adaptive immune response” and “immune
response” are often used interchangeably.

Antibody-Dependent versus
Cell-Mediated Immunity

Two types of adaptive immunity are recognized: humoral
immunity and cell-mediated immunity. In humoral
immunity, antibodies are produced that directly target
microbial invaders. The term “humoral” means “related
to body fluids.” Thus, antibodies are proteins that circulate in the bloodstream and recognize foreign structures
called antigens. An antigen (also called an immunogen)
is any molecule that, when introduced into a person, will
elicit the synthesis of antibodies that specifically bind the
antigen. Antigens stimulate B cells (B lymphocytes) to differentiate into antibody-producing cells. Cell-mediated
immunity, the second type of adaptive immunity, employs
teams of T cells (T lymphocytes) that recognize antigens
and then destroy host cells infected by the microbe possessing the antigen. The humoral and cellular immune
responses are intertwined, each relying on some facet of
the other to work efficiently. T cells serve a central role
in adaptive immunity by determining whether humoral or
cell-mediated mechanisms predominate in response to a
specific antigen.
What triggers an immune response, and how long
does it take? Adaptive immunity develops over a 3- to
4-day period after exposure to an invading microbe. The

2011 (Fig. 24.3B).

exposure and stand ready to quickly generate plasma cells,

Once formed, the memory B cells and most plasma cells
leave the lymph node and migrate to the bone marrow.
Other plasma cells remain in the lymph node. In the bone
marrow, memory B cells patiently wait to be called to
future sites of infection.
The cell-mediated immune response shares some aspects
of the humoral immune response. A type of T cells, called
cytotoxic T cells, also bind to microbial antigens presented
on an APC and become activated. Activated cytotoxic

CHAPTER 24

T cells seek out and directly kill any host cell infected with
the microbe. In addition to directly killing infected cells,
cytotoxic T cells synthesize and secrete growth factors,
called cytokines (see Sections 23.2 and 23.5), that incite
nearby macrophages to indiscriminately attack cells in the
local area. Thus, cellular immunity, in general, is critical
for dealing with intracellular pathogens such as viruses,
whereas humoral immunity is most effective against
extracellular bacterial pathogens like Streptococcus pyogenes,
one cause of wound infections and sore throat.
As we proceed through this chapter, we will reveal
in layers how the immune system functions, with each
layer building on the previous one. We will periodically
return to a particular aspect of the immune response—
for example, B-cell differentiation into plasma cells—to
integrate seemingly distinct parts of the immune system
into a unified concept of immunity.
Thought Question

24.1 Two different stretches of amino acids in a single

protein form a 3D antigenic determinant. Will the specific
immune response to that 3D antigen also respond to one of
the two amino acid stretches alone?

Immunogenicity

Immunogenicity measures the effectiveness by which
an antigen elicits an immune response. One antigen can
be more immunogenic than another. For example, proteins are the strongest antigens, but carbohydrates can
also elicit immune reactions. Nucleic acids and lipids are
usually weaker antigens, in part because these molecules
are both made of relatively uniform repeating units that
are very f lexible. The f lexible units present a variable 3D
structure that does not easily interact with antibodies.
Proteins are more effective antigens for three reasons:
Different proteins have different shapes, they maintain
their tertiary structure, and they are made of many different amino acids that can be assembled in many different combinations. These features provide stronger
interactions with antibodies in the bloodstream and
enable better recognition by lymphocytes, the cellular
workhorses of the immune system.
Several other factors contribute to the immunogenicity of
proteins (see eTopic 24.1). For example, the larger the antigen,
the more likely it is that phagocytic cells will “see” and engulf
it. This is important because, as noted earlier, an immune
response cannot occur until phagocytic antigen-presenting
cells (such as macrophages and dendritic cells) first engulf
large antigens and degrade them, presenting the epitopes on
their cell surface. The immune response begins when a B cell
binds to a foreign peptide and a T lymphocyte binds to the

■

THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE

■

same foreign peptide displayed on the surface of an antigenpresenting cell. The B cell–APC and T cell–APC binding
events are independent of each other.
The presentation of antigens on APCs forces the antigen
to be placed on a membrane surface protein structure
called the major histocompatibility complex, or MHC
(discussed later). The more tightly an antigen can bind to
these MHC surface proteins, the more immunogenic it
is. The stronger the binding, the easier it is for T cells to
recognize the complex.
Each specific antigen shows a different threshold dose
needed to generate an optimal response. A dose higher or
lower than that threshold will generate a weaker immune
response. Lower doses activate only a few B cells, whereas
exceedingly high doses of antigen can cause B-cell
tolerance, a state in which B cells have been overstimulated
to the point that they do not respond to subsequent
antigen exposures and make antibody. Tolerance is part of
the reason your immune system does not react against your
own protein antigens.
As you might expect, the body must regulate the immune
system carefully so that a response is not leveled against
itself. In effect, the immune system must become “blind”
to its own antigens; as a result, the host will often be blind
to foreign antigens that resemble epitopes of its own cells.
Therefore, the more complex the foreign protein is, the
more likely it will possess antigenic determinants that a
lymphocyte can recognize as nonself. The farther an antigen
is from “self,” the greater its immunogenicity will be.

Immunological Specificity

Our earliest clues into the nature of immunity came from
smallpox. Smallpox is a devastating disease that caused
enormous suffering and killed millions of people in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries (see Chapter 1 and
Fig. 24.4). There was no cure, and the only available preventive treatment was to take dried material from the lesions
of a previous smallpox sufferer, place it on a healthy person,
and hope the person survived. Those who survived were
protected from subsequent bouts of smallpox but were still
susceptible to other diseases. This early observation gave
rise to the idea of immunological specificity, which means
that an immune response to one antigen is not effective
against a different antigen. In other words, the immune
response to smallpox will not protect someone against the
plague bacillus (Yersinia pestis), which is antigenically different from the smallpox virus.
While immunological specificity is important, it is not
absolute. As described in Chapter 1, an English country
physician named Edward Jenner (see Fig. 1.18B) in the late
eighteenth century (long before viruses were discovered)
learned to protect townsfolk from deadly smallpox disease

(live, attenuated) strains of the pathogenic
microbe or inactivated microbial toxins (for
example, diphtheria toxin).
Cross-protection, in which immunization against one microbe protects against
a second, will work only if two proteins
critical to the pathogenesis of the two different microorganisms share key antigenic
determinants. Cross-protection will not
take place if these determinants differ significantly. A good example is the common cold, which is caused by hundreds of
closely related rhinovirus strains (rhinitis, a
runny nose, is one of the symptoms of this
viral disease). Infection with one strain will
not immunize the victim against a second
strain. The reason is that the structures
of rhinovirus proteins that attach to the
ICAM-1 surface protein on host cells differ dramatically between different strains of
rhinovirus (Fig. 24.5A). Antibodies called
neutralizing antibodies, which bind to the attachment protein on one strain of rhinovirus, will prevent infection by
that strain (Fig. 24.5B) but will not bind an antigenically
distinct ICAM-1 receptor protein from a different strain. A
key to one lock will not work in a different lock.

Antigens and
Immunogens

Antigens that, by themselves, can
elicit antibody production are
called immunogens. Molecules of
molecular weight less than 1,000,
however, are generally not immunogenic, because they do not bind
MHC molecules. Nevertheless,
these small molecules, called haptens (from the Greek word meaning “to fasten” and the German
word for “stuff”), will elicit the
production of specific antibodies if they are covalently attached
to a larger carrier protein or other
molecule (Fig. 24.6). Haptens can
be thought of as small, incomplete
antigens. An example of a hapten is

the hapten-BSA complex is injected, the mouse produces
not only antibodies that react to the carrier (BSA), but also
other antibodies that react against the benzene hapten. The
reason for this carrier effect will become evident later in
the chapter, when we describe how antigens are processed
by cells of the immune system. Thus, antigens include

immunogens that elicit an immune response by themselves,
and haptens that must be attached to an immunogen in
order to generate an immune response. Karl Landsteiner
uncovered the antigen-immunogen-hapten relationship in
the early 1900s, along with discovering the ABO blood
group system that first defined the concept of immunological specificity (eTopic 24.2).

An antigen can elicit an antibody response. An antigen
usually consists of many different epitopes (antigenic
determinants), each of which binds to a different, specific antibody.
Humoral immunity against infection is the result
of antibody production originated by B cells. A subgroup of T cell lymphocytes stimulate B cells to become
antibody-secreting plasma cells.
Cell-mediated (cellular) immunity involves another
subgroup of T cells called cytoxic T cells that can directly
kill host cells.
Proteins are better immunogens than nucleic acids and
lipids because proteins have more diverse chemical forms.
Antigen-presenting cells (APCs), such as phagocytes,
degrade microbial pathogens and present distinct pieces
on their cell-surface MHC proteins.

Antibody Structure,
Diversity, and Synthesis

What are antibodies, and why are they important? Antibodies, also called immunoglobulins, are members of the larger
immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins. Made by the body
in response to an antigen, antibodies are the keys to immunological specificity. Members of the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins have in common a 110-amino-acid domain
with an internal disulfide bond. The immunoglobulin superfamily includes antibodies and other important binding proteins, such as the major histocompatibility proteins and parts
of the B-cell receptor described later.

Note:

Antibodies are called immunoglobulins and belong to
the immunoglobulin superfamily of proteins. However, this superfamily includes many other cell-surface-binding proteins, such as
the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins and various
cytokine receptor proteins. These latter proteins are not antibodies and are not called immunoglobulins. The term “immunoglobulins” is reserved for antibodies.

Like miniature “smart bombs,” antibody immunoglobulins
individually circulate through blood, ignoring all antigens
except those for which they were designed. When an antibody
finds its antigenic match, it binds to the antigen and initiates
several events designed to destroy the target. Antibodies, in
addition to being free-floating, are strategically situated on
the surface of B cells, where they enable the B lymphocytes to
recognize specific antigens (B-cell receptors are discussed later
in this section).
A typical antibody consists of four polypeptide chains.
There are two large heavy chains and two smaller light
chains (Fig. 24.7). The four polypeptides combine to form
a Y-shaped tetrameric structure held together by disulfide
bonds. Two bonds connect the two identical heavy chains
to each other. One light chain is then attached near its
carboxyl end to the middle of each heavy chain by a single
disulfide bond. The antigen-binding sites are formed at the
amino-terminal ends of the light and heavy chains. One
antibody molecule possesses two identical antigen-binding
sites, one on each “arm” of the molecule.

Antibody Structure Enables
Immunoprecipitation

A typical antibody molecule has two antigen-binding sites,
each of which binds identical antigens. Because a single
antibody can bind two identical epitopes, antibodies can
cross-link antigens in solution, ultimately forming complexes that are too large to remain soluble, so they fall out
of solution (Fig. 24.8). The phenomenon, called immunoprecipitation, is normally observed only in vitro, where
the concentrations of antigen and antibody can be manipulated experimentally.
Immunoprecipitation occurs only with appropriate
ratios of antigen and antibody molecules. Too many
antigen molecules (antigen excess; Fig. 24.8A) or too few

antigen molecules (antibody excess; Fig. 24.8B) result in
complexes too small to immunoprecipitate. Large complexes
are formed only at an appropriate antigen/antibody ratio,
called equivalence (Fig. 24.8C). Equivalence is the point
where the number of antigenic sites is roughly equal to the
number of antigen-binding sites.
Immunoprecipitation is the basis for many experimental
immunological techniques. For example, the concentration
of an antigen can be determined in vitro, or antibodies
can be used to identify and remove specific antigens
from a complex mixture because the specific antigenantibody complex precipitates. eAppendix 3 describes some
experimental uses for immunoprecipitation, such as radial
immunodiffusion and western blotting.

Antibodies Have Constant
and Variable Regions

amino-terminal ends of the light and heavy chains. These
variable regions are referred to as the V L and V H regions,
respectively (Fig. 24.9). The rest of each immunoglobulin chain is composed of the highly conserved constant
regions. CH1, CH 2, and CH3 denote the three different
constant regions in each heavy chain. Shortly, we will discuss the genes that code for these regions and the combinatorial possibilities underlying the formation of different
antibody molecules.
In addition to the two “arms” that bind antigens, every
antibody contains a “tail” called the Fc region (Fig. 24.9).
The Fc region is not involved in antigen recognition but is
important for anchoring antibodies to the surface of certain
host cells and for binding components of the complement
system.

There are five classes of antibodies, defined by five different types of heavy chains, called alpha (α), mu (μ), gamma
(γ), delta (δ), and epsilon (ε). The heavy-chain classes are
distinguished one from another by regions of highly conserved amino acid sequences, known as constant regions
(denoted CH for the heavy chain) (Fig. 24.9). Antibodies
containing gamma heavy chains are called IgG; those with
alpha, mu, delta, and epsilon heavy chains are called IgA,
IgM, IgD, and IgE, respectively. Each antibody class serves
a specific purpose in the immune system.
In contrast to heavy chains, there are only two classes of
light chains—kappa (κ) and lambda (λ)—which are defined
by their own constant regions (CL). A single antibody of
any heavy-chain class (for example, IgG) may contain two
kappa light chains or two lambda light chains, but never
one of each. Two-thirds of all antibody molecules carry
kappa chains; the rest have lambda chains.
The antigen-binding part of an antibody is formed
by highly variable amino acid sequences situated at the

indicate different amino acid sequences (or epitopes) within an individual (Sherrie) or between individuals (Sherrie and John).

Understanding how an antibody’s isotype, allotype, and idiotype differ is important because
these terms reflect how antibodies carry out different functions in a host and bind different antigens.
“Isotype” refers to the amino acid differences in the
constant regions of heavy-chain classes (what makes IgG
different from IgE). These differences will be the same
in all members of a species (for example, Homo sapiens).
“Allotype” refers to any amino acid sequence differences
in the constant regions of either heavy or light chains that
make IgG from one person different from IgG in another
person. “Idiotype” refers to amino acid sequence differences between two molecules of the same isotype (IgG,
for example) in a single person. Idiotype differences usually
occur in the antigen-binding region of an antibody.
In real terms, consider two different people, John and
Sherrie. Blood of both John and Sherrie carries the human
IgG isotype. However, all of the IgG molecules circulating
in John have small, allotypic amino acid differences from
the IgG antibodies circulating in Sherrie (John and Sherrie
have different IgG allotypes) (Fig. 24.10). Within Sherrie
herself, the antigen-binding site of an IgG molecule that
binds a herpes virus epitope possesses idiotypic amino acid
differences from an IgG molecule in her that binds to a rhinovirus epitope. The synthesis and functional purpose of

these different levels of antibody diversity will be described
in the next several sections.
Note that antibodies are proteins too, and are themselves
antigens. Thus, the amino acid differences found within a
single class of antibody—IgG, for example—also represent
different antigenic epitopes within that class. Isotypic, allotypic, and idiotypic epitopes in antibody molecules can be
detected using the immunological techniques described in
eAppendix 3.

Antibody Isotype Functions
and “Super” Structures

All antibody isotypes have the same basic structure. However, each isotype has a unique superstructure (for example,
monomer or dimer), and each is designed to carry out a different task. Some key properties of the five different immunoglobulin classes are listed in Table 24.2.

IgG. The simplest and most abundant antibody in blood and

tissue fluids is IgG (its superstructure is shown in Fig. 24.9).
It is made as a monomer but has four subclasses. Each subclass varies in its amino acid composition and number of
interchain cross-links. IgG molecules carry out several missions for the immune system. First, they bind and opsonize
microbes; that is, they make microbes more susceptible to
phagocytes. Opsonizing IgG antibodies use their antigenbinding sites to stick to microbes, thereby causing their Fc
regions to protrude outward. Phagocytes possess surface Fc

B. IgA

IgM. Circulating IgM is a huge, Ferris wheel–shaped molecule formed from
five monomeric immunoglobulins tethered
together by the J-chain protein (Fig. 24.11A).
It can also be found in monomeric form on the
surface of B cells, where it forms part of the B-cell
receptor. IgM is the first antibody isotype detected
during the early stages of an immune response.

IgA. IgA is secreted across mucosal surfaces (linings
of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, and reproductive tracts) and is most commonly found as a dimer
(Fig. 24.11B). This explains why IgA can bind four molecules of antigen (each monomer can bind two). The components of the IgA dimer are linked by disulfide bonds to
a protein called the J chain, which joins two IgAs by their
Fc regions. A sixth protein, the secretory piece, is wrapped
around the IgA dimer during the secretion process. The
secreted molecule, now called sIgA (secretory IgA), is
found in tears, breast milk, and saliva, and on other mucosal surfaces. The molecule sIgA is important for mucosal
immunity against pathogens that infect mucosal linings.
IgD. The last two antibody isotypes, IgD and IgE, are pres-

ent at very low levels in the blood. IgD is a monomer that
can neither bind complement nor cross the placenta. IgD
molecules, however, are abundant on the surface of B cells.
Attached to B-cell surfaces by Fc regions, IgD, along with
monomeric IgM, can bind antigen and signal B cells to differentiate and make antibody.

IgE. IgE, also present in only trace amounts in the blood,

is found more prominently bound to the surfaces of mast
cells and basophils, where it has potent biological activity. Mast cells and basophils contain granules loaded with
inflammatory mediators. The primary role of IgE is to

amplify the body’s response to invaders. Once secreted into
serum, IgE attaches to mast cells (Fig. 24.12A and B),
again by way of its Fc region, and, like a Venus flytrap, waits
until its matched antigen binds to its antigen-binding site.
When two surface IgE molecules on a mast cell are crosslinked by antigen, a signal is sent internally that triggers
degranulation (see Section 24.7). The subsequent release
of histamine and other pharmacological mediators from
these granules helps orchestrate the acute inflammation that
takes place during early host responses to microbial infection (that is, while the antibody response is gearing up). The
system also causes severe allergic hypersensitivities (such as
anaphylaxis) and milder forms like hay fever (Fig. 24.12C).

differentiate into plasma cells and secrete antibody. Plasma
cells are much larger than B cells because of an enormous
increase in protein synthesis and secretion machinery.
The net result of the primary antibody response is the
early synthesis and secretion of pentameric IgM molecules
specifically directed against the antigen (also called the
immunogen). Later during the primary response, a process
known as isotype switching (class switching) occurs, and
the predominant antibody type produced becomes IgG
rather than IgM (discussed shortly). Antibodies made during
the primary response, while specific for the immunogen, are
actually not of the highest affinity. Later responses by memory
B cells increase antibody affinity (see the next section).

Primary and Secondary
Antibody Responses

Primary
response
Serum titer of antibodies

Once you have been infected with a microorganism or
have been given a vaccine, what happens? After a lag
period of several days, antibodies begin to appear in
the serum (the fluid that remains after blood clots).
During the lag period, a series of molecular and cellular events causes a distinct subset of B cells (located in
lymph nodes and spleen) to proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting plasma cells and memory
B cells. Each B cell is genetically programmed to make
antibodies to one antigen or epitope—a process called
the primary antibody response.
A subsequent exposure to the antigen, which can
take place months or years after the initial encounter,
will trigger a rapid, almost instantaneous increase in the
production of antibodies and is called the secondary
antibody response (Fig. 24.13). This quick response
occurs thanks to the memory B cells formed during the
primary response. Once stimulated, memory B cells rapidly

with the immunogen and the host.

PART 5

■

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

As the immunogen is cleared from the body, the levels
of both IgG and IgM decline because the plasma cells that
produced them die. Plasma cells have an average life span of
only 100 days. However, the immune system has been primed
to respond more aggressively to the immunogen, should it
encounter it again. A rapid response to a second encounter
is possible because memory B cells produced during the
primary response are maintained in lymph nodes or bone
marrow and continue to divide. If a person later encounters
the same antigen, these memory B cells quickly proliferate and
differentiate into plasma cells with no lag phase. Thus, memory
B cells rapidly initiate the secondary antibody response (or
anamnestic response, from the Greek anamnesis, meaning
“remembrance”). Memory B cells comprise approximately
40% of the B-cell population.
During the secondary response, memory B cells that
have undergone isotype switching from IgM to IgG
become plasma cells that secrete copious amounts of IgG
antibody. These antibodies have a higher specificity for the
antigen than do the antibodies produced during the primary response (see “Making Memory B Cells” at the end
of this section). The higher specificity—a result of hypermutation—causes some plasma cells to produce antibodies
that bind their antigens more strongly than those produced

by the clonal ancestor. Small amounts of IgM are also produced from the few memory cells that did not undergo isotype switching during the primary response.
The secondary antibody response is why vaccinations
work. Before vaccinations, the only way to be protected from
an infection by a given pathogen was to have already been
infected by that pathogen. Memory cells made during the
primary response will protect you against a second infection,
but pathogens can do considerable harm during the lag phase
of the primary response. To avoid this harm, an innocuous
version of a pathogen, or a harmless piece of it, can be
injected into a person to trigger a primary response without
producing disease (or, at worst, producing only a mild form
of the illness). Immunization thus primes the immune system
to respond efficiently and without delay upon encountering
the real pathogen. Table 24.1 lists a variety of viral and
bacterial diseases for which immunizations are available.

These two antibody classes are displayed like tiny satellite
dishes on the B-cell surface, anchored by their Fc regions
through hydrophobic transmembrane segments. These
surface antibodies are the keys to stimulating the proliferation and differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing
plasma cells or memory B cells. Upon binding to its corresponding antigen via these surface antibodies, the B cell is
said to become activated, whereby it multiplies and differentiates into a plasma cell that ultimately synthesizes only
one antibody isotype (for example, IgG1 or IgA2). Clonal
selection has begun. In addition to antigen binding, most
B cells require help from T cells to become plasma cells and
memory B cells (discussed later).

B-cell receptors. A microbe generally has multiple copies
of the same epitope on its surface (think about a virus capsid). Each epitope can bind adjacent B-cell receptors on one

one protein to another, usually ending up on, and activating, a transcriptional regulator. The transcription factors at

There are two routes by which antigens can stimulate
B cells to differentiate into plasma cells. In one, called
the T cell–independent route, antigens that possess multiple repeating epitopes (for example, polysaccharide antigens) can directly cross-link B-cell receptors (the capping
process)—a step necessary for triggering differentiation
(see Fig. 24.16 and Special Topic 24.1). Proteins, however, which are the largest group of antigens, do not contain multiple repeating units. Proteins possess many small,
discrete, single epitopes, making the cross-linking of B-cell
receptors difficult. B-cell responses to these types of antigens require help from specific T cells, and this constitutes
the second route to B-cell activation. Thus, B cells usually
require multiple signals to initiate a primary response. How

SPECIAL TOPIC 24.1+ + Can Retroviruses Help B Cells?
The differentiation of B cells into antibody-producing plasma
cells first requires that antigen bind to B-cell receptors
(BCRs). However, a second signal to the B cell is required
to complete B-cell activation. For most antigens, the second signal involves B-cell interaction with helper T cells
(T cell–dependent antigens; see Section 24.3). However, some
antigens successfully stimulate B-cell differentiation without
T-cell help. These antigens are called T cell–independent (TI)
antigens and come in two forms: TI-1 antigens bind BCR and
engage Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as the second signal. TI-2
antigens are large molecules with highly repetitive structures;
for example, bacterial capsular polysaccharides and viral capsids. These highly repetitive structures cause extensive crosslinking of surface BCR molecules. Until recently, the second
signal for TI-2 antigens was unknown.
In a surprising finding, Bruce Beutler (who received the
2011 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine for the discovery of Toll-like receptors) (Fig. 1A) and his colleagues at the
University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center discovered
that endogenous retroviruses provide the help B cells need
to respond to TI-2 antigens. Endogenous retroviral DNA
sequences are the “footprints” of previous retroviral infections (see Chapter 11). Mammalian genomes, including human,
are rife with latent retroviruses, some of which can still replicate to form virus-like particles. It is startling that these remnants of past infection may also play a role in immunity. So,
what led the scientists to this conclusion?

Suspecting that an innate immune signaling pathway in the
B cell was involved in TI-2 responses, Beutler’s team screened
a series of genetically engineered mice missing different pattern recognition receptors (such as TLRs and NLRs) or signaling pathways for an ability to make IgM when challenged
with a TI-2 antigen called NP (Fig. 1B). Of all the pathways
tested, only mice missing the cGAS-STING or Mavs pathways
were deficient in producing NP-specific IgM. So, too, were
lkbkg mutant mice that are defective in the synthesis of the
transcription factor NF-κB. The STING and cGAS proteins
are components of a cytoplasmic DNA sensor, whereas the
Mavs protein is an adaptor for the cytoplasmic RNA sensor
RIG-I. The results indicated that cytoplasmic RNA or DNA is
required for TI-2 antigen stimulation of B cells.
Where did these cytoplasmic nucleic acids come from? An
external source was highly unlikely, but could the cytoplasmic nucleic acids come from endogenous retroviruses (ERVs)
lying latent in the cell nucleus? When tested, NP-specific
B cells isolated from mice immunized with NP had higher levels of various ERV RNAs bound to the RNA sensor RIG-I than
did nonspecific B cells (Fig. 2A). The scientists then showed
that cross-linking BCR with anti-IgM antibodies also induced
ERV replication (Fig. 2B) and that inhibiting reverse transcriptase before NP immunization limited anti-NP antibody
production. Retroviral reverse transcriptase synthesizes ERV
RNA from retroviral DNA templates.

From these and many other experiments, the authors propose the following events after TI-2 immunization (Fig. 3): (1)
TI-2 antigens cross-link BCRs on B cells, setting off a signal
cascade leading to the production of the NF-κB transcription
factor. (2) NF-κB stimulates transcription of ERV proviruses,
and the resulting RNAs are transported to the cytoplasm. (3)
ERV mRNAs are translated to produce reverse transcriptase
along with other viral proteins. (4) Reverse transcriptase produces cDNA from ERV mRNA. (5) ERV mRNAs and cDNAs
present in the cytoplasm activate RIG-I and cGAS, respectively.
The result is B-cell activation and differentiation to IgM-producing plasma cells.
One possible ramification of this finding is that the continuous stimulation of mucosal B cells by microbiota might
increase the expression of endogenous retroviruses. The
effect that retroviral expression might then have on antibody
production at mucosal surfaces is unclear.

cells. Extensive cross-linking activates a signal cascade leading to
transcription of retroviral DNA. Resulting viral RNA and/or cDNA
activate the cytoplasmic RNA-sensing (e.g. Rig-1) and/or DNAsensing (e.g. cGAS-STING) pathways. Resulting signals induce
the activation and expansion of B cells and differentiation into
plasma cells.

This report provides compelling, but circumstantial, evidence
of retroviral involvement in TI-2 antibody responses. What
“heroic” experiment would definitively prove that ERVs produce the second signal needed for this response?

T cells help foster B-cell activation will be discussed in Section 24.3. During B-cell activation, antibody heavy-chain
isotype switching (or class switching) can occur at the gene
level. Class, or isotype, switching changes the class of antibodies produced. For example, some B cells will switch
from making the IgM isotype to making the IgA isotype.
Figure 24.17 summarizes the basic steps of antibody
formation leading to the production of plasma cells and
memory cells. More detailed descriptions of these events
follow in the next section.

Genetics of Antibody Production

Before we discuss how T cells influence antibody production, let’s jump ahead and look at the process leading to antibody diversity. It is estimated that each human
can synthesize 1011 different antibodies. Given that each
B cell displays antibodies to only one antigenic determinant, it follows that there are 1011 different B cells in the
body. We have learned, however, that each person possesses only about a thousand genes or gene segments
involved in antibody formation. How are 1011 different

CHAPTER 24

antibodies made from only 103 genes? Susumu Tonegawa
was awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovering that antibody genes can move and
rearrange themselves within the genome of a differentiating cell. Three steps are involved: (1) the rearrangement
of antibody gene segments (or cassettes), (2) the random
introduction of somatic mutations, and (3) the generation of different codons during antibody gene splicing.
In humans, antibody diversity is generated continually
over a lifetime.
Making the antigen-binding site. The fi rst step in making
a specific antibody occurs during the formation of a B cell
from a progenitor stem cell (progenitor B cell) in bone marrow, before a foreign antigen is encountered. This process
happens throughout a person’s life. Immunoglobulin genes
in a bone marrow progenitor B cell have many gene segments that can rearrange in many possible combinations.
During differentiation into a mature B cell, DNA segments
are deleted in a process called gene switching, which
decreases the number of gene segments in the mature
B-cell DNA. The process starts at the 5´ end of an immunoglobulin gene cluster corresponding to the ultimate antigen-binding site (Fig. 24.18).
In both the heavy- and light-chain genes are a number of
tandem gene cassettes encoding potential variable regions
(antigen-binding sites) separated by recombination signal
sequences (RSSs). RSSs allow recombination to bring
two widely separated gene segments together. There
are approximately 170 variable region (V-region) gene
segments for the heavy and light chains. The light-chain
V-region gene cluster lies upstream of a cluster of J-region
(“J” for “joint” or “joining”) genes that will eventually
join a variable region to a light-chain constant region (C).
Genes for the constant region reside farther downstream
in the DNA. The arrangement of the heavy-chain genes
is slightly more complex. In this case, the heavy-chain
V cluster is followed by a D (diversity) cluster and then the
J region.

Note:

Do not confuse the J-region gene segments used to
make heavy- and light-chain proteins with the J-chain protein that
holds together IgM and IgA multimers. They are completely different and unrelated. The J-region gene segments do not encode the
J chain.

A summary of the genetic processes leading to antibody
formation is shown in Figure 24.18. Antibody formation
begins with a recombination event between RSS sites at
one D and one J segment, which deletes all the intervening
D and J segments (Fig. 24.18, step 1). Next, the new DJ
region joins to one of the V segments, deleting all of the
intervening V and D segments (step 2). The result is a

■

joined VDJ DNA sequence, which can then be transcribed
(step 3). Each V segment has its own promoter. However, if
extra V segments remain upstream of the rearranged VDJ
sequence on the DNA, then the only promoter that will
fire is the one immediately upstream of the rearranged VDJ
segment. The primary RNA transcript will then undergo
RNA splicing to remove any J-segment RNA sequences
that remain downstream of the VDJ RNA sequence
(step 3). The result is a mature B cell that can synthesize a
specific antibody (steps 4–6). Remember, all of the DNA
recombination and RNA splicing happens before the B cell
ever “sees” the antigen. Consequently, the mature B cell
is called naive because it has not yet been stimulated by
antigen.
A similar sequence of events occurs for the light chains,
except that the product is VJ. Table 24.3 illustrates the
amount of antibody diversity that can be achieved in
humans simply by this combinatorial re-joining (a total of
about 5 × 106 antigens can be recognized).
Where does the rest of antigen-binding-site diversity
arise? After recombination, the V regions of the germ lines
are susceptible to high levels of somatic mutation (called
hypermutation), resulting in the hypervariable regions.
Hypermutation happens every time a memory B cell is
exposed to the antigen; the memory B cells divide and the
hypervariable regions mutate. Additional diversity comes
from the junctions of VJ and VDJ, where recombinational
joining can occur between different nucleotides. Each gene
recombination event can generate additional codons, so the
resulting peptides will differ by one or more amino acids.
The interactions between the light- and heavy-chain hypervariable regions in an antibody form the antigen-binding
sites.
In sum, a combination of gene recombination and
random mutations gives us the remarkable level of antigenbinding-site diversity that we each possess. As noted earlier,
the human body is capable of responding to 1011 antigens,
yet there are only 108 antigens in nature. This apparent
overkill suggests that the immune system is well prepared
to cope with any possible antigen it could encounter.
Unfortunately for humans, enterprising microbes, such
as the trypanosomes that cause sleeping sickness, can stay
one step ahead of the immune system by changing the
structure of key surface antigens. Changing the antigenic
structure of a protein renders useless those antibodies
made to the previous structure.
It isn’t hard to understand why multicellular organisms,
like humans, need the capacity to make any one of billions
of different antibodies quickly. Pathogens can undergo
many generations of growth within the single life span of
a human host. So, humans have to generate recombinant
clones of cells quickly to overcome rapidly dividing
pathogens.

DNA between the VDJ region and one of the constant
regions. The primary RNA transcript produced after
this recombination event has all of its introns spliced out
before translation. Because the VDJ region is the same
regardless of which CH gene is selected, the antibody
produced will have the same antigenic specificity as the
original IgM. However, the heavy-chain switch selection
process is not random. The type of cytokine present at
the time of the switch will influence which C H gene is
selected.
Note that any heavy-chain peptide (alpha, gamma, delta,
and so on) can combine with any light chain (lambda or
kappa). However, a single, mature B cell can make only one
type of heavy chain and one type of light chain.

Thought Questions

24.7 B cells in early stages have both IgM and IgD surface
antibodies, but the delta region has no switch region. Why
does the delta region have no switch region?

■

24.8 Why do individuals with type A blood have anti-B and
not anti-A antibodies?
■

Making memory B cells. Having encountered an antigen,

the antigen-activated B cell will divide to make memory
B cells, as well as plasma cells (see Figs. 24.14 and 24.17).
Memory B cells are B cells that have already undergone
class switching (committed to making IgG, for instance)
but are very long-lived. Their long lives provide immunological memory. But why do they survive longer than regular B cells? Part of the reason is the production of what one
might call an “anti-suicide” protein called Mcl-1. B cells
that do not encounter their matched antigen eventually
undergo a process of programmed cell death (apoptosis).
However, if the B-cell receptor binds to its matched (cognate) antigen, then a signal is sent to the nucleus to make
the Mcl-1 anti-apoptosis protein. The memory-B-cell line
can now propagate for many years, guarding the person
against microbial assault.
During their lifetimes, memory B cells, like other
B cells, hypermutate the antigen-binding regions of
antibody genes (the VDJ and VJ regions). These mutations
increase the affinity of the antibody produced during
the secondary response; that is, the hypermutation helps
sharpen the antigen-binding site, making it even more
specific toward a given microbe or antigen. Note, too, that
as an immune response clears an infection, the antigen
becomes scarce. This means that only B cells with the
highest-affinity antibodies as part of their B-cell receptors
will remain activated. This process is known as affinity
maturation.

■

Antibodies, or immunoglobulins, are Y-shaped molecules that contain two heavy chains and two light
chains. There are five classes (isotypes) of antibodies.
Each antibody isotype is defined by the structure of the
heavy chain. Antibodies are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily.
Each antibody molecule contains two antigen-binding sites. Each binding site is formed by the hypervariable ends of a heavy- and light-chain pair. The Fc portion
(“tail”) of an antibody can bind to specific receptors on
host cells. This binding is antigen independent.
Antibody diversity (idiotype) occurs via a complex
series of splicing events between adjacent DNA cassettes,
as well as mutational events in DNA sequences encoding
the hypervariable regions of heavy and light chains.
Mature (naive) B cells have completed VDJ rearrangements in their DNA to make the specific antigen-binding site for antibodies. The naive B cell places IgM and
IgD antibodies on its surface (part of B-cell receptors).
A B-cell receptor consists of a membrane-embedded
antibody in association with the Igα and Igβ proteins.
Binding of antigen to the B-cell receptor triggers B-cell
proliferation and differentiation.
Clonal selection is the rapid proliferation of a subset of
B cells during the primary or secondary antibody response.
The primary antibody response to an antigen begins
when B cells differentiate into antibody-producing plasma
cells and memory B cells. IgM antibodies are generally the
first class of antibodies made during the primary response.
The secondary antibody response occurs during subsequent exposures to an antigen. Memory B cells are
activated, hypermutate the VDJ region, and then rapidly proliferate and differentiate into antibody-secreting
plasma cells. IgG is the predominant antibody made.
Isotype switching (or class switching) from IgM production to other antibody isotypes occurs after naive
B cells bind their target antigen. The B-cell receptors on
a single B cell are made of a single antibody isotype that
specifically binds one epitope.

24.3

T cells Link Antibody and
Cellular Immune Systems

Do the two arms of the adaptive immune system (antibodybased and cell-mediated) know each other exist? Because
different types of infections tilt the immune response one

CHAPTER 24

way or the other, the systems must communicate with each
other to provide balance. T-cell lymphocytes, with integral roles in both antibody production and cell-mediated
immunity, manage the balance.
Although derived from the same progenitor stem cell
as B cells (see Fig. 23.17), T cells develop in the thymus
(rather than in the bone marrow, where B cells develop),
and they contain surface protein antigens different from
those of B cells. T cells come in several varieties marked
by the presence of different cell differentiation (CD), or
cluster of differentiation, surface proteins and by the types
of cytokines they produce. Two critically important groups
are helper T cells (already mentioned) and cytotoxic T cells
(TC cells). Helper T cells display the surface antigen CD4,
while cytotoxic T cells display CD8. Cytotoxic T cells are
the “enforcers” of the cell-mediated immune response.
They destroy the membranes of host cells infected with
viruses or bacteria.
Our understanding of helper T cells has evolved over the
last few years. Helper T cells come in several models, the
first of which is the T H0 cell. T H0 cells are precursors to
the other types, including:
■

T FH (follicular helper T cells), a heterogeneous set
of CD4 T cells that drive B-cell differentiation into
antibody-secreting plasma cells. Different T FH cell subsets secrete different combinations of cytokines that
trigger antibody isotype class switching.

A. Major histocompatibility proteins
Class I MHC

Peptidebinding area
α1

S S

T H 2 cells recruit eosinophils to combat parasitic infections and can inhibit T H1 proliferation.

■

T H17 cells stimulate inflammation by secreting IL-17, a
pro-inflammatory cytokine. IL-17 helps trigger recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages to an infection.

■

Treg (regulatory T cells) dampen the inflammatory
response and secrete the anti-inflammatory cytokine
IL-10.

The ratios of these cells and the cytokines they produce tilt
the immune system toward either more humoral or more
cell-mediated responses. To be of any use, however, T cells
first must be activated by antigen.

T-Cell Activation Requires
Antigen Presentation

Unlike B cells, T cells never bind free-floating antigen.
T cells are activated only by antigen bound to another cell’s
surface. These other cells are collectively called antigenpresenting cells (APCs) because they present antigens to
T cells. The APC surface proteins that hold and present
the antigen are known as major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins (Fig. 24.20A). MHC proteins differ
between species and between individuals within a species.
They help determine whether a given antigen is recognized

as coming from the host (a self antigen) or from another
source (a foreign antigen), in a phenomenon called histocompatibility (hence the name “major histocompatibility
complex”). The salient feature of all MHC molecules is
that they bind antigen that has entered the host cell, and
then present the antigen back on the cell surface. MHC
molecules are critical to the immune system because the

T cell, to be activated, must first recognize a foreign antigen attached to an MHC molecule on an APC.
Two classes of MHC molecules are found on cell surfaces. Both classes belong to the immunoglobulin family of
proteins, but they are not immunoglobulins (antibodies).
Class I MHC molecules are found on all nucleated cells,
whereas class II MHC molecules have a more limited

CHAPTER 24

T-cell receptors (TCRs) are the antigen-binding molecules present on the surfaces of T cells (Fig. 24.22).
Unlike BCRs, TCRs are not antibodies. A TCR on
helper T cells will bind only to antigens attached to
MHC surface proteins on antigen-presenting cells, as
noted earlier. However, the TCRs of cytotoxic T cells
can bind viral antigens present on any virus-infected
cell, whether or not that cell is normally considered
an APC.
The T-cell receptor is composed of several
transmembrane proteins. Two molecules—alpha and
beta—make up the part that recognizes antigen. Much
like antibodies, the alpha and beta proteins of the
TCR are formed from gene clusters that undergo gene
rearrangements analogous to, but different from, the
immunoglobulin genes.
The TCR alpha and beta proteins are found in a
complex with four other peptides, which together form
the CD3 complex (see Fig. 24.22). When stimulated
by binding antigen, these ancillary CD3 complex
proteins recruit and activate intracellular protein kinases
and launch a phosphorylation cascade that triggers
proliferation of the T cell and key immunological events
that we describe later in the chapter.

How are foreign antigens placed, or presented, on host
cell surfaces? In the initial stages of an immune response,
antigen-presenting cells internalize the pathogen, such as
a virus or a bacterium. Inside the APCs, pathogen proteins are degraded into smaller peptides (epitopes). These
epitopes are placed within the MHC-binding clefts of
MHC I or II molecules and transported back to the cell
surface.
Whether an antigen peptide binds to class I or class II
MHC molecules generally depends on how the antigen
initially entered the cell (Fig. 24.21). Endogenous antigens,
which are synthesized by viruses and intracellular bacteria
as they grow within the cytoplasm of an APC, will attach
to class I MHC molecules on the endoplasmic reticulum
and are moved to the cell surface (Fig. 24.21 left). In
contrast, exogenous antigens, which are produced outside
of the APC (as are most bacterial antigens), will enter the
cell via phagocytosis and attach to class II MHC molecules
moved to the acidic phagosome or lysosome (Fig. 24.21
right). The MHC class II–peptide complex is then carried
to the cell surface. Once the antigen is presented on the
APC cell surface, T cells can interact with the antigenMHC complex via the T-cell receptors (discussed next).
Interactions between antigen-presenting cells and naive
T cells occur within the lymph nodes, the spleen, or Peyer’s
patches in the gut. So APCs must make their way to those
locations to generate an immune response.

distribution on professional APCs such as dendritic cells,
B cells, and macrophages.
The surface CD proteins CD8 and CD4 mentioned
earlier help T cells distinguish between MHC class I and
class II molecules on antigen-presenting cells. The CD8
molecules on TC cells selectively bind MHC class I, while
CD4 molecules on T H cells selectively bind MHC class II.
Antigens presented on class I MHC molecules generally
arise from intracellular pathogens, such as viruses and some
bacteria that require cell-mediated immunity for resolution.
In contrast, antigen peptides presented on class II MHC
molecules originate from extracellular infections, which
are resolved by antibody and are recognized only by CD4
T H cells.

acids in the peptide sequences. Once bound to antigen, the complex
transduces a signal into the cell. This signal triggers T-cell proliferation.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Why don’t your T cells see your body’s antigens? Are
they tolerant somehow? Actually, T cells that strongly bind
self antigens are not made tolerant; they are killed in a
process called T-cell education.

T-Cell Education and Deletion

Greek mythology tells of Narcissus, a young man punished
by the gods for scorning the women who fell in love with
him. One day Narcissus saw a beautiful face in a pool of
water. Not knowing it was his own reflection, he fell in
love, tumbled into the pool, and drowned. His inability to
recognize himself is analogous to the danger posed by an
immune system. Immune systems must be able to distinguish what is self (meaning antigens present in our own
tissues) from what is not self. Otherwise our immune system would constantly attack our own cells. Innate immunity accomplishes this important task, in part, through
the use of pattern recognition proteins such as the Tolllike and NOD-like receptors (see Section 23.5). How adaptive immune mechanisms avoid recognizing self is equally
important. At the outset of development, the immune system is fully capable of reacting against self.
One mechanism the body uses to avoid attacking
itself is to delete any T cells that strongly react against
self antigens. T cells undergo a two-stage selection or
“education” process in the thymus to recognize self versus
nonself. T cells bearing T-cell receptors (TCRs) that
weakly recognize self MHC proteins displayed on thymus
epithelial cells are allowed to survive (positive selection)
and leave the thymus to seed secondary lymphoid organs
such as the spleen. T cells in the thymus that recognize self
MHC peptides too strongly, however, are killed, or deleted
from the population (negative selection). Almost 95% of
T cells entering the thymus die during these positive and
negative selection processes.
This weeding out is important because if our T-cell
repertoire included cells that bound self MHC too tightly,
then our T cells would constantly react to our own MHC
molecules, regardless of which antigen peptides were
attached. Note, however, that some self-reactive T cells
are allowed to survive and are converted into regulatory
T cells (Tregs). Regulatory T cells can block the activation
of harmful, self-reactive (autoimmune) lymphocytes that
escape deletion and enter the circulation. Note that this is
the first way that Tregs can be made. The second involves
APC activation of T H0 cells, discussed later.
Why is positive selection that promotes weak binding to
MHC molecules important? The positive selection process
is needed because T cells must be able to recognize self
MHC proteins before the T-cell receptor can bind the
MHC-associated antigen. Consequently, T cells from
one individual normally do not recognize peptides placed

on antigen-presenting cells from another individual—a
property known as MHC restriction. CD4 T H cells are
class II MHC restricted, while CD8 TC cells are class I
restricted.
Rolf Zinkernagel (University of Zurich) and Peter
Doherty (St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, Memphis)
discovered the MHC restriction phenomenon in 1976
with a simple experiment. They demonstrated that mouse
cytotoxic T cells would efficiently kill virus-infected
target cells having an MHC I surface protein identical to
that of the T cell, but failed to kill infected cells containing
a different MHC I protein from a different strain of mouse.
Thus, T-cell recognition has two components: self (the
MHC molecule) and nonself (the antigen). This discovery
won Zinkernagel and Doherty the 1996 Nobel Prize in
Physiology or Medicine.
Why transplanted organs with one MHC type are
prone to rejection by a recipient of a different MHC type is
explained in eTopic 24.3.
Where are T cells “educated”? In contrast to negative
selection for B cells, which occurs in bone marrow, T-cell
education is limited to the thymus. But if the thymus
expresses only thymus antigens, how can T cells that
respond to antigens expressed on other host cells (for
example, heart cells) be removed? The answer is a special
gene activator called AIRE in thymus cells that stimulates
the synthesis of all human proteins in small amounts. This
expression is necessary to complete T-cell education within
the thymus.
You might ask how someone whose thymus has been
removed (done as a treatment for myasthenia gravis) can
live if the organ is critical for T-cell maturation and for
deleting self-reactive T cells. Actually, the thymus begins
losing function shortly after birth, such that very little
function remains in adults. Fortunately, a large amount of
T-cell education occurs during fetal development. Once
a T cell is educated, reserve pools of these T cells are
maintained throughout life outside of the thymus. Some
T cells, apparently, can also mature in secondary lymphoid
tissues. Thus, adults without a thymus can live relatively
normal lives. Babies born without a thymus, however, have
a severe, life-threatening T-cell deficit.

APCs Activate TH0 Helper T cells

Figure 24.23
summarizes the steps that lead to T-cell
activation in the lymph node and highlights how activated T cells influence the two types of adaptive immunity:
humoral (antibody) and cellular. The different classes of
T cells, T H and TC, require different but interrelated activation programs. First we consider TH cell activation. T H
cells require two molecular signals to become active. T-cell
receptors on precursor T H0 cells first recognize and link to

■ Summary of the activation of humoral and cell-mediated pathways. Left: Extracellular pathogens tend to
activate humoral immunity (B cells). Right: Intracellular pathogens generally activate cell-mediated immunity by stimulating cytotoxic T cells
(CD8 marker). The balance between cell-mediated and humoral immune responses to a given infection is regulated by the balance between
the production of TH1 (cell-mediated) versus other TH (antibody) helper T cells. This balance is influenced by whether the foreign antigen was
made by intracellular pathogens (TH1-favored) or extracellular pathogens. TH1 cells will encourage activation of cytotoxic T cells (cell-mediated
immunity; best for killing intracellular pathogens), while TFH cells will promote antibody production (humoral immunity; best for attacking
extracellular pathogens). See text for more details.

antigen-MHC proteins on antigen-presenting cells (APCs)
(Fig. 24.23, step 1a). In the case of T H0 cells, the MHC
molecules are class II. The second signal needed to activate
a T H0 cell is the binding of a CD28 molecule present on
the T H0 cell surface to a B7 protein on the APC cell surface
(also step 1a). Different cytokines produced by mast cells,
macrophages, epithelial cells, and so on, during infection
then convert activated T H0 cells to T FH, T H1, T H 2, T H17,
or Treg cells (step 2a). The activation of cytotoxic T cells
(TC cells) will be examined later.

TFH Cells Activate B Cells

During the early phase of a primary response, one type of
B cell in the lymph node can become activated after binding antigen if the B cell also binds to complement C3 on
a bacterium (see Section 23.6), or if a microbe-associated
molecular pattern (MAMP) binds to a Toll-like or NODlike receptor on or in the B cell (see Section 23.5). This activation does not result in heavy-chain class switching; only
IgM is secreted by the resulting plasma cell. This is partly
why the primary response starts with IgM (see Fig. 24.13).

968

■

PART 5

■

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

During the later stages of a primary response, however,
a helper T cell is required to activate most B cells after the
B-cell receptor binds antigen (Fig. 24.23, step 3). This
assistance is called T-cell help. Interactions between B cells
and T cells primarily take place in areas of lymph nodes
called follicles (see the Current Research Highlight). The
follicular helper T cell (T FH) is the primary T cell involved
in driving B-cell activation. (Actually, any T H cell other
than T H0 and Treg can activate a B cell to make antibody,
but to a lesser extent.)
T-cell help is specific to the antigen and triggers heavychain class switching. But how does a B cell gain specific
T-cell help? The specific T FH cell must have a TCR able
to bind the same antigen that the B cell binds. This way
the T FH cell “knows” which B cell to help. As part of the
B-cell receptor capping mechanism (antigen cross-linking
of BCR), some antigen bound by B-cell receptors becomes
internalized and processed to be presented back on the
B cell’s surface MHC receptor (Fig. 24.23, step 3). For
instance, a T FH cell that was activated by dendritic cells
presenting antigen A (step 1a) can also use its T-cell receptor
to bind antigen A presented on a B-cell MHC II molecule
(step 3). This contact allows CD40 on the B cell to bind
CD154 on the T cell—an interaction that completes the
activation of the B cell. The B cell will now differentiate
into a plasma cell (Fig. 24.23, step 3).
The isotype class switch from IgM to another antibody
type is directed by cytokines secreted by the T FH cell. For
instance, IL-4 and IFN-gamma trigger the switch from
IgM to IgE and IgG, respectively.
During the secondary immune response, memory
B cells also need T-cell help to become plasma cells, but
direct contact with helper T cells is not required. Memory
B cells that have antigen bound to their B-cell receptors can
respond to the soluble IL-4 and IL-6 cytokines secreted by
activated helper T cells without having direct contact with
the T H cell. IL-4 stimulates B-cell proliferation, while IL-6
directs differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells.

signal is the binding of T-cell receptors (TCRs) to antigen–MHC class I complexes on an antigen-presenting cell
(Fig. 24.23, step 1b). CD8 on the TC cell recognizes an
MHC I–antigen complex on the APC. Because class I MHC
molecules are found on all nucleated cells, any infected cell
can potentially activate TC cells, converting them to cells
that ultimately kill the infected cell. Figure 24.24A takes a
closer look at signal 1 interaction.

TH1 Cells Activate Cytotoxic T Cells

Because they directly attack host cells, CD8 TC cells are
the major “enforcers” of the cellular immune system, along
with macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells. TC cells,
however, are not actually cytotoxic until they are activated.
As with helper T cells, activation of cytotoxic T cells takes
place in the lymph node and requires two signals. The first

■ Presentation of a viral antigen to a T cell
and cytotoxic T-cell action. A. CD8 protein on a T cell directs

the interaction between a T-cell receptor and a viral antigen bound
to a class I MHC protein on an antigen-presenting cell. Signal 2
for activation of cytotoxic T cells is an interaction between B7 (on
an APC) and CD28 on a TC cell, described in the text (not shown).
B. The activated TC cell then leaves the lymph node and migrates
to the site of infection, where it can recognize the viral peptide
presented on the MHC class I receptor on an infected cell. This
interaction authorizes the cytotoxic T cell to kill the infected cell.

CHAPTER 24

The second signal needed to activate TC cells is a
B7-to-CD28 interaction that further links the APC to the
TC cell. This is the same second signal described earlier for
helper T cells. Once activated, the TC cell gains cytotoxic
activity and places receptors for the cytokine IL-2 on its
surface. IL-2 secreted by the T H1 class of helper T cells
(activated earlier) binds to the IL-2 receptors and stimulates
proliferation of the cytotoxic T cell (Fig. 24.23, step 2b).
The resulting “platoon” of activated cytotoxic T cells moves
from the lymph node to the site of infection, killing any
cell bearing the same peptide–MHC class I complex (for
example, cells infected with the same virus that triggered
TC production) (Fig. 24.24B).
Activated cytotoxic T cells kill infected target cells by
releasing the contents of their granules, which contain the
proteins granzyme and perforin. Perforin produces a pore
in the target cell membrane through which granzymes
can enter. In the cytoplasm, granzymes cleave and activate
caspase proteins in the infected cell. The activated caspases
then trigger apoptosis and cell death. The infected host cell
is sacrificed for the good of the whole animal, human or
otherwise.
Why are cytotoxic T cells more effective than B cells
and antibodies at clearing viral infections? A major reason
is that intracellular pathogens (for example, viruses) hide
inside host cells, where they are protected from antibody.
Consequently, these pathogens are best killed when the
harboring host cell is also sacrificed (via cellular immunity).
Because all nucleated cells have class I MHC molecules, any
infected cell can be recognized and killed by an appropriate
TC cell for the good of the host.

TH17 Cells Promote, and Treg
Cells Limit, Inflammation

The immune system is full of checks and balances. Two
sets of T cells critical to regulating the immune response
are TH17 cells that amplify inflammation, and regulatory T cells (Tregs) that dampen inflammation. T H17
cells are derived from T H0 cells and are characterized
by their secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-17.
T H17 cells are the first subset of T cells generated during
an infection. Receptors for IL-17 are expressed on fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and keratinocytes. Contact with
IL-17 causes the production of IL-6 to initiate fever,
chemokines like CXCL8 (IL-8) to recruit neutrophils
and macrophages, and granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factors (GM-CSFs) to enhance synthesis of
these phagocytes in bone marrow. IL-22, also produced
by T H17 cells, cooperates with IL-17 to induce synthesis of antimicrobial peptides, such as beta-defensins, in
epidermal keratinocytes. Altogether, T H17 cells enhance
the innate acute inflammatory response to infection.

■

THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE

■

969

However, the problem with inflammation is that it also
causes damage to local tissues. This is where Treg cells
become crucial.
Treg cells either form during T-cell selection in the
thymus (mentioned earlier), or differentiate from T H0
cells in a lymph node. Treg cells are involved in shutting
down immune responses after an invading organism
has successfully been eliminated, and can prevent
autoimmunity. Once activated by an antigen presented to
its TCR receptor, Treg cells secrete the anti-inflammatory
cytokine IL-10. IL-10 inhibits inflammatory cytokine
secretion by macrophages (TNF, IL-1, and IL-12), reduces
MHC II expression in macrophages, blocks macrophage
activation by IFN-gamma, and blocks cytokine IL-2
production from T H1 cells, thereby limiting production of
cytotoxic T cells (see Fig. 24.23).
Ratios of T H17 to Treg cells vary depending on the
severity of an infection, either exacerbating or quelling
inflammation. The cytokines produced by APCs and other
cells during an infection can tilt the balance one way or the
other. In addition, Treg cells themselves can inhibit T H17
cell functions.

CD4 Helper T Cells and Cytokines
Balance the Immune Response

Antigens presented on class I MHC molecules elicit only
cell-mediated immunity (via CD8 T cells). Antigens presented on class II molecules can stimulate both arms of
the immune system by activating CD4 helper T cells. CD4
T H cells do not kill host cells directly, but instead release
various cytokines that incite other cells to do the killing.
IL-8, for instance, attracts additional white blood cells to
the area. Activated T H1 cells secrete cytokines that stimulate cytotoxic TC cells (see Fig. 24.23, step 2b), as well
as macrophages and natural killer cells. However, sets of
activated T FH cells secrete different combinations of cytokines to trigger B cells to switch immunoglobulin classes
and differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibody (see
Fig. 24.23, step 3). Table 24.4 lists a fraction of the many
different cytokines produced by various cell types and
describes their influence over the immune system.
But what determines which class of T H cell predominates
during an infection? Part of the answer is found in the
blend of cytokines generated by macrophages or mast cells
during different types of infection. Infections by viruses
and intracellular bacteria, for instance, generate cytokines,
such as IFN-gamma, that favor the production of T H1 cells.
T H1 cells promote cell-mediated immunity. Infections
by extracellular bacteria and parasites, however, generate
IL-4, which inhibits T H0 differentiation into T H1 cells, so
antibody-mediated immunity is favored (see Fig. 24.23,
step 2a).

As a result, once the immune system starts to go down one
pathway, the other pathway is held back. But this is not an
all-or-none response. For instance, a viral infection will also
result in TFH cells that stimulate antibody production. The tilt
toward TH1 or TFH predominance occurs because the body
realizes which pathway—cell-mediated (TH1) or humoral
(TFH)—will more effectively clear a particular infection.
The importance of CD4 T cells in immunity is tragically
illustrated by acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS; Chapter 11). The human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) binds to CD4 molecules to infect CD4 T cells. As
the disease progresses, the number of CD4 T cells declines
below its normal level of about 1,000 per microliter. When
the number of CD4 T cells drops below 400 per microliter,
the ability of the patient to mount an immune response is
jeopardized. The patient not only becomes hypersusceptible
to infections by pathogens, but also becomes susceptible to
infections by commensal organisms. Most AIDS patients
actually die from these opportunistic infections.

Superantigens Do Not Require
Processing to Activate T Cells

To stimulate T-cell responses, normal antigens require processing by antigen-presenting cells. Each peptide produced

by antigen processing must be placed on an MHC molecule and presented to a cognate T cell. However, when an
antigen is introduced into a host, only a few T cells have
the proper TCR needed to recognize that antigen—in the
range of 1–100 cells per million. Proliferation of the T cells
through antigen-dependent activation increases their number and increases the immune response to that antigen.
Some proteins, called superantigens, indiscriminately
stimulate T cells by bypassing the normal route of
antigen processing. In fact, recognition as an antigen
is not even involved. Certain microbial toxins, such as
staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin (TSST), are
actually superantigens. As illustrated in Figure 24.25,
these proteins simultaneously bind to the outside of T-cell
receptors on T cells and to the MHC molecules on APCs
(for example, macrophages). This joining of the T cell and
macrophage activates more T cells than a typical immune
reaction does, stimulating the release of massive amounts
of inflammatory cytokines from both cell types.
The effect of superantigens can be devastating because
cytokines like tumor necrosis factor (TNF) will
overwhelm the host immune system’s regulatory network
and cause severe damage to tissues and organs. The result
is disease and sometimes death. Jim Henson, the creator
of Kermit the Frog and other Muppet characters, died in

1990 from complications of pneumonia caused by a potent
superantigen produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. This
example is but one of many ways that overreaction by the
immune system causes morbidity (disease) and mortality
(death)—effects more pronounced than the direct effects
of the pathogen involved.

Microbial Evasion of Adaptive Immunity

As efficient as our immune system is, numerous viral and
bacterial pathogens have developed effective means for
avoiding the adaptive immune response. Many viruses
produce proteins that down-regulate production of class I
MHC molecules on infected cell surfaces. Down-regulation
of MHC I will limit antigen presentation, since MHC I is
needed for that process. On the other hand, losing MHC I
should expose the infected host cell to natural killer cells
because NK cells attack peers that lack MHC I (discussed
in Section 23.5). To surmount this obstacle, for example,
human cytomegalovirus places a decoy MHC I–like molecule on the surface of infected cells. These decoys are
thought to bind inhibitory receptors on NK surfaces that
block NK cell cytotoxicity.

■ Superantigens. A. The
difference between the presentation of antigen
and superantigen. Antigen presentation requires
the antigen to bind within the binding pockets
of MHC and TCR molecules. Superantigens do
not require processing. They can bind directly to
the outer aspects of the TCR and MHC proteins, linking and activating the two cell types.
B. Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome toxin
is one example of a potent superantigen. Alpha
helices are shown as red ribbons, while sections
of the beta sheet are shown as blue ribbons.
(PDB code: 2QIL)

Like viruses, bacteria are masters of illusion when it
comes to the immune system. A major cause of gastric
ulcers, Helicobacter pylori, expresses proteins from a
cluster of pathogenicity genes that trigger apoptosis
(programmed cell death) of T cells. Other bacteria have
evolved mechanisms that interfere with signal transduction
pathways controlling the expression of cytokines. For
example, YopP from Yersinia enterocolitica, one cause
of gastroenteritis, inhibits a specific signal transduction
pathway needed to produce TNF, IL-1, and IL-8. Thus,
Yersinia avoids the detrimental effects of those proinflammatory cytokines.
Another method of immune avoidance is employed by
various mycobacteria, some of which cause tuberculosis and
leprosy (Fig. 24.26). These bacteria induce the production
of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which dampen the immune
response. Mycobacterium-infected macrophages produce
IL-6, which inhibits T-cell activation, and IL-10, which
down-regulates the production of MHC II molecules
needed for specific activation of T cells. Fortunately for
humans, in most cases the immune system catches on to
these tricks and, through redundant humoral and cellular
mechanisms, manages to resolve these infections.

F-actin (red) and the nucleus (blue).

Activated TH1 Cells Also Activate
Macrophages

Macrophages, too, must be activated to become highly
effective killers of microbes. Activation of macrophages
also requires two signals. One activation pathway involves
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) produced by nearby infected or
damaged cells, followed by binding of the macrophage to
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or other microbial components
via Toll-like or NOD-like receptors (TLRs or NLRs). Once
activated, the macrophage becomes aggressive in terms of
phagocytosis and increases production of numerous antimicrobial reactive oxygen intermediates.
As noted earlier, some bacterial pathogens, such as
mycobacteria, the causative agents of tuberculosis and
leprosy, grow primarily in the phagolysosomes of macrophages. There they are shielded from antibodies and cytotoxic T cells. Intracellular pathogens live in the usually
hostile environment of the phagocyte either by inhibiting the fusion of lysosomes to the phagosomes in which
they grow or by preventing the acidification of the vesicles needed to activate lysosomal proteases. However, a
macrophage activated by a T H1 cell can rid itself of such
pathogens. Even unactivated macrophages are able to process some of the intracellular bacteria and place antigen
from them on their class II MHC molecules. T H1 cells
then activate these macrophages through binding of their
TCR molecules to the macrophage MHC II–antigen complex and through secretion of IFN-gamma. The activated
macrophages can then kill any bacteria that may be growing within them.
Given that activated macrophages are such effective
assassins of microbial pathogens, why are macrophages
not always kept in an active state? A major reason is that
once activated, macrophages also damage nearby host tissue through the release of reactive oxygen radicals and

The major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) consists of membrane proteins
with variable regions that can bind antigens. Class I MHC molecules are on all
nucleated cells, while antigen-presenting
cells contain both class I and class II MHC
molecules.
Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) such as
dendritic cells present antigens synthesized
during an intracellular infection on their
surface class I MHC molecules, but place
antigens from engulfed microbes or allergens on their class II MHC molecules.

Activation of a TH0 cell requires two signals: TCRCD4 binding to an MHC II–antigen complex on an
antigen-presenting cell, and B7-CD28 interaction.
TH0 cell differentiation to T FH, T H1, T H 2, T H17, or
Treg cells is influenced by different cytokine “cocktails”
secreted by macrophages and NK cells during an
infection.
Activation of a B cell into an antibody-producing
plasma cell usually requires two signals: antigen binding
to a B-cell receptor and binding to a T FH cell activated
by the same antigen.
Activation of cytotoxic T cells requires two signals:
TCR-CD8 molecules that recognize MHC I–antigen
complexes on APCs, and B7-CD28 interactions. IL-2
secreted from activated T H1 cells stimulates cytotoxicT-cell proliferation. The activated cytotoxic T cells, in
turn, destroy infected host cells.
Superantigens abnormally stimulate T cells by
directly linking TCR on a T cell with MHC on an
APC without undergoing APC processing and surface
presentation.

THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE RESPONSE

973

Antigen

Complement as Part of
Adaptive Immunity

Chapter 23 describes how complement, in what is called
the alternative pathway, can attack invading microbes
before an adaptive immune response is launched (see
Section 23.6). Factor C3b binds to LPS and sets off a
reaction cascade ending with a membrane attack complex (MAC) pore composed of C5b, C6, C7, C8, and C9
proteins (see Fig. 23.36). However, antibody made during
the adaptive response to a pathogen offers another route
to activate complement called the classical complement
pathway. Dubbed “classical” because it was the first
complement pathway to be discovered, it requires a few
additional proteins before reaching C3, the linchpin factor
connecting the two pathways.
The classical cascade begins when a complement C1
protein complex binds to the Fc region of an antibody
bound to a bacterial or viral pathogen (Fig. 24.27). The
bound C1 complex then cleaves two other complement
factors, C2 and C4, not used in the alternative pathway.
Two fragments, one each from C2 and C4, combine to
form another protease, called C3 convertase, that cleaves
C3 into C3a and C3b. C3b in the alternative pathway is
stabilized by interacting with LPS. In the classical pathway,
however, C3b combines with C3 convertase to make a C5
convertase (note that this C5 convertase is different from
the C5 convertase formed in the alternative pathway; see
Fig. 23.36). The subsequent steps leading to formation
of a membrane attack complex (MAC) are the same as in
the alternative pathway. As before, C5b binds to a target
membrane and is joined by C6, C7, and C8. Multiple C9
proteins then assemble around the MAC and form a pore
that compromises the integrity of the target cell.
In Section 23.6 we noted the existence of another
complement activation pathway that does not require
antigen-antibody complexes. The lectin activation pathway
is initiated by lectins (produced by the liver), which recognize
and coat the sugar structures that decorate the surfaces of
infectious organisms. The lectin-coated polysaccharides
trigger cleavage of factor C4 to C4a and C4b. C4b can
cleave C2 and combine with one of the fragments to form
C3 convertase. C3 convertase then continues through the
classical activation pathway just described.
With all the other immune responses at our disposal,
why do we need complement? The need becomes evident
in individuals with complement deficiencies. These patients
are extremely susceptible to recurrent septicemic (blood)
infections by organisms such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae (the
cause of gonorrhea) that normally do not survive forays into
the bloodstream, because they are killed by complement.
Why does reinfecting Neisseria not quickly succumb to

all the other defenses, such as antibodies and cytotoxic
T cells? It turns out that key antigens on the bacterial
surface change shape over generations in a process called
phase variation (see Section 10.1). The new antigens are
“invisible” to antibodies made against earlier versions.

Regulating Complement Activation

How do normal body cells prevent self-destruction following complement activation? The sequential assembly
of the membrane attack complex provides several places
where regulatory factors can intervene. One such factor is

974

■

PART 5

■

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

the host cell-surface protein CD59. CD59 will bind any
C5b-C8 complex trying to form in the membrane and
prevent C9 from polymerizing. Thus, no pore is formed
and the host cell is spared. (Complement will not normally
attack uninfected or infected host cells, since both contain
CD59.)
Another regulatory mechanism hinges on a normal
serum protein called factor H. Factor H prevents the inadvertent activation of complement in the absence of infection. If factor H is unavailable, then the uncontrolled
activation of complement can damage host cells despite
the presence of CD59. To short-circuit the cascade, factor H binds to C3bBb, displaces Bb from the complex, and
acts as a cofactor for factor I protease, which then cleaves
C3b. Without C3b, the complement cascade stops. Some
bacteria, such as certain strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae,
have learned to protect themselves from complement by
binding factor H. Factor H bound to the microbe provides a protective “force field” against local complement
activation.
Microbiota can also assist host cells in resisting complement. The intestinal microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron
protects host cells from complement-mediated cytotoxicity by up-regulating a decay-accelerating factor present in
host cell membranes. Decay-accelerating factor stimulates
decay of complement factors and prevents their deposition
at the cell surface.

Other Roles for Complement
Fragments

The C3a, C4a, and C5a cleavage fragments generated
by the complement cascade do not participate in MAC
formation but are important for amplifying the immune
reaction. These peptides act as chemoattractants to lure
more inflammatory cells into the area. C3b, which does
participate in MAC formation, also can act as an opsonin when it is bound to a bacterial cell. An opsonin is
a protein factor that can facilitate phagocytosis. Because
phagocytes contain C3b receptors on their surfaces, it is
easier for them to grab and engulf cells coated with C3b.
Additional roles for complement fragments were discussed
in Section 23.6.

Thought Questions

24.12 Do bone marrow transplants in a patient with severe

combined immunodeficiency (SCID) require immunosuppressive chemotherapy?

24.13 How can a stem cell be differentiated from a B cell at
the level of DNA?

To Summarize
■

■

■

■

The classical pathway for complement activation
begins with an interaction between the Fc portion of an
antibody bound to an antigen and C1 factor in blood.
(The alternative pathway does not need antibody but
begins when C3b binds to LPS on a bacterium.)
The Fc-C1 complex reacts with C2 and C4, leading to
production of C3b and a novel C5 convertase specific to
the classical pathway.
After C5 convertase cleaves C5, the classical pathway
is the same as the alternative pathway, resulting in the
formation of a membrane attack complex (MAC).
CD59 and/or factor H prevents inappropriate MAC
formation in host cells.

Gut Mucosal Immunity
and the Microbiome

The mucosal surface of the gastrointestinal tract is exposed
to a vast number of food, chemical, and other ingested antigens. The gut also harbors an expansive microbiome whose
members must be controlled and nurtured. Monitoring
this large antigen load requires localized and highly integrated innate and adaptive immune systems, and a system
of gut-associated lymphoid tissues called GALT (see Section 23.4). The innate immune mechanisms that keep our
gut microbes at bay were described in Chapter 23, but the
intestine also has a dedicated adaptive immune system that
monitors and shapes our microbiota, usually without causing excessive inflammation. In this section we describe how
the innate and adaptive immune systems in the gut shape
the microbiome while protecting the host.

The Gut Immune System

We discussed in Chapter 21 how the gut microbial community helps digest our food and outcompetes pathogens
(see Fig. 21.21). Chapter 23 described how we acquire gut
microbiota and how dysbiosis can lead to intestinal inflammatory diseases and obesity. Now in Chapter 24 we see
how the microbiome trains the immune system and, in
turn, how the immune system shapes our microbiome. But
first we must discuss the gut immune system, where the
training and shaping take place.
As described in Chapter 23, the intestinal epithelial
barrier is one cell thick and composed mainly of columnar
epithelial cells [Fig. 24.28, step 1, intestinal epithelial
cells (IECs)] and goblet cells (step 2). Goblet cells secrete

■

Cytoskeleton alterations. A second class of toxins can
stimulate either actin polymerization or actin depolymerization. For example, Vibrio cholerae RTX toxin
depolymerizes actin by cross-linking actin fibers. Modifying actin polymerization can alter cell shape or cause
cell membranes to wrap around the pathogen, inviting
the organism into the cytoplasm.

Protein synthesis disruption. A third class, exemplified by diphtheria and Shiga toxins, targets eukaryotic
ribosomes and destroys protein synthesis (Fig. 25.15B).

cytolethal distending toxin, or CLDT) or stimulate
(Pasteurella multocida toxin) host cell division.

Signal transduction disruption. The fifth type of toxin
subverts host cell second messenger pathways. Cholera
toxin and E. coli ST (stable toxin), for instance, cause
runaway synthesis of cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP; described later) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (Fig. 25.15C), respectively, in target
cells. Elevated cAMP or cGMP levels, in turn, trigger
critical changes in ion transport and fluid movement.

■

Vesicle traffic. The major toxin in this class (VacA of
Helicobacter pylori) actually has several modes of action,
depending on the host cell. The most visually striking
effect is its ability to cause vacuolization, which is the
fusion of numerous intracellular vesicles.

■

Exocytosis. The eighth class of exotoxin includes two
protease toxins that alter the movement of nerve cell
cytoplasmic vesicles to membranes where they release
neurotransmitters. One example is tetanus toxin, which
cleaves host proteins required for exocytosis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).

■

Superantigens. Members of the ninth and last class of
toxins activate the immune system without being processed by antigen-presenting cells (discussed in Section 24.3). The pyrogenic (fever-producing) toxins of
Staphylococcus aureus (such as toxic shock syndrome
toxin, TSST) and Streptococcus pyogenes are examples of
superantigen toxins.

Mechanisms of selected exotoxins are described in the
following sections. We focus on toxins that disrupt membranes and a set of exotoxins collectively called AB subunit exotoxins that target either protein synthesis or

CHAPTER 25

signal transduction. Superantigens were described in Section 24.3, and exotoxins that affect exocytosis (tetanus and
botulism toxins) will be discussed in Section 26.7.

Membrane Disruption

Toxins that disrupt membranes include pore-forming proteins that bind cholesterol and insert themselves into target
membranes, and phospholipases that hydrolyze membrane
phospholipids into fatty acids. General descriptive terms
for these toxins are hemolysins, which lyse red blood cells
(but other cells as well), and leukocidins, which more specifically lyse white blood cells. One example is streptolysin
O produced by Streptococcus pyogenes. This pathogen can
cause pharyngitis (sore throat) and necrotizing fasciitis,
also known as “flesh-eating” disease.
Pore-forming toxins. A classic example of a pore-forming exo-

toxin is the hemolytic alpha toxin produced by Staphylococcus
aureus, an organism that causes boils and blood infections.
Alpha toxin forms a transmembrane, oligomeric (sevenmember) beta barrel pore in target cell plasma membranes.
It is easy to see how the resulting leakage of cell constituents and influx of fluid cause the target cell to burst. To form
the pore, hydrophobic areas of each monomer face the lipids of the membrane, and hydrophilic residues face the channel interior. A completed pore and a cutaway view exposing
the channel are illustrated in Figure 25.16A and B. Diagnostic microbiology laboratories visualize hemolysins such as
alpha toxin by inoculating bacteria onto agar plates containing
sheep red blood cells (Fig. 25.16C). The clear, yellow zones
around the S. aureus colonies growing on blood agar indicate
that the microbe secretes a hemolysin. A particularly potent

by most strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
Phospholipase toxins. Phospholipase C of Clostridium

perfringens, a cause of gas gangrene, cleaves phosphatidylcholine in host plasma membranes. At high concentrations
the toxin causes membrane disruption, but at sublethal
concentrations the exotoxin will generate signaling molecules from membrane lipids that can activate cytokine
production. Some phospholipases, also called lecithinases,
can increase the permeability of capillaries to cause edema
(fluid accumulation in tissues).
Escaping vacuoles. Other membrane-disrupting exotox-

ins specifically target vacuolar membranes. Many bacterial
pathogens enter eukaryotic host cells by inducing phagocytosis and then end up in a phagosome vacuole. Some of these
intracellular pathogens need to break out of the phagosome
to grow in the cytoplasm. One example is Listeria monocytogenes, a gastrointestinal pathogen that can also cause
meningitis (described later). This Gram-positive rod uses listeriolysin (a pore-forming exotoxin) and two phospholipases
to escape the phagosome to grow in the cytoplasm.

Two-Subunit AB Exotoxins

As noted earlier, exotoxins target a variety of different host
mechanisms. But despite the diversity of their targets, many
exotoxins share a common structural theme; they have two
subunits, usually called A and B. These two-subunit complexes are called AB exotoxins. The actual toxic activity in
AB exotoxins resides within the A subunit. The role of the B
subunit is to bind host cell receptors. Thus, the B subunit for

watery stools, or diarrhea (Fig. 25.19, step 6).

Thought Question

25.2 Figure 25.19 illustrates how cholera toxin works to
cause diarrhea. To develop a vaccine that generates protective
antibodies, which subunit of cholera toxin should be used to
best protect a person from the toxin’s effects?

How is diarrhea a benefit to the microorganism? The
more diarrhea is produced and expelled, the more organisms
are made and disseminated throughout the environment.
In this way, diarrhea increases the chance that another host
will ingest the organism, ensuring survival of the species.
Diarrhea can also benefit a pathogen by decreasing competition with other organisms as they are swept away. In fact,
the vast majority of organisms found in the diarrheal fluids
of cholera patients are V. cholerae bacteria.
Different pathogens have discovered alternative ways to
alter host cAMP levels. The Gram-negative pathogen Bordetella pertussis causes a childhood respiratory infection called
whooping cough, so named for the whooping sound made
as a child tries to take a breath after a fit of coughing. This
microbe also secretes an ADP-ribosylating toxin, but this
toxin modifies Gi (the inhibitory factor that normally downregulates adenylate cyclase activity). ADP-ribosylation in
this instance prevents that inhibition, with the result (again)
of runaway cAMP synthesis. Pertussis toxin, however, is
structurally different from cholera toxin. In addition, the
organism makes a “stealth” adenylate cyclase that is secreted
from the bacterium but remains inactive until it enters host
cells, where it becomes active by binding the calcium-binding protein calmodulin. The resulting increase in cAMP
levels causes inappropriate triggering of certain host cell signaling pathways and damages lung cells.
Anthrax. A century ago, anthrax (caused by Bacillus

anthracis; Fig. 25.20A) was mainly a disease of cattle
and sheep. Humans acquired the disease only accidentally. Today we fear the deliberate shipment of B. anthracis
through the mail (as happened in 2001) or its dispersion
from the air ducts of heavily populated buildings. What
makes this Gram-positive, spore-forming microbe so dangerous? In large part, its lethality is due to the secretion
of a plasmid-encoded tripartite toxin (a variant of the AB
exotoxin theme). The core subunit of the toxin is called
protective antigen (PA) because immunity to this protein
protects hosts from disease. Protective antigen is made as a
single peptide but then binds to the host cell surface (there
are multiple receptors), where a human protease cleaves off
a fragment (Fig. 25.20B). The remaining part of PA can

self-assemble in the membrane to form heptameric (sevenmembered) and octomeric (eight-membered) pores. The
other two components of anthrax toxin—edema factor
(EF) and lethal factor (LF)—bind to the PA rings and are
carried into the cell (Fig. 25.20C). The complex is endocytosed, and the two proteins carried in are passed through
the pore into the host cytoplasm. Proton motive force
helps unfold the exotoxins and translocates them across
the endocytic membrane. PA is the B subunit for anthrax
toxin, while EF and LF represent different A subunits.
Edema factor and lethal factor are the toxic parts of
anthrax toxin. Both are enzymes that attack the signaling
functions of the cell. Edema factor is an adenylate cyclase
that remains inactive until entering the cytoplasm, where it
binds calmodulin. This binding activates adenylate cyclase,
resulting in a huge production of cAMP, and inactivates
calmodulin from its normal function in the cell.
Lethal factor is actually a protease that cleaves several
host protein kinase kinases, each of which is part of a critical
regulatory cascade affecting cell growth and proliferation.
A protein kinase kinase is an enzyme that phosphorylates,
and thereby activates, another protein kinase that can then
phosphorylate one or more subsequent target proteins. One
consequence of subverting these phosphorylation cascades
is a failure to produce signals that recruit immune cells to
fight the infection.
Thought Question

25.3 How might you experimentally determine whether a
pathogen secretes an exotoxin? (Hint: You can learn more
about how new toxins are found in eTopic 25.8.)

AB Exotoxins That Target
Protein Synthesis
Shiga toxin: Shigella and E. coli O157:H7. Shigella dysente-

riae and E. coli O157:H7 (also known as enterohemorrhagic
E. coli) cause food-borne diseases whose symptoms include
bloody diarrhea. These organisms produce an important
toxin known as Shiga toxin (or Shiga-like toxin). The gene
(stx) encoding Shiga toxin is part of a phage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome. The toxin has five B
subunits for binding and one A subunit imbued with toxic
activity. The A subunit, upon entry, destroys protein synthesis by cleaving 28S rRNA in eukaryotic ribosomes. Strains
that produce high levels of this toxin are associated with
acute kidney failure, known as hemolytic uremic syndrome.

Note:

Shigella dysenteriae is the only Shigella species that
produces Shiga toxin.

E. coli O157:H7 is a recently emerged pathogen. The
organism can colonize cattle intestines without causing
bovine disease; as a result, undetected bacteria can easily contaminate meat products following slaughter, as well as irrigation water from farms (see Chapter 28). The first large U.S.
outbreak of O157:H7 disease was associated with fast-food
hamburgers at a Washington State Jack in the Box restaurant in 1993. Both E. coli and Shigella have remarkable acid
resistance mechanisms that rival that of the gastric pathogen
Helicobacter pylori. This acid resistance makes these pathogens infectious at a very low infectious dose.
What activates stx expression? Iron availability is a key
factor for inducing the expression of stx and many other
virulence genes in pathogens. The body holds its iron
tightly in proteins such as lactoferrin and transferrin. To an

invading organism, the body is a very iron-poor environment. In the presence of low iron, expression of Shiga toxin
increases, the toxin kills host cells, and dead cells release
their iron. Shiga toxin, then, offers a way to rob the host of
its iron stores.
An intriguing question often pondered by scientists is,
What roles do virulence factors play in the natural ecology
of these bacteria? Surely, factors such as Shiga toxin did
not evolve after Shigella started infecting humans. William
Lainhart, Gino Stolfa, and Gerald Koudelka from the State
University of New York at Buffalo discovered that Shiga
toxin is actually a natural defense against Tetrahymena
thermophila, a ciliated protist that grazes on bacteria. Lainhart and his colleagues found that Tetrahymena was killed
when cocultured with Shiga toxin–producing bacteria.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

They proposed that reactive oxygen species produced by
Tetrahymena induce the SOS response in Shigella, which
then activates phage replication and the expression of stx
(SOS induction is discussed in Section 9.4). This is another
example of altruistic behavior by members of a bacterial
species in which some individuals sacrifice themselves (as
a result of phage lysis) to save the population. For further
discussion of the beneficial roles of viruses, see Chapter 6.

used to try to tame the human host. A discussion of how
new microbial toxins are discovered is found in eTopic 25.8.
Thought Question

25.5 Use an Internet search engine to determine which

other toxins are related to the cholera toxin A subunit. (Hint:
Start by searching on “protein” at PubMed to find the protein
sequence; then use a BLAST program.)

Diphtheria toxin. The classic example of an exotoxin that

targets protein synthesis is diphtheria toxin, produced by
Corynebacterium diphtheriae, the cause of the respiratory
disease diphtheria. The two-component diphtheria exotoxin, discussed more fully in eTopic 25.7, kills cells by
ADP-ribosylating eukaryotic protein synthesis elongation
factor 2 (EF2). The vaccine used to prevent diphtheria (the
“D” in DTaP) is an inactivated form of this exotoxin (see
Section 24.7). C. diphtheriae is another example of a pathogen whose toxin gene (dtx) is regulated by iron availability
and is part of a prophage genome integrated into the bacterial chromosome. Recall that a prophage is phage genome
that has integrated into a bacterial chromosome.

Thought Question

25.4 Would patients with iron overload (excess free iron in
the blood) be more susceptible to infection?

We have examined only a few of the many protein exotoxins employed by pathogens. Some of the others, including tetanus and botulism toxins, will be described in the
next chapter. What should be apparent from our brief sampling is the evolutionary ingenuity that pathogens have
A. LPS membrane

Endotoxin (LPS) Is Made Only
by Gram-Negative Bacteria

Another important virulence factor common to all Gramnegative microorganisms is endotoxin present in the outer
membrane (discussed in Chapter 3). Not to be confused
with secreted exotoxins, endotoxin is an embedded part of
the bacterial cell surface and an important contributor to disease. Endotoxin, otherwise called lipopolysaccharide (LPS),
is composed of lipid A, core glycolipid, and a repeating
polysaccharide chain known as the O antigen (Fig. 25.21).
LPS molecules form the outer leaflet of the Gram-negative
outer membrane (discussed in Chapter 3). As bacteria die,
they release endotoxin. Endotoxin is a microbe-associated
molecular pattern (MAMP) molecule that can bind to certain Toll-like receptors on macrophages or B cells and trigger the release of TNF-alpha, interferon, IL-1, and other
cytokines (MAMPs, Toll-like receptors, and cytokines are
discussed in Chapters 23 and 24). The release of these active
agents causes a variety of symptoms, such as:

The major differences between exotoxins and endotoxins

Note:

Lipopolysaccharide O antigens forming part of the outer
membrane are used to classify different strains of E. coli (for example, E. coli O157 versus E. coli O111), as well as other Gram-negative
organisms.

The role of endotoxin can be seen in infections with
the Gram-negative diplococcus Neisseria meningitidis
(Fig. 25.22A), a major cause of bacterial meningitis. N. meningitidis has, as part of its pathogenesis, a septicemic phase
in which the organism can replicate to high numbers in the
bloodstream. The large amount of endotoxin present causes
a massive depletion of clotting factors, which leads to internal
bleeding, most prominently displayed to a physician as small
pinpoint hemorrhages called petechiae on the patient’s hands
and feet (Fig. 25.22B). Capillary bleeding near the surface
of the skin causes petechiae. One danger of treating massive
Gram-negative sepsis with antibiotics is that the enormous
release of endotoxin from dead bacteria could well kill the

patient. Untreated Gram-negative sepsis is, however, almost
always fatal, so its treatment, albeit risky, is imperative.
An approach to prevent endotoxic shock currently under
study is based on the knowledge that LPS must bind to Tolllike receptor TLR4 to cause endotoxic shock. What if we could
neutralize TLR4 by antibody and prevent it from binding LPS
during an infection? Several investigators have shown that
injecting antibody raised to TLR4 (anti-TLR4) into infected
mice will successfully block TLR4 receptors and protect the
mice from E. coli–induced septic shock. Unfortunately, this
approach has not yet proved successful in human trials.

To Summarize
There are nine categories of protein exotoxins based
on mode of action. These include toxins that disrupt
membranes, inhibit protein synthesis, or alter the synthesis of host cell signaling-molecules, as well as toxins
that are superantigens or target-specific proteases.

■

Many bacterial toxins are two-component, AB subunit
toxins. The B subunit promotes penetration through host
cell membranes, whereas the A subunit has toxic activity.

■

Staphylococcus aureus alpha toxin forms pores in host
cell membranes.

■

Cholera toxin, E. coli labile toxin, and pertussis toxin
are AB toxins that alter host cAMP production by adding ADP-ribose groups to different G-factor proteins.

■

Shiga toxin is an AB toxin that cleaves host cell 28S
rRNA in host cell ribosomes.

■

Anthrax toxin is a three-part AB toxin with one B subunit (protective antigen) and two different A subunits
that affect cAMP levels (edema factor) and cleave host
protein kinases (lethal factor).

■

■

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), known as endotoxin, is an
integral component of Gram-negative outer membranes
and an important virulence factor that triggers massive
release of cytokines from host cells. The indiscriminate
release of cytokines can trigger fever, shock, and death.

25.5

Deploying Toxins
and Effectors

A recurring theme among bacterial pathogens is the secretion of proteins that destroy, cripple, or subvert host target cells. The bacterial toxins described in Section 25.4
are secreted into the surrounding environment, where
they float randomly until chance intervenes and they hit a
membrane-binding site. However, many pathogens attach
to tissue cells and inject bacterial proteins (called effectors)
directly into the host cell cytoplasm. The proteins may not
kill the cell, but they redirect host signaling pathways in
ways that benefit the microbe.
Protein secretion pathways were introduced in Section 8.5, focusing on ATP-binding cassette (ABC) proteins
as a model. Additional secretion models are described here
in their critical role of delivering pathogenicity proteins
such as toxins. A particularly interesting aspect of these
secretory systems is that many of them evolved from, and
bear structural resemblance to, other cell structures that
serve fundamental cell functions. The molecular processes
that are evolutionarily related to secretion include:
■

Type IV pilus biogenesis (homologous to type II protein
secretion)

■

Flagellar synthesis (homologous to type III protein
secretion)

■

Conjugation (homologous to type IV protein secretion)

Table 25.5 lists features of the seven export systems of
Gram-negative bacteria and examples of associated virulence effector proteins. Secretion system types II, III, and
IV will be described in more detail.

Type II Secretion Resembles
Type IV Pilus Assembly

Cholera toxin, discussed in Section 25.4, is a well-known
example of a toxin secreted by a type II secretion system.
Type II secretion offers a clear example of how nature has
modified the blueprints of one system to do a very different task. DNA sequence analysis has revealed that the genes
used for type IV pilus biogenesis (see Section 25.3) were
duplicated at some point during evolution and redesigned
to serve as a protein secretion mechanism. Type IV pili have
the unusual ability to extend and retract from the outer
membrane—a property that produces the gliding motility
of Myxococcus (see Section 4.6) and the twitching motility of Neisseria and Pseudomonas. As you might guess,
assembly/disassembly of these appendages is quite complex.
Type II protein secretion mechanisms mirror this complexity. Proteins to be secreted first make their way, via the
SecA-dependent general secretion pathway, to the periplasm, where they are folded and then encounter the appropriate type II secretion system. Type II secretion systems
cyclically assemble and disassemble the pilus-like structure,
using it as a piston to ram folded toxins or effector proteins
through an outer membrane pore structure and into the
surrounding void (Fig. 25.23).

Type III Secretion Injects Effector
Proteins into Host Cells

Yersinia, Salmonella, and Shigella are the etiological agents
of Black Death and various forms of diarrhea. In the 1990s
it was discovered that these organisms could somehow take
the bacterial virulence proteins made in their cytoplasm and
drive them directly into the eukaryotic cell cytoplasm without the protein ever getting into the extracellular environment. Direct delivery is a good idea because it eliminates the
dilution that happens when a toxin is secreted into media.
Another advantage of this strategy is that it avoids the need
to tailor the toxin to fit a preexisting host receptor.
What kind of molecular machine can directly deliver
cytoplasmic bacterial proteins into target cells? Some
microbes use tiny molecular syringes embedded in their
membranes to inject proteins directly into the host cytoplasm; this mechanism of delivery is called a type III
secretion system (T3SS). Figure 25.24
shows electron
micrographs of type III secretion needles and a model of
the complex. Genes encoding type III systems are actually

related to flagellar genes, whose products export the flagellin proteins through the center of a growing flagellum
(discussed in Section 3.6). It appears that flagellar genes
were evolutionarily reengineered to encode proteins that
act more like molecular syringes (Fig. 25.24C).
The bacterial virulence proteins secreted by type III systems subvert normal host cell signaling pathways, some of
which cause dramatic rearrangements of host cytoskeleton
at the cell membrane that lead to engulfment of the microbe
(Fig. 25.25). The genes encoding type III systems are usually located within pathogenicity islands inherited from
other microbial sources. Many bacterial pathogens use this
type of secretion system, including plant pathogens such
as Pseudomonas syringae (the cause of blight, a disease of
many plants in which leaves or stems develop brown spots).
Secretion is normally triggered by cell-cell contact between
host and bacterium.
E. coli pathogens use a T3SS to “inject” their own
receptor into host cells. Enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC)

and enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) are two diarrheaproducing forms of E. coli. These pathogens use pili to initially bind to the host’s intestinal epithelial cells; however,
the bacterium must establish a more intimate attachment to
these cells to cause disease. The bacterial outer membrane

protein called intimin mediates this intimate attachment.
The only problem is that the host lacks a receptor for intimin. No problem. EPEC and EHEC use a type III secretion
system to insert their own receptor, Tir (for translocated
intimin receptor), into the target cells. (Fig. 25.26A). Brett
Finlay and his colleagues in Vancouver, British Columbia,
discovered this system and found that the genes encoding
intimin, Tir, and the secretion apparatus are all part of an
EPEC pathogenicity island.
Once injected and placed in the host membrane, Tir
binds intimin on the bacterial surface (Fig. 25.26B).
Think of Tir as a wall anchor you poke into a board in
order to attach something to it. The result is a tighter, more
intimate adherence between the bacterium and host cell
surface, which is required for infection to proceed. In addition, host protein kinases phosphorylate Tir at tyrosine residue 474. Phosphorylated Tir directly triggers a remarkable
reorganization of host cellular cytoskeletal components
(actin, alpha-actinin, ezrin, talin, and myosin light chain)
such that a membrane “pedestal” is formed, raising the
microbe up (Fig. 25.26C). The result of this attachment
is the characteristic attaching and effacing (A/E) lesion,

formation. By placing itself on a “pedestal,” EPEC avoids
engulfment and the perils of the phagolysosome.
Salmonella pathogenesis. The Gram-negative bacterium
Salmonella enterica is currently the most common bacterial food-borne pathogen in the United States. Its transmission has been linked to everything from cantaloupe
and peanut butter (in 2012) to poultry (pick any year). As
part of its pathogenesis, Salmonella uses type III secretion systems to invade the eukaryotic host cell and replicate intracellularly. Following ingestion of contaminated
food or water, this bacterium attaches to and invades M
cells that are interspersed along the wall of the small intestine. M cells are specialized intestinal epithelial cells (see
Fig. 23.25B) that sample normal intestinal microbes and
transfer pathogens across the epithelial barrier for recognition by the immune system. Salmonella subverts the
normal function of M cells and causes an inflammatory
response that leads to diarrhea.
During its evolutionary journey toward becoming a
pathogen, Salmonella has acquired as many as 14 pathogenicity islands. Five of those islands can be found in all
S. enterica serovars, but only two will be discussed here.
Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) encodes a type
III protein secretion system that delivers a cocktail of at
least 13 different protein toxins (called effector proteins)
directly into the cytosol of host epithelial cells in the gut
(Fig. 25.27A, step 1). Inside epithelial cells, these effector proteins interfere with signal transduction cascades and

modulate the host response. One mission of these effectors
is to induce cytoskeletal actin rearrangements that cause
ruffling of the eukaryotic membrane around the microbe
(step 2; also see Fig. 25.25). The membrane ruffling
starts the process of engulfment. Salmonella induces this
response as a way to avoid the normal endocytic process.
While engulfment is under way, some SPI-1 effectors act
to loosen tight junctions that hold together adjacent epithelial cells (Fig. 25.27A, step 3). Uncontrolled chloride secretion (triggered by another effector) produces diarrhea as
water leaves infected cells to compensate for an electrolyte
imbalance. Other SPI-1 effectors activate transcription pathways that alter cytokine expression (step 4). One of the cytokines made, IL-8, helps lure phagocytic neutrophils (PMNs)
to the area of infection, which initiates inflammation (step 5).
Initiating inflammation may seem counterintuitive, but
Salmonella’s strategy is to employ the neutrophils as “mercenaries” to kill competitors among the microbiota. The
neutrophils squeeze between epithelial cells to reach the
gut lumen, where they begin to engulf microbiota and produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of their oxidative burst (see Chapter 23). Besides killing competitors, the
oxidative burst converts thiosulfate, a compound made by
gut microbiota, into tetrathionate which Salmonella, but
not its competitors, can use as an alternative electron acceptor (Fig. 25.27A, step 6). Tetrathionate provides a competitive advantage to Salmonella growing in the lumen.
Once Salmonella enters an epithelial cell or a macrophage,
it finds itself in a vacuole called the Salmonella-containing
vacuole, or SCV (Fig. 25.27B, step 1). In the normal course

of events, an enzyme-packed lysosome would fuse with the phagosome
and release its contents in an effort
to kill the invader. Salmonella, however, possesses a second pathogenicity
island, called SPI-2, which subverts
this host response. SPI-2 uses another
type III secretion system to inject
proteins that alter vesicle remodeling
(step 2) and vesicle trafficking (step
3), thereby reducing phagosomelysosome fusion so that the intracellular bacteria are spared.
Some SPI-2 effectors downregulate production of IL-8 and
TNF-alpha to limit inflammation;
other effectors inhibit migration of
dendritic cells, which will subvert antigen presentation (Fig. 25.27B, step
4). Salmonella eventually escapes from
the initial host cell when the SCV
traffics to the cell periphery and fuses
with the host membrane. In addition,
some SPI-2 effectors will trigger host
cell apoptosis (step 5), a programmed
cell death that kills the host cell in a
way that prevents further inflammation. Freed from the initial cell, Salmonella can now infect other cells,
including macrophages.
Because of their importance to
virulence, type III secretion systems
are the subject of intensive research
designed to exploit them as potential
drug targets.

Type IV Secretion
Resembles Conjugation
Systems

Many bacteria can transfer DNA
from donor to recipient cells via a
cell-cell contact system known as
conjugation (see Section 9.1). The
conjugation systems of some pathogens have been modified, through
evolution, into new systems that

The bacterium that causes whooping cough in humans,
Bordetella pertussis, also uses a type IV secretion system,
to export pertussis toxin, but it simply exports the toxin,
without injecting it into the host (Fig. 25.28). Type IV
systems also differ with respect to whether the protein is
taken directly from the cytoplasm, like CagA from Helicobacter, or from the periplasm, as with pertussis toxin. In
the latter case, the SecA-dependent general secretory system first delivers the toxin to the periplasmic space.
Another unique toxin delivery system, type VI secretion,
resembles a harpoon or blowgun (see Special Topic 25.1).

Many pathogens use specific protein secretion pathways to deliver toxins.
Type II secretion systems use a pilus-like extraction/
retraction mechanism to push proteins out of the cell.
Type III secretion uses a molecular syringe to inject proteins from the bacterial cytoplasm into the host cytoplasm.
Type IV secretion utilizes a group of proteins homologous to conjugation machinery to secrete proteins from
either the cytoplasm or the periplasm.

Surviving within the Host

Once inside a host, how does a successful pathogen avoid
detection and destruction? Many of the virulence factors in the pathogen’s arsenal help the microbe escape or
resist innate immune mechanisms. Others are dedicated
to stealth—that is, hiding from the immune system. But
before discussing how these organisms survive in a host, we
must ask how the pathogen knows it is in a host.

Where Am I?

A pathogen that can grow either outside or inside a host
must adjust its physiology to match its whereabouts. Why
make a type III secretion system if there are no host cells
around? But how do microbial pathogens know whether
they are in a host or in a pond? And which bacterial genes
are expressed exclusively while in a host?

Type IV secretion of pertussis toxin.

Evolutionarily related to conjugation systems, this type IV system in
Bordetella pertussis takes pertussis toxin from the periplasm (moved
there by SecA-dependent transport) across the outer membrane.

The same types of regulatory mechanisms that sense
environmental conditions in a pond are used by the microbe
to intuit its whereabouts in a host. That is, various sensing systems act in concert to recognize a specific environmental niche. Two-component signal transduction systems,
discussed in Section 10.1, are used to monitor magnesium
concentrations, which are characteristically low in a host
cell vacuole. Other regulators measure pH, which will be
low (acidic) in the same vacuole. The point is that there is
no single in vivo sensor system. The various regulators collaborate to trigger the expression of virulence genes.
Enterohemorrhagic E. coli uses positive and negative signals to determine where in a host it should express virulence
genes. As mentioned earlier, EHEC uses a T3SS to inject
effector proteins into gastrointestinal cells, so synthesis of
the T3SS apparatus is best induced only in the intestine. One
signal that induces T3SS synthesis is fucose. Fucose ends
up in the intestine because fucosidases from the nonpathogenic gut microbe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron cleave fucose
from the host glycans present on intestinal epithelial cells.
EHEC senses the fucose via a two-component system and
responds by synthesizing the T3SS. However, other metabolites in the host can inhibit expression of the T3SS apparatus

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

SPECIAL TOPIC 25.1- - Type VI Secretion: Poison Darts
Pygmies living in Central Africa and the Yagua from Peru
both use an ancient weapon for hunting—namely, blowguns.
Blowguns are carefully crafted, hollowed-out tubes designed
to shoot curare-tipped poison darts that can penetrate and
paralyze animal prey. What do blowguns and microbes have in
common? Many Gram-negative microbes, such as E coli, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas, and Burkholderia, make incredible blowgun-like devices that deliver either virulence proteins
to eukaryotic prey, or antimicrobials into bacterial competitors to kill them.
These molecular weapons, called type VI secretion systems (T6SSs), comprise at least 13 proteins and are present
in at least one copy in about 25% of all sequenced Gramnegative bacteria. The genomes of some bacteria, such as
Burkholderia, carry five or six distinct T6SS gene clusters.
Structure and function. The components of T6SSs appear
to be repurposed phage tail parts normally used to deliver
phage DNA into bacterial host cells (see Fig. 6.11A). VipA/B
proteins of V. cholerae T6SS, and their orthologs in other species, are homologous to the phage T4 tail sheath, a structure
that contracts and drives the T4 needlelike core through the
host cell wall. T4 DNA is delivered through the core and into
the cytoplasm. Hcp proteins of T6SSs are homologs of the
phage T4 needle proteins, while VgrG proteins are structural

A.

homologs of the T4 spike complex that sits atop the T4 core.
The T4 spike complex initially punctures the target bacterial
cell surface. T6SSs actually resemble an inverted phage tail
inside a bacterial cell. T6SSs translocate substrates from one
cell directly into a target cell only after physical contact with
the target.
Bacterial T6SSs kill or maim by translocating (firing) toxic
effector molecules into bacterial competitors or into eukaryotic target cells. But do they actually fire like phage tails?
Grant Jensen (California Institute of Technology; Fig. 1A) and
John Mekalanos (Harvard University; Fig. 1B) wanted to find
out.
The team and their colleagues used time-lapse fluorescence light microscopy to visually track what happens to a
Vibrio cholerae T6SS sheath tagged with green fluorescent
protein (VipA-GFP). As shown in Figure 1C, the sheaths of
the type VI secretion system cycled from assembly to quick
contraction to disassembly and then reassembly. Real-time
video of this cycling can be seen at the links provided in the
supplementary data of the paper cited at the end of this Special Topic.
When examined using cryo-EM imaging, T6SS appeared as
straight, intracellular tubular structures aligned perpendicular
to the cytoplasmic membrane. One structure was long, thin,
and stretched almost the entire width of the cell. The second

form was shorter, wider, and appeared contracted. The
researchers concluded that these structures corresponded
to what was seen expanding and contracting in the fluorescent microscopic study. They further suggested that the rapid
contraction (firing) of the type VI secretion system sheath
provides the energy needed to shoot proteins out of the
bacterium and into an adjacent target cell.
After being fired, the VipA/B sheath and Hcp core proteins
are depolymerized by another T6SS gene product, called
ClpV, a type of chaperone. The authors of the study propose
that the disassembled Hcp and VipA/B monomers and dimers
are reused to assemble a new microbial “blowgun.” The model
for T6SS assembly (loading), extension (ready to fire), contraction (firing), and disassembly is illustrated in Figure 2.
Secretion. What do type VI secretion systems secrete? When
engaged with eukaryotic cells, VgrG proteins appear to be the
main effector, although some effectors can bind to VgrG and
hitchhike into the target cell. VgrG proteins carry extended
C-terminal regions that function in the eukaryotic host cell

cytoplasm. For example, the C-terminal extension of Vibrio
cholerae VgrG1 carries an RtxA toxin domain that, after being
fired into target cells, cross-links actin. VgrG1 from Aeromonas hydrophila induces host cell toxicity by ADP-ribosylating
host cell actin, which ultimately triggers apoptotic cell death.
Depending on the pathogen, T6SS-mediated phenotypes
include aspects of adhesion, internalization, cytoskeletal rearrangements, cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, and giant-cell formation (Fig. 3).
In addition to delivering VgrG effector “darts” into eukaryotic cells, the T6SSs have been characterized as mediators of
competitive interbacterial interactions. The only antimicrobial T6SS effector characterized to date is the Pseudomonas
aeruginosa protein Tse2, which appears to be the toxin component of a toxin immunity system (see eTopic 10.4). Bacterial cells lacking Tsi2, the cognate immunity protein to Tse2,
suffer arrested growth when Tse2 is expressed intracellularly.
Some organisms can also sense when they are under attack
by another T6SS. Pseudomonas, for instance, can detect a
T6SS assault from Vibrio cholerae and assemble a retaliatory

T6SS at the very point of attack. Pseudomonas somehow
survives the Vibrio attack and launches a counterstrike that
kills the Vibrio. How Pseudomonas senses the attack is still
unclear.
With its role in virulence, its prevalence among Gramnegative bacterial genomes, and its predicted phage-like
structure, the type VI secretion system has become an
exciting area of research. Identification of pathogenspecific T6SS components and substrates may reveal
novel targets for treating bacterial disease.

RESEARCH QUESTION
Before searching for, or designing, a potential antimicrobial that would target one of the T6SS components, what
experiment(s) could you do to determine whether a single
antimicrobial compound could potentially target T6SS
from many different organisms?

in unfavorable body sites. Andrew Roe and his team at the
University of Glasgow found that the host metabolite D-serine can inhibit EHEC T3SS expression. D-Serine is found
at high concentrations at extraintestinal sites such as the urinary tract and brain, two sites that EHEC does not infect.
How D-serine inhibits T3SS gene expression is not clear.
Many bacterial pathogens will sense the concentration
of free iron, which is typically very low in the host, to regulate virulence genes. For instance, Corynebacterium diphtheriae sensing a low iron environment will induce synthesis of
diphtheria toxin (see eTopic 25.7; Figure 7.2). The toxin kills
host cells to release their iron, which the bacteria can now use.
For other pathogens, iron concentration alone is usually not
enough to provoke virulence. Regulators sensitive to other in
vivo signals must be activated to achieve a successful infection.
Cell-cell communication is also important during infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, for example, has at least two
quorum-sensing systems that detect secreted autoinducers.
As the number of bacteria in a given space increases, so, too,
does the concentration of the chemical autoinducer. When
the autoinducer reaches a critical concentration, it diffuses

back into the bacterium or binds to a surface receptor and
triggers the expression of bacterial target genes. Genes
included in the P. aeruginosa quorum-sensing regulons
encode Pseudomonas exotoxin A and other secreted proteins, such as elastase, phospholipase, and alkaline protease.
Why would a pathogen employ quorum sensing to regulate virulence factors? One reason may be to prevent alerting
the host that it is under attack before enough microbes can
accumulate through replication. Tripping the host’s alarms
too early would make eliminating infection easy. Waiting
until a large number of bacteria have amassed before releasing toxins and proteases will increase the chance that the
host can be overwhelmed.

Extracellular Immune Avoidance

This topic was first covered in the discussions of host defense
(Chapter 23) and immunology (Chapter 24). Many bacteria,
such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis,
produce a thick polysaccharide capsule that envelops the cell.
Capsules help organisms resist phagocytosis in several ways.

CHAPTER 25

Recall that phagocytes must recognize bacterial cell-surface
structures or surface-bound C3b complement factor to begin
phagocytosis (see Section 23.6). A capsule will cover bacterial cell wall components and mannose-containing carbohydrates that phagocytes normally use for attachment. The
uniformity and slippery nature of capsule composition make
it difficult for phagocytes to lock on to the bacterial cell.
But what about complement factor C3b, which can bind
to the bacterial cell? Phagocytes have surface C3b receptors
that latch on to C3b molecules. Capsules will envelop any
C3b complement factor that binds to the bacterial surface,
thereby hiding it from the phagocyte. Fortunately, immune
defense mechanisms can eventually circumvent this avoidance strategy by producing opsonizing antibodies (IgG)
against the capsule itself (see Section 24.2). The Fc regions
of antibodies that bind to the capsule point away from the
bacterium, so they are free to bind Fc receptors on phagocyte membranes. Binding of the Fc region to the phagocyte’s Fc receptor triggers phagocytosis.
Pathogens can also use proteins on the cell surface to
avoid phagocytosis. Staphylococcus aureus has a cell wall protein called protein A that binds to the Fc region of antibodies, hiding the bacteria from phagocytes. This works in two
ways. Protein A can bind to the Fc region of any antibody
before the antibody-binding site ever finds its bacterial target.
Thus, the business end of the antibody—that is, the part with
antigen-binding sites—is pointing away from the microbe.
However, even if the antibody finds its antigen target on one
bacterium, protein A from a second bacterium can bind to
that Fc region, once again blocking phagocyte recognition.
Some microbes can trigger apoptosis in target host cells.
Proteins made by the pathogen enter the host cell and trigger this programmed cell death. How does this help the
pathogen? If a macrophage is targeted for self-destruction,
it cannot destroy the microbe.
Another immune avoidance strategy used by microorganisms, both the extracellular and intracellular types, is to
change their antigenic structure. Genes encoding flagella,
pili, and other surface proteins often use site-specific gene
inversions to express alternative proteins (for example, Salmonella phase variation) or slipped-strand mispairing (see
eTopic 10.1) to add or remove amino acids from a sequence
(see Section 10.1). You can think of these processes as
shape-shifting to avoid recognition.

Intracellular Pathogens

In an effort to escape both innate and humoral immune
mechanisms (see Chapters 23 and 24), many bacterial
pathogens, called intracellular pathogens, seek refuge by
invading host cells. (Viruses, of course, are, by definition,
intracellular pathogens.) Hiding within a host cell temporarily provides the pathogen safe harbor from antibodies

and phagocytic cells. Some bacteria dedicate their entire
lifestyle to intracellular parasitism and are called obligate
intracellular pathogens. Rickettsia, for example, for reasons unknown, will not grow outside a living eukaryotic
cell. Other microbes, such as Salmonella and Shigella, are
considered facultative intracellular pathogens because
they can live either inside host cells or free. We have already
discussed how intracellular pathogens get into cells, but
how do they withstand intracellular attempts to kill them?
Once inside the phagosome, intracellular pathogens
have three options to avoid being killed by a phagolysosome (Fig. 25.29). They can escape the phagosome, prevent phagosome-lysosome fusion, or prefer growth inside
the phagolysosome.
Escaping the phagosome. The Gram-negative bacillus Shi-

gella dysenteriae and the Gram-positive bacillus Listeria
monocytogenes, both of which cause food-borne gastrointestinal disease, use hemolysins to break out of the phagosome
vacuole before fusion (described earlier). By escaping the
phagosome, the bacteria completely avoid lysosomal enzymes.
Once free in the cytoplasm, they enjoy unrestricted growth.
Yet even in the cytoplasm, these microbes have found a way
to redirect host cell function to their own ends.
A fascinating aspect of escaping the phagosome involves
motility. Shigella and Listeria are both nonmotile at 37°C
in vitro; however, they both move around inside the host
cell, even though they have no flagella. How do they move?
These species are equipped with a special device at one end
of the cell that mediates host cell actin polymerization. The
polymerizing actin, called a “rocket tail,” propels the organism forward through the cell (Fig. 25.30A) until it reaches
a membrane. The membrane is then pushed into an adjacent cell, where the organism once again ends up in a vacuole (Fig. 25.29, fate 3). This strategy allows the microbe to
spread from cell to cell without ever encountering the extracellular environment, where it would be vulnerable to attack.
Actin motility is also a feature of some species of Rickettsia
(Fig. 25.31), Mycobacterium, and Burkholderia (see Fig. 3 in
Special Topic 25.1).
Inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion. Some intracellular
pathogens avoid lysosomal enzymes by preventing lysosomal
fusion with the phagosome. Salmonella, Mycobacterium,
Legionella, and Chlamydia are good examples. For example,
Legionella pneumophila grows inside alveolar macrophage
phagosomes and produces the potentially fatal Legionnaires’
disease, so named for the veterans group that suffered the first
recognized outbreak, in 1976. The organism, once inside a
phagosome (called a Legionella-containing vacuole, or LCV),
uses a type IV secretion system to secrete proteins through
the vesicle membrane and into the cytoplasm. These bacterial
proteins interfere with the cell signaling pathways that cause

1024

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

phagosome-lysosome fusion. A bacterial protein
called LegC7, for instance, inhibits endosome
trafficking that would lead to lysosome fusion.
The result is that L. pneumophila can grow in
a friendlier vesicle. Interestingly, L. pneumophila is actually a soil and water microbe. Its ability to survive inside macrophages evolved from
its ability to survive in amebas, which serve as a
natural reservoir for this pathogen.
Salmonella Typhi is another pathogen that
prevents phagosome-lysosome fusion, but
this organism eventually leaves the host cell
(exocytosis) and enters extracellular tissue
spaces where macrophages await (Fig. 25.29,
fate 2). The bacterium is once again engulfed,
by a macrophage this time, but again survives inside the macrophage phagosome. The
infected macrophage homes to a regional
lymph node, enters the bloodstream, and,
like a Trojan horse, disseminates Salmonella
throughout the body.

the “bring it on” strategy, some intracellular
pathogens prefer the harsh environment of the
phagolysosome. Coxiella burnetii, for example,
grows well in the very acidic phagolysosome
environment (Fig. 25.30B). This obligate
intracellular organism (an organism that grows
only inside another living cell) causes a flu-like
illness called Q fever (query fever). The symptoms of Q fever include sore throat, muscle
aches, headache, and high fever. The illness has
a mortality rate of about 1%, so most people
recover to good health. The organism allows phagosomelysosome fusion because the acidic environment that results
is needed for it to survive and grow.

Alternative fates of intracellular pathogens.

Different pathogens have different strategies for surviving in a host
cell. Some tolerate phagolysosome fusion (Coxiella), others prevent
phagolysosome fusion (Salmonella), and still others escape the
phagosome to replicate in the cytoplasm (Shigella and Listeria).

Thought Question

25.8 How can you determine whether a bacterium is an
intracellular pathogen?

Why some bacteria are obligate intracellular pathogens
is unclear. One intracellular bacterium, Rickettsia prowazekii, a cause of epidemic typhus, appears to be an “energy

parasite” that can transport ATP from the host cytoplasm
and exchange it for spent ADP in the bacterium’s cytoplasm. But this does not explain its obligate intracellular
status, since giving Rickettsia ATP outside a host does not
allow the bacterium to grow. Other factors remain to be
discovered.

Sleeping with the Enemy

As just described, many bacterial and, of course, viral
pathogens find safe haven by growing inside host cells.
However, from our knowledge of innate and adaptive
immune responses, it is not intuitively obvious why this is
so. After all, infected cells present microbial antigens on

their class I or class II MHC receptors to alert the innate
and adaptive immune systems that the infected host cell
must be killed to resolve the infection. In addition, pieces
of intracellular microbes (flagella, LPS, peptidoglycan) will
bind pattern recognition receptors (TLRs and NLRs) that
activate intracellular inflammasomes. Inflammasomes trigger production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that mediate
inflammation.
So how do intracellular pathogens avoid destruction? It
turns out that these invaders employ a variety of molecular
tricks that misdirect the immune system much as a magician
misdirects an audience. All of these strategies, summarized

in Figure 25.32, are designed to buy the microbe more
time to overwhelm the host.
Molecular mimicry and subverting antigen presentation.

A variety of bacteria and viruses use mimicry to confuse the
immune system (discussed in Section 24.7). In some cases,
microbial proteins are made that look like cytokines or that
bind to host cells and hitchhike via normal host trafficking
to the nucleus, where the bacterial protein interferes with
cytokine gene expression. One example involving Shigella
is discussed in eTopic 25.9. These factors can manipulate

the balance of helper T cells, for example, and send immunity down the wrong path for combating the microbe.
Microbes, especially viruses, can also interfere with
antigen presentation on the surfaces of infected cells.
Recall from Chapter 24 that proteins made by infectious
agents growing in the cytoplasm of a host cell are broken
down in the cytosol and transported into the ER by the
transporter of antigen peptides (TAP). The viral or bacterial antigens are loaded onto MHC I molecules found on
the ER membrane, and the complexes are sent to the cell
surface. Surface MHC I presents those peptide antigens
to roaming CD8 cytotoxic T cells that will then kill the
infected cell. Any scheme that interrupts MHC I presentation will spare the infected cell and its infectious cargo
from destruction. So how do pathogens derail MHC
presentation?
Collectively, pathogens have four basic ways to subvert
antigen presentation: (1) Make proteins that resist digestion by host proteasomes so that antigens are not processed. (2) Make a protein that blocks the TAP protein
so that processed antigens cannot be loaded onto MHC I
(herpes viruses such as HSV, CMV, and VZV are famous
for this approach). (3) Make a protein that induces TAP

(4) Induce degradation of MHC molecules via ubiquitylation. Ubiquitylation strategies that coerce the host to
degrade MHC proteins are described later.
Flipping cytokine profiles. Many pathogens defy death
by growing inside macrophages that are “armed” with
numerous antimicrobial weapons. Pathogens that can
grow inside macrophages include bacteria such as Salmonella, Yersinia, Listeria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis,
Francisella tularensis, and Chlamydia; as well as protozoans such as Leishmania and Trypanosoma cruzi. How do
they survive? These, and many other pathogens, interrupt
host cell signaling pathways designed to activate macrophage antimicrobial mechanisms. To perform this trick,
most intracellular pathogens inhibit production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-12,
and IFN-gamma, but encourage production of antiinflammatory cytokines like IL-10, TGF-beta (transforming growth factor beta), and IL-4.
Mycobacterium, T. cruzi, and Leishmania also down-regulate the expression of host membrane receptors for IFNgamma (thereby inhibiting inflammation), and interfere
with downstream regulators that activate the production
of MHC class I proteins, which dulls host immune mechanisms. Reduced MHC I production means less antigen presentation, fewer activated T H1 helper cells, and, thus, fewer
cytotoxic T cells to attack the infected cell.

Stopping programmed cell death. A macrophage that fails
to eliminate infecting pathogens will eventually give up
and try to kill itself and the infecting pathogens through
one of three programmed-cell-death pathways (apoptosis,
necrosis, or pyroptosis). This is a last resort to clear the
infection. Apoptotic cells maintain membrane integrity
during apoptotic death and are engulfed by nearby phagocytes. Inflammation is not provoked, because cytokines are
not released. In contrast, necrosis and pyroptosis initiate
rapid inflammatory responses by secreting inflammatory
cytokines. All of these mechanisms can kill the intracellular pathogen.
To “keep hope alive” and retain their intracellular niche,
intracellular microbes can prevent host cell suicide by interfering with the molecular signals that initiate host death
programs, or they can activate pro-survival mechanisms.
Some pathogens even synthesize microbial mimics of host
anti-apoptotic proteins. Yersinia enterocolitica and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for instance, prevent pyroptotic cell
death by inhibiting inflammasome formation and caspase-1
activation. Caspase-1 is a protease that initiates pyroptosis.
Herpes viruses (discussed in Chapter 11), which cause
cold sores, genital herpes, mononucleosis, and some cancers, can enter into a latent state. Latency requires shutting down viral replication and integrating viral DNA into
a host genome. But why doesn’t the virus trigger apoptosis in the host cell before becoming latent? Herpes viruses
produce a number of small RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs) that can interfere with the apoptosis program. One such miRNA prevents the translation of two
host cell proteins required for cell death. The miRNAs
bind to regions in the apoptosis mRNAs and promote their
degradation. Once latent, the virus no longer produces any
viral proteins, so the immune system of the infected individual cannot detect the infected cell.
Some intracellular pathogens (Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis) actually tilt macrophage suicide pathways toward apoptosis to promote
pathogen dissemination (recall that apoptotic cells are
engulfed by other phagocytes). Some intracellular pathogens both inhibit and activate host cell death—just not at
the same time. Early in infection, M. tuberculosis (the cause
of tuberculosis) orchestrates the inhibition of host cell suicide pathways to enable the organism to grow, but then
later it promotes suicide as a way to disseminate.
Autophagy is a highly regulated mechanism by which
eukaryotic cells form intracellular vesicles around damaged organelles to scavenge them for nutrients. Autophagy is also used as a universal innate defense mechanism
to fight intracellular pathogens (Fig. 25.33). Autophagic
vacuoles (autophagosomes) can encase these pathogens
and deliver them to degradative lysosomes for destruction. Pathogen components are then sent to endosomes,

protein central to autophagosome production. Interactome
studies indicate that RNA viruses, as a group, encode proteins that can interact with 35% of autophagy-associated
proteins, suggesting that autophagy is widely targeted by
pathogens.
Shigella, a cause of bacterial dysentery, avoids autophagy by making tails of polymerized host actin that propel
the microbe through host cytoplasm (described earlier).
This tactic may sometimes work, but the host can stop the
bacterium from making actin tails by wrapping Shigella
in septin filaments, as shown in the 3D rendering in Figure 25.34. Septin cages initially require actin to form, but
then they inhibit actin polymerization. The septin-caged
microbe is now trapped and marked for autophagy. One of
the discoverers of autophagy, Yoshinori Ohsumi, won the
2016 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

ria and viruses misdirect the immune system? One way is
to target a regulatory mechanism common to many host
systems—namely, ubiquitylation (ubiquitination). Ubiquitin is a highly conserved, 76-amino-acid polypeptide in
eukaryotes that can be covalently attached to other proteins. Attachment involves an enzymatic cascade of three
enzymes: E1, E2, and E3 (reviewed in eTopic 8.5). Depending on where ubiquitin is placed on a protein, the protein
can be activated or, alternatively, tagged for destruction by
the host proteasome. While there are only a few E1 and
E2 enzymes, there are hundreds of E3 ubiquitin ligase
enzymes that recognize and tag target proteins with polyubiquitin. There are also deubiquitylation enzymes that can
reverse the process.

where microbial structures are recognized by endosomal
Toll-like receptors that trigger the innate immune system
(see Chapter 23). The microbial components (antigens)
are also sent to cell compartments rich in major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) molecules. MHC II molecules then rise to the cell surface and present the microbial
antigens to the adaptive immune system as described in
Chapter 24.
Intracellular pathogens, however, have evolved mechanisms that can prevent autophagy and prolong their
survival. For example, the Nef protein of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and protein M2 of influenza prevent autophagosome formation by targeting beclin 1, a

CHAPTER 25

In contrast to their eukaryotic hosts, viral and bacterial pathogens lack ubiquitylation systems but have evolved
E3 ligases and deubiquitylases that effectively subvert normal host ubiquitylation pathways (Fig. 25.35). Like someone changing signs on a highway, the viral enzymes cause
host signaling systems, and the immune system, to veer off
course.
There are several ways ubiquitylation normally directs
the immune system. In the innate immune system, TLR
pathway proteins are ubiquitylated as a way to induce production of inflammatory cytokines. When a MAMP binds
to a TLR, ubiquitylation of signal induction proteins will
activate the signal. In contrast, proteins that inhibit the
pathway are marked by ubiquitin for destruction. The
result is an activated signal pathway that leads to the formation of inflammatory cytokines (Fig. 25.35, step 1).
To subvert this system, some pathogens produce their
own E3 ligases that divert the normal signal induction
pathways. For example, rotavirus, a major cause of infant
diarrhea, produces an E3 ligase that adds ubiquitin to
activators of NF-kappaB, the transcription regulator that
induces cytokine production (Fig. 25.35, step 2). The
ubiquitylated proteins are destroyed, and NF-kappaB is not
activated. Using a different strategy, the bacterial pathoatt
gen Salmonella enterica produces a deubiquitylase that

■

removes ubiquitin from a normal inhibitor of NF-kappaB.
The inhibitor is not degraded, which means that NF-kappaB
is not activated and inflammatory cytokines are not made
(step 3). In both instances, inflammation is minimized,
allowing the pathogen to survive.
Ubiquitylation is an important mechanism for adaptive
immunity too. For example, the process regulates when
cell-surface MHC class I and II molecules are expressed in
dendritic cells (Fig. 25.36). Before dendritic cells mature,
MHC molecules are polyubiquitylated and degraded, limiting their placement on cell surfaces. After maturation, however, the MHC molecules are no longer ubiquitylated and,
as a result, accumulate on the cell surface, making dendritic
cells better equipped for antigen presentation. A number
of viruses exploit this process by producing viral E3 ligases
that polyubiquitylate MHC proteins (Fig. 25.36). The
MHC molecules that would present viral proteins to the
immune system are degraded.
Some pathogens even make E3 ligases that ubiquitylate
host proteins that are not normally tagged. One example

Deubiquitylation saves the inhibitor from

Some viral E3 ligases can ubiquitylate the MHC molecules, marking

is found in the interferon signal cascade. Interferons are
secreted by virus-infected host cells, bind to interferon
receptors on uninfected cells, and induce the expression
of numerous genes that protect the uninfected cell from
virus infection. Paramyxoviruses such as mumps and measles viruses produce E3 ligases that ubiquitylate key regulatory components (JAK-STAT) of the interferon signal
cascade, which marks them for destruction. The host cell
then becomes quite vulnerable to virus attack.
These examples demonstrate that ubiquitylation is a
crucial part of immune regulation and a popular target of
pathogens. Gaining an understanding of the ways ubiquitylation directs the immune system and how pathogens
influence that direction could lead to new ways of enhancing host defense.
Not all bacterial E3 ubiquitin ligases target hostencoded proteins. Legionella secretes an E3 ligase effector protein (LubX) that targets another Legionella effector
(SidH) for destruction by the host cell proteasome. LubX
triggers SidH degradation late during the infection. The
role of SidH during the early phase of Legionella infection,
however, is not yet known.
Clearly, facultative and obligate intracellular pathogens
have developed many ingenious strategies to take control of
host cell defenses, but the host, for its part, has also evolved
effective countermeasures.

Two-component signal transduction systems can regulate virulence gene expression in response to the host
environment.
Quorum sensing may prevent pathogens from releasing
toxic compounds too early during infection.
Extracellular pathogens evade the immune system by
hiding in capsules, by changing their surface proteins, or
by triggering apoptosis.
Intracellular bacterial pathogens attempt to avoid the
immune system by growing inside host cells. They use
different mechanisms to avoid intracellular death.
Hemolysins are used by certain pathogens to escape
from the phagosome and grow in the host cytoplasm.
Actin tails are used by some microbes to move within
and between host cells.
Inhibiting phagosome-lysosome fusion is one way
pathogens can survive in phagosomes.
Molecular mechanisms for avoiding the immune system include molecular mimicry, altering cytokine profiles, stopping programmed host cell death, interfering
with autophagy, and redirecting ubiquitylation signals.
Specialized physiologies enable some organisms to
survive in the normally hostile environment of fused
phagolysosomes.

Experimental Tools That
Probe Pathogenesis

For any scientist studying pathogenic microbes, it is essential to identify virulence genes and determine what they do.
As mentioned in Section 25.2, Falkow’s molecular Koch’s
postulates argue that once a gene has been singled out as a
possible virulence factor, proof requires knocking out the
gene and observing a decrease in virulence, followed by

CHAPTER 25

restoring virulence by replacing the mutant gene. But how
do you identify which genes to test? Earlier, in Section 25.2
(and see also eTopics 25.1 and 25.2), we discussed how virulence genes in microbes can be identified using some clever
selection techniques. Today there exist amazing molecular
techniques that can broadly, and quickly, reveal a microbe’s
overall pathogenic strategy and help scientists focus on
likely virulence genes. In addition, powerful techniques
can now deeply probe how pathogens and hosts respond to
each other during an infection.

Genomics

The sequencing of a pathogen’s genome (discussed in Chapter 7), followed by bioinformatic analysis of the sequence
(described in Chapter 8), can yield valuable information
about a pathogenic organism’s metabolism and can identify
potential pathogenicity islands and virulence genes.
Clues about potential virulence genes can also be
gained by comparing the sequences of virulent and attenuated strains of a pathogen. For example, Leptospira species are spirochetes that cause a zoonotic renal disease in
humans called leptospirosis. Dereck Fouts (J. Craig Venter
Institute), Joseph Vinetz (UC San Diego), and colleagues
recently compared the genome sequences of numerous
Leptospira species differentially classified as pathogenic,
intermediate, and nonpathogenic. They discovered a
subset of genes whose distribution was restricted to the
pathogenic strains, meaning that these genes potentially
contribute to Leptospira pathogenesis or host adaptation. The pathogen-unique genes included, among others, a catalase, a protease able to degrade complement, a
large family of virulence-modifying proteins of unknown
function, and a CRISPR-Cas system. The results provided
many new directions for research that probes leptospiral
pathogenesis.
DNA sequencing can also reveal how to grow so-called
obligate intracellular pathogens in the laboratory. The
Gram-positive microorganism Tropheryma whipplei is an
intracellular pathogen that causes the gastrointestinal illness called Whipple’s disease. The symptoms of Whipple’s
disease include diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, abdominal
pain, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, and weakness.
Though identified, the causative agent had never been
grown outside of fibroblast cells, making it nearly impossible to study its physiology. Once the complete genome
sequence of T. whipplei became available, however, Didier
Raoult and colleagues at the Marseille School of Medicine discovered that the organism lacks the machinery
to make several amino acids. The investigators were then
able to design a cell-free culture medium that supported
the growth of T. whipplei. Similar approaches were used to
coax cell-free growth of the so-called obligate intracellular

pathogen Coxiella burnetii. C. burnetii causes the respiratory infection Q fever. Genomic strategies like these should
lead to other successes in growing previously unculturable
intracellular pathogens.

Transcriptomics

Other major goals of infectious disease research include
learning how a pathogen causes an infection, how the host
responds to the infection, and how the pathogen responds
to the host’s response. The situation is much like watching
two armies waging war with numerous weapons at their
disposal. Is there a way to view the molecular drama of
host-pathogen interactions? There is now.
Dual RNA sequencing. RNAseq analysis has been used to
separately monitor transcript modulation in pathogens during the course of an infection, or to view the host’s transcriptional response to a pathogen. Jörg Vogel (Fig. 25.37A) at
the University of Würzburg and colleagues recently used
RNAseq to simultaneously profi le the changing host and
pathogen transcriptomes during Salmonella infection of
human host cells. The scientists started by infecting human
cells with GFP-labeled Salmonella and using fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS; see Section 4.3) to select host
cells at two different stages of infection: 4 hours (10 bacteria
per cell) and 24 hours (75 bacteria per cell) (Fig. 25.37B,
see also Fig. 25.27). The researchers then used Illumina
technology (see Sections 7.6 and 10.6) to simultaneously
sequence pathogen and host cell transcripts. Their analysis
showed that 4 hours postinfection, bacterial transcripts of
SPI-1 genes decreased relative to levels just prior to infection, while the transcript levels of SPI-2 genes increased
(Fig. 25.37C). Their analysis also found that host genes
activated by NF-kappaB were elevated at 4 hours postinfection (Fig. 25.37D). NF-kappaB is a transcriptional activator of cytokine genes. The NF-kappaB result illustrates the
host response to Salmonella invasion.
The scientists then refined the strategy to identify Salmonella small RNA transcripts that became induced during
infection. The most highly induced was the 80-nt sRNA
called PinT (PhoP-induced sRNA in intracellular Salmonella). This sRNA was found to control the transition from
SPI-1 to SPI-2 expression. By altering the timing of this
transition, PinT also influenced many other aspects of host
cell physiology, including production of cytokine IL-8 and
mitochondrial gene expression. Figure 25.38 shows how
the loss of PinT led to relocalization of mitochondria (red)
in infected host cells.
The simultaneous examination of host and pathogen
transcriptional profiles by dual RNAseq techniques will
reveal other hidden gene functions in pathogens with profound effects on host cells.

MICROBIAL PATHOGENESIS

Secreted protein

You have seen numerous examples throughout this and previous chapters in which fluorescent stains, proteins (GFP), and
antibodies combined with fluorescent microscopy were used
to identify dramatic alterations in host cell structures, as well
as the movement/location of bacterial or host cell proteins
during the course of an infection. A relatively new fluorescent
technology has been developed that can identify which host
cells during an infection have been targeted by translocated
microbial effector proteins. The affected host cells fluoresce
and can be sorted by a FACS machine for closer examination.
The technique relies on fluorescence resonance energy
transfer, FRET (Fig. 25.39). FRET employs a fluorescent probe molecule composed of a donor fluorophore
linked to an acceptor fluorophore. The emission spectrum
of the donor overlaps with the absorption spectrum of the
acceptor, essentially quenching donor fluorescence. Breaking the link between the two fluorophores, however, separates them. The donor fluorophore, now free from the
quenching molecule, will produce strong, detectible emission upon excitation. This FRET strategy has been used to
identify subsets of host cells targeted by any of the type III,
IV, or VI secretion systems that pathogens employ to translocate effector proteins into host cells.
The technique involves constructing a translational
fusion between a gene encoding a bacterial effector protein
and a beta-lactamase gene (Fig 25.39, step 1; see Chapter 12). Beta-lactamase is an enzyme that cleaves the antibiotic penicillin and will also cleave the fluorescent probe
(see Chapter 27). Once expressed, the fusion protein can
be translocated from the pathogen directly into host cells
(step 2), but not all types of host cells are targeted. Host
cells that receive the protein can be identified by adding the
fluorescent reporter CCF4-AM. The quenched fluorescent
reporter enters all host cells, but fluorophore and quencher
can be separated only by host cells that received the betalactamase-effector fusion protein (step 3). Fluorescence
microscopy or FACS analysis can then identify those cells.

Uganda, this Aedes mosquito–borne virus was thought to cause
only mild rashes and fever. In May 2015, however, Zika virus
spread from central Africa to South America, where it infected
thousands. Many pregnant women became infected and delivered babies with very small heads, a consequence of incomplete
brain development. Could the virus have caused neonatal microcephaly? Recently, Tatjana AvŠiČ Županc and colleagues discovered direct evidence of the link when they found Zika virus in

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Infectious diseases have challenged human existence for
millions of years. Our tenacity as a species is due in no small
way to our growing ability to diagnose, treat and prevent
known infections, and to identify new emerging ones. The
Current Research Highlight is an example of the latter.
By discovering the viral genome in the brain of a microcephalic fetus, Tatjana Avšič Županc and neuropathologist
Mara Popović (Fig. 26.1) provided a direct link between
Zika virus and microcephaly. The story of Zika virus is still
unfolding; we don’t yet know how discovering Zika virus
in fetal brain tissue will impact diagnosis or treatment. But
ultimately it will.
In Chapter 26 we discuss a wide variety of infectious
microbes by describing their infectious routes, the pathologies they cause, and the symptoms that result. We also
examine prevention strategies such as vaccinations when
available. Antimicrobial treatments are surveyed later in
Chapter 27, while laboratory diagnostics and epidemiological considerations are examined in Chapter 28.
What we present in this chapter is not an exhaustive
compendium of microbial illnesses, but a representative
sampling of infections that illustrate key aspects of microbial disease. The material is arranged and presented so as to
integrate your knowledge of microbiology and immunology within the framework of the practice of medicine and
the study of infectious disease.

26.1

Diagnosing Microbial
Diseases

What is the best way to classify microbial diseases? Microbial diseases are often presented from the microbe’s point
of view; for example, where in the body does E. coli cause
disease? Classifying diseases by organism is useful when
examining the ways a given species can cause disease in different organ systems. For instance, E. coli can cause genitourinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections, and
meningitis. How do the various strains causing these diseases differ from one another?
Pathogens can also be classified by their route of infection (or portal of entry; see Chapter 25). In this approach,
pathogens are grouped as food-borne, airborne, bloodborne, or sexually transmitted; or grouped by transmission
such as fecal-oral, respiratory, or insect-borne. However,
once having entered the body, different pathogens can
again infect widely diverse organ systems. In Chapter 26,
we look at infectious agents from the vantage point of the
infected organ. We ask, for example, what pathogens cause
lung infections, and how are they differentially diagnosed?
The organ approach for classifying microbial diseases is
more attuned to how health care workers interact with a

must determine from the patient that the disease is localized to the chest and then theorize that it may be a respiratory tract infection. Appropriate samples are then collected
and sent to a clinical microbiology laboratory, where data
are generated to confirm or dispute the presence of a specific etiological agent, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or
other lung pathogens. So how is the infectious cause of a
disease diagnosed?

The Art of Diagnosis

Diagnosing an infectious disease is not just a matter of taking a specimen, ordering a test, and prescribing a drug. The
clinician first needs to figure out which microbes, out of
hundreds, are possible causes. When you go to the clinic,
what does a clinician first ask? “What brings you here
today?” followed by “How long have you had these symptoms?” and perhaps “Where have you traveled recently?”
This is not idle conversation; the clinician is taking a patient
history.
Because many infectious diseases display similar symptoms, a patient history can provide clues about the possible

culprit. For example, Vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic
E. coli both produce diarrheal diseases characterized by
cramps, lethargy, and liters of watery stool each day. So
when a patient presents these symptoms, how does the clinician know what microbes to look for? Here is where a
good patient history can make all the difference. Although
cholera is not commonly seen in the United States, a clinician might suspect cholera if the patient recently traveled
to or emigrated from an endemic area where the disease is
regularly observed. This travel information is not gained
by examining the patient but comes from talking with the
patient and taking a patient history.
Many questions asked during the course of taking a
patient’s social history can seem irrelevant or intrusive to
the patient, who only wants relief from the symptoms. For
instance: “Do you have any hobbies? What is your occupation? What foods have you eaten recently? Does your child
attend day care? Has anyone in your family had similar
symptoms?” All of those questions address possible sources
of the infectious agent. Other questions can reveal highrisk behavior that can lead to certain infections. “Do you
smoke, drink, or take recreational drugs? Have you had
multiple sex partners? Do you use contraception?”
Answers to these questions can provide important diagnostic clues to the astute clinician. For example, learning that a man suffering from enlarged glands, fever, and
headaches also likes to hunt and recently killed rabbits can
be important. The patient may have been exposed to the
Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium Francisella tularensis (Fig. 26.2A), a facultative intracellular pathogen that
infects various wild animals and is the cause of tularemia,

an illness also known as “rabbit fever.” The patient could
have accidentally infected a cut while cleaning his kill. Tularemia is an example of a zoonotic disease, an infection that
normally affects animals but can be transmitted to humans.
Or consider the case of a woman with acute pneumonia. Upon learning that the woman is a sheep farmer, the
clinician considers Coxiella burnetii as one of the possible
causes of the infection (the list of possible causes is called
the differential). C. burnetii is a pathogenic bacterial species that infects sheep and is shed in large quantities in the
animal’s amniotic fluid or placenta (Fig. 26.2B). Dried
soil contaminated with C. burnetii can become aerosolized whenever the dirt is disturbed, and any human (such
as a farmer) who inhales the dried particles can develop the
lung infection Q fever. If the woman were an accountant,
C. burnetii would be lower on the differential.
Because patient histories are so helpful in diagnosing
infectious diseases, we will present several case histories in
the following sections and segue into discussions of various
microbes that can infect each organ system. Key aspects of
infectious diseases will emerge as we proceed.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Patient histories are vital in diagnosing microbial
diseases.

Gram-positive organism, often a normal inhabitant of the
nares (nostrils), can infect a cut or gain access to the dermis via a hair follicle. It possesses a number of enzymes that
contribute to disease, including coagulase, which helps coat
the organism with fibrin, thereby walling off the infection
from the immune system and antibiotics. As a result, boils
generally require surgical drainage in addition to antibiotic
therapy. As noted earlier, some strains of S. aureus also produce toxic shock syndrome toxin, a superantigen that can
lead to serious systemic symptoms. Recall that a superantigen links and activates antigen-presenting cells and T cells
by binding to the outside of MHC class II receptors and
T-cell receptors. Antigen recognition is not required. As a
result, many different T cells become activated to release a
flood of cytokines (see Chapters 24 and 25).
A particularly dangerous strain of Staphylococcus aureus
is called methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). S. aureus
infections are commonly treated with penicillin-like drugs,
such as oxacillin (a form of methicillin). MRSA has developed
resistance to methicillin (oxacillin) and many other penicillinlike drugs through a mutation that alters one of the proteins
(called a penicillin-binding protein, PBP) involved in cell wall
synthesis (see Chapter 27). Because methicillin is normally
used as a first line of defense against staphylococcal infections, treatment failure of MRSA can be life-threatening, and
we need to use alternative drugs, such as vancomycin.
MRSA, originally seen mainly as hospital-acquired
(nosocomial) infections, are no longer contained only in
hospitals. Individuals who have not been in a hospital are
being infected with MRSA in what are called communityacquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) infections. CA-MRSA infections are occurring at an epidemic rate in the United States
(an incidence of approximately 20 per 100,000 population).

Zoonotic diseases are animal diseases accidentally transmitted to humans.

26.2

Skin, Soft-Tissue, and
Bone Infections

The basic shape and appearance of the human body is dictated by bones, skin, and soft tissues such as muscle and
underlying connective tissues. Because these organ systems
and tissues collectively shape and maintain body architecture, infections that threaten their integrity will be discussed together. Infections that can affect one of these
tissues can also spread directly to another tissue.
Skin and soft-tissue infections range from simple boils to
severe, complicated, so-called flesh-eating diseases that can
be caused by a variety of bacteria, fungi, and viruses (see
Table 26.1). Recall that the integrity of the skin, as well as
the presence of normal skin microbiota, prevents infection.
However, even minor insults to the skin (such as a paper
cut) can result in infections, most of which are caused by
the Gram-positive pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. Healthy
individuals develop infections of the skin only rarely,
whereas people with underlying immunosuppressive diseases such as diabetes are at much higher risk.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Seventy percent of staphylococcal skin infections are now
caused by MRSA. Thus, a physician can no longer assume
that a patient walking into the office with a staphylococcal
infection will respond to methicillin-like drugs such as oxacillin. The doctor must assume that it may be MRSA. As
a result, treatment regimens around the country, and the
world, are being forced to change. Today, vancomycin and
linezolid are typically used to treat staph infections. Antibiotics are discussed in Chapter 27.
Other staphylococcal diseases are caused by toxin-producing strains in which the organism remains localized but
the toxin disseminates. We have already mentioned TSST,
but there are other toxins. For example, some strains of
S. aureus produce a toxin called exfoliative toxin, which
causes a blistering disease in children called staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (Fig. 26.3B). Exfoliative toxin,
like TSST, is a superantigen (described in Section 24.3). In
addition, exfoliative toxin cleaves a skin cell adhesion molecule that, when inactivated, results in blisters.

through the circulation to produce the symptoms of scalded
skin syndrome (SSS)? Explain why or why not.

children. She suffered a minor cut on her finger, which she

What kind of organism can cause this type of devastating disease? The disease necrotizing fasciitis, also known
incorrectly as “flesh-eating disease,” is rare and is often
caused by the Gram-positive coccus Streptococcus pyogenes
(Fig. 26.4A), a microbe normally associated with throat
infections (pharyngitis). Although sometimes described as a
recently emerging infectious disease, necrotizing fasciitis was
first discovered in 1783, in France. Its incidence may have
risen recently owing to the increased use of nonsteroidal,
anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen), which increase
a person’s susceptibility to infection (see Section 25.2).
In this case history, Cassi probably had this organism on
her skin when the injury to her side occurred. The injured
area probably suffered an invisible microabrasion, providing

bandaged properly. She also injured the left side of her body
while playing sports with her kids. Not thinking much of
either of her minor injuries, she went to bed. Two days later,
Cassi was extremely ill. Her symptoms included vomiting,
diarrhea, and a fever. She was also in severe pain where she
had injured her side, and the area had begun to bruise (the
skin was not broken). By the next day she could barely get out
of bed, and by the end of that night she was having difficulty
breathing and could not see. Her side began to leak fluid and
blood. Cassi was admitted to the hospital in septic shock, with
no detectable blood pressure. An infectious disease specialist
diagnosed the problem as necrotizing fasciitis, and she was
rushed into surgery. In an effort to save her life, about 7% of
her body surface was removed. Because the large wound infection in her side would need to resolve before a skin graft could
be performed to repair it, the hole in Cassi’s body was left wide
open (Fig. 26.4B). Long-term efforts to maintain her blood
pressure included vasopressors that led to gangrene in her fingers (Fig. 26.4C). After nearly 3 months and several operations, Cassi recovered.

a good growth environment for the organism, leading to the
secretion of potent toxins and death of surrounding tissues.
The bacteria will spread in subcutaneous tissue, destroying fat
and fascia without initially harming the skin itself. Fascia is the
sheath of thin, fibrous tissue that covers muscles and organs.
Rapid, aggressive surgical removal of affected tissue and
antibiotic treatment is required in these extreme cases, even
before the clinical microbiology lab has had time to identify
the organism. In this approach to antibiotic treatment, called
empiric therapy, one or more antibiotics are given to “cover”
(kill) the most likely causative agents. Therapy can include
clindamycin and metronidazole (which act against anaerobes
and Gram-positive cocci) and gentamicin (a drug particularly
effective against Gram-negative microbes). (Chapter 27 further
discusses these and other antibiotics.) Often, however, antibiotic treatment of patients with necrotizing fasciitis is ineffective
because of insufficient blood supply to the affected tissues.
A less aggressive but similar skin infection is cellulitis.
Cellulitis is a non-necrotizing inflammation of the dermis
that does not involve the fascia or muscles, but is characterized by localized pain, swelling, tenderness, erythema, and
warmth. S. pyogenes is the most frequent cause of cellulitis
in immunocompetent adults, but a number of other bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Gram-negative bacilli,
and anaerobes, can also cause this skin infection.
Streptococcus pyogenes wields many different virulence
factors, including M protein (pilus-like), superantigen exotoxins, and secreted enzymes such as hyaluronidase and
DNase (some of these are described in Chapter 25). The
sources of many established virulence factor genes in S. pyogenes are the numerous prophages (phage genomes) integrated into the bacterial genome. Prophages constitute
approximately 10% of the organism’s genome. One study
found that a soluble factor produced by human pharyngeal
cells can facilitate activation of at least some of these phages
and cause horizontal transfer of the associated virulence
factors between strains of this pathogen. Prophage activation and phage production are discussed in Chapter 6.

Thought Question

26.2 Why would treatment of some infections require
multiple antibiotics?

Osteomyelitis

Osteomyelitis is a bone infection caused by bacteria with
accompanying inflammation and bone destruction. All
bones can be infected, but the lower extremities are most
commonly involved. Bone can be infected in several ways.
Acute trauma or surgery can directly introduce organisms
into affected bone. Organisms from an adjacent soft-tissue
infection can spread to nearby bone. Organisms can also

spread from peripheral sites of infection to bone through
the circulation (hematogenous seeding), most commonly
the vertebrae because they are well vascularized.
Organisms that commonly cause osteomyelitis include
staphylococci (Staphylococcus aureus), streptococci (Streptococcus pyogenes), Gram-negative bacilli (Pseudomonas,
Escherichia), and some anaerobes (Bacteroides). Bone biopsy is
usually needed to identify the organism. Host factors that contribute to osteomyelitis include diabetes (when a diabetic foot
wound goes untreated), children with sickle-cell disease, joint
prosthetics, and intravenous drug use. Antibiotic treatment of
osteomyelitis is challenging because most bones are not well
vascularized. So debridement is also necessary.

Viral Diseases Causing Skin Rashes

Several viruses can produce skin rashes, although their
route of infection is usually through the respiratory tract.
Measles, for example (see Section 6.1), is a highly contagious viral infection caused by a paramyxovirus, whose
hallmark symptom is skin rash (see Fig. 6.2D). The first
signs of measles, also known as rubeola, are fever, cough,
runny nose, and red eyes occurring 9–12 days after exposure. A few days later, spots (Koplik’s spots) appear in the
mouth, along with a sore throat. Then a skin rash develops
that typically starts on the face and spreads down the body.
The virus replicates in the lymph nodes and spreads to the
bloodstream (viremia), where it can infect endothelial cells
of the blood vessels. The rash occurs when T cells begin to
interact with these infected cells.
Although skin rash is the main symptom of measles,
infection can also cause respiratory symptoms and complications, including pneumonia, bronchitis, croup, and even
a fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised patients. In the
United States, measles has been almost completely eliminated by the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) multivalent vaccine. Worldwide, however, measles is still a serious
problem in places where vaccinations are not routine.
Rubella virus, a togavirus, causes a maculopapular rash
known as German measles, or three-day measles. The rash
is similar to but less red than that of measles (Fig. 26.5).
German measles is an infection that affects primarily the
skin and lymph nodes and is usually transmitted from person to person by aerosolization of respiratory secretions. It is
not dangerous in adults or children; the virus can, however,
cross the placenta in a pregnant woman and infect her fetus.
If the virus crosses the placenta within the first trimester, the
result is congenital rubella syndrome, which can cause death
or serious congenital defects in the developing fetus.
Other viruses affecting the skin, such as chickenpox,
the related disease shingles, smallpox, and human papillomavirus, are included in Table 26.1 and discussed in
eTopic 26.1. The vaccination schedule for preventing these
diseases is provided in Table 24.1.

Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes are
common bacterial causes of skin infections. The organisms usually infect through broken skin.
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)
has become an important cause of community-acquired
staphylococcal infections.
Necrotizing fasciitis is usually caused by Streptococcus
pyogenes, but it can be the result of other infections.
Infections of the skin can disseminate via the bloodstream to other sites in the body.
Osteomyelitis, usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus,
begins with direct bone trauma, hematogenous seeding,
or contact with a nearby soft-tissue infection.
Rubeola and rubella viruses infect through the respiratory tract, but their main manifestation is the production
of similar maculopapular skin rashes.

26.3

Respiratory Tract
Infections

Lung and upper respiratory tract infections are among the
most common diseases of humans. Many different bacteria, viruses, and fungi are well adapted to grow in the lung.
Successful lung pathogens come equipped with appropriate attachment mechanisms and countermeasures to avoid
various lung defenses (such as alveolar macrophages). One
reemerging bacterial pathogen, Bordetella pertussis, the

cause of whooping cough, inhibits the mucociliary escalator by binding to lung cilia (eTopic 26.2). Although many
microbes can infect the lung, most respiratory diseases are
of viral origin, and most viral infections (such as the common cold) do not spread beyond the lung. Fortunately, viral
diseases by and large are self-limiting and typically resolve
within 2 weeks; however, the damage caused by a primary
viral infection can lead to secondary infections by bacteria.
Bacterial infections of the lung, whether of primary or
secondary etiology, require intervention. Today this means
antibiotic therapy. Before the advent of antibiotics, the only
recourse was to insert a tube into the patient’s back to drain
fluid accumulating in the pleural cavity around the lung
(a pathological process known as pleural effusion). Unless
released, the pressure on the lung will collapse the alveoli
and make breathing difficult.
Viral infections predispose patients to secondary bacterial infections in several ways. Viral lung infections cause
the patient to dehydrate, which increases mucus viscosity in
the airways. Increased mucus viscosity limits motility of the
mucociliary escalator (described in Section 23.1), making it
harder to eliminate bacterial pathogens. To keep the escalator moving, cold sufferers are advised to drink plenty of
fluids to decrease mucus viscosity. Another factor leading
to secondary bacterial infections is that viruses can inhibit
key aspects of lung innate-immune mechanisms that prevent
bacterial growth. Note that many deaths resulting from
viral influenza are caused by secondary bacterial infections.

Pneumonia is a disease that can be caused by many different microbes (Table 26.2). The pneumococcus Streptococcus
pneumoniae accounts for about 25% of community-acquired
cases of pneumonia, but pneumococcal pneumonia occurs
mostly among the elderly and immunocompromised,
including smokers, diabetics, and alcoholics. A breakdown
of pneumonia cases by causative organism is shown in
Figure 26.6C.
The noses and throats of 30%–70% of a given population can contain S. pneumoniae. The microbe can be spread
from person to person by sneezing, coughing, or other
close, personal contact. Pneumococcal pneumonia may
begin suddenly, with a severe shaking chill usually followed
by high fever, cough, shortness of breath, rapid breathing,
and chest pains.
Pneumococcal lung infection begins when the pneumococcus is aspirated into the lung. Once in the lung, the
microbe grows in the nutrient-rich edema fluid of the alveolar spaces. Neutrophils and alveolar macrophages then
arrive to try to stop the infection. They are called into the
area from the circulation by chemoattractant chemokines
released by damaged alveolar cells. The thick polysaccharide
capsule of the pneumococcus, however, makes phagocytosis very difficult (see Section 25.6). In an otherwise healthy
adult, pneumococcal pneumonia usually involves one lobe
of the lungs; thus, it is sometimes called lobar pneumonia.
The infiltration of PMNs and fluid leads to the typical radiological findings of diffuse, cloudy areas. In contrast, infants,
young children, and elderly people more commonly develop
an infection in other parts of the lungs, such as around the
air vessels (bronchi), causing bronchopneumonia.
The white blood cell count in the case history is telling.
The patient had an elevated WBC count (normal is 5,000–
10,000/μl) and an elevated proportion of band cells (normal is 0%–5%). These increases are indicative of a bacterial,
not viral, infection. Neutrophils (PMNs), the front-line
combatants against infection, rise in response to bacterial infections and are first released from bone marrow as
immature band cells, whose presence is a sure sign of bacterial infection.
Several outbreaks of pneumococcal pneumonia have
occurred over recent years in nursing homes, where numerous residents have been affected. These incidents underscore

A 35-year-old male boxer named Tyrrell, who installs home
insulation for a living, was admitted to a Maryland hospital
when he presented with difficulty walking, fever, chills, night
sweats, and a recent 10-kg (22-lb) weight loss. He denied having prior pneumonia, sinus infection, arthritis, hematuria
(blood in the urine), numbness, or muscle weakness. Tyrrell
also denied any history of intravenous drug use and had
been in a monogamous relationship for 4 years. There was
no history of travel outside of the area for the past 4 years.
Tyrrell’s past medical history showed that he had visited the
emergency department 6 months earlier with flu-like symptoms, a chronic cough that produced blood-tinged white sputum, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, and weight loss.
One month prior to the current admission, he had developed
some painless subcutaneous nodules and had become so short
of breath that he could no longer continue boxing. At that
time, an X-ray taken in the emergency room showed rightupper-lobe infiltrate, indicating pneumonia (Fig. 26.7A). A
tuberculosis skin test was negative. He was given a prescription for the antibiotic azithromycin (a macrolide antibiotic

the importance of elderly people receiving the pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) as a hedge against infection.
While there are over 80 antigenic types of pneumococcal
capsular polysaccharides, the injected vaccine contains only
the 23 types that are most often associated with disease
(see Section 24.6). A vaccine that is formulated to respond
to multiple antigens is called a “multivalent vaccine.” The
resulting immune response will protect vaccinated individuals against infection by those antigenic types. The vaccine
is recommended for individuals over 65, as well as for those
who are immunocompromised. The patient in this case history failed to receive the vaccine.
In addition to causing serious infections of the lungs
(pneumonia), S. pneumoniae can invade the bloodstream
(bacteremia) and the covering of the brain (meningitis).
The death rates for these infections are about one out of
every 20 who get pneumococcal pneumonia, about four
out of 20 who get bacteremia, and six out of 20 who get
meningitis. Individuals with special health problems, such
as liver disease, AIDS (caused by HIV), or organ transplants, are even more likely to die from the disease, because
of their compromised immune systems.
An emerging infectious disease problem throughout the
United States and the world is the increasing resistance of S.
pneumoniae to antibiotics. At least 30% of the strains isolated
are already resistant to penicillin, the former drug of choice
for treating the disease. Chapter 27 discusses why antibiotic
resistance is on the rise for this and other microbes.

commonly used to treat bacterial infections of the respiratory tract) and discharged. Despite antibiotic treatment, the
cough and weight loss continued. Physical exam at the time of
admission revealed several painful subcutaneous nodules (one
filled with pus) and a tender tibia (indicating bone involvement) that prevented him from walking (Fig. 26.7B). A
CBC (complete blood count) obtained at the time of current
admission showed normal counts and differential.

In this case, the expression of frankly purulent material (pus)
from the left-leg nodule suggested an infectious process. The
infection in this patient probably started in the lung (clued
by the cough), after which the organism spread throughout
the body via the bloodstream. Fungus is a probable cause,
given the chronic nature of the patient’s symptoms. An
alternative possibility would be tuberculosis, caused by the
bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. M. tuberculosis also
causes a chronic lung infection and might have been suspected, except for the negative TB skin test. In the tuberculin skin test, a small amount of mycobacterial antigen called
PPD (purified protein derivative) is injected under the skin
of the lower arm. A person who has been infected with M.
tuberculosis will exhibit a localized delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction at the site of injection, although this does not
equate to currently active disease.
Cryptococcus, an encapsulated yeast, is not the likely cause,
since it typically requires an immunocompromised host to
cause disease—not the case in this instance. (Cryptococcus,
which causes cryptococcosis, is an opportunistic pathogen
that commonly infects AIDS patients.) The most prevalent clinical form of cryptococcosis is meningoencephalitis,
although disease can also involve the skin, lungs, prostate
gland, urinary tract, eyes, myocardium, bones, and joints.
The most likely fungal causes of infection in this case history are the endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis, blastomycosis, and coccidioidomycosis. This patient had never
traveled to the western United States, where coccidioidomycosis is endemic, so exposure to Coccidioides was ruled out.
Histoplasmosis most commonly presents as a flu-like pulmonary illness, with erythema nodosum (tender bumps on skin)
and arthritis (swollen joints) or arthralgia (joint pain), none
of which the patient had. Blastomycosis can disseminate to
the lung, skin, bone, and genitourinary tract, consistent with
the pattern of organ involvement seen in this patient.
Amphotericin B, an antifungal agent (discussed in Section 27.5), was given to this patient. His fever lowered
almost immediately, and the skin nodules diminished.
After 2 weeks, a fungus was found in the cultures of the
nodule biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage (washes), and urine.
This fungus was identified by a DNA probe as Blastomyces dermatitidis (Fig. 26.7C), confirming the diagnosis of
blastomycosis.

B. dermatitidis is a dimorphic fungus that resides in the
soil of the Ohio and Mississippi river valleys and the southeastern United States. The portal of entry is the respiratory
tract, and infection is usually associated with occupational
and recreational activities in wooded areas along waterways,
where there is moist soil with a high content of organic
matter and spores. The incubation period ranges from 21
to 106 days. This patient most likely inhaled conidia (fungal spores) from the soil while crawling underneath houses
installing insulation. The physician learned that the patient
used only a T-shirt to cover his mouth and nose—not an
effective method of keeping spores from entering the respiratory tract. He should have worn a respirator.
Several critical features of this case help differentiate it
from the preceding case of pneumococcal pneumonia. First,
the initial macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin, should have
killed most bacterial sources of infection. Second, the X-ray
finding of diffuse infiltrate is more indicative of fungal lung
infection than bacterial infection, which in a patient of this
age would likely be confined to one lobe. The patient was
young and in good health prior to the infection, making it
unlikely to be pneumococcal pneumonia. The blood count
was also a clue. Fungal infections do not usually cause an
increase in WBCs or an increase in band cells. Finally, the
metastatic lesions (infectious lesions that develop at a secondary site away from the initial site of infection) on the leg
were in no way consistent with Streptococcus pneumoniae.
They arise when the organism moves through the bloodstream from the primary site of infection to another body
site, where it can begin to grow. Many infectious diseases
start out as a localized infection but end up disseminating
throughout the body to cause metastatic lesions.

Note:

The term “metastasis” means the spread of disease
from one organ to another, noncontiguous organ. Only microbial
infections and malignant cancer cells can metastasize.

Tuberculosis as a Reemerging Disease

Tuberculosis, caused by the acid-fast bacillus Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Fig. 26.8 inset), was once considered
of passing historical significance to physicians practicing
in the developed world. In 1985, however, owing primarily to the newly recognized HIV epidemic and a growing
indigent population, TB resurfaced, especially in innercity hospitals. In 1991, highly virulent multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of M. tuberculosis were reported. These
strains not only produced fulminant (rapid-onset) and fatal
disease among patients infected with HIV (the time from
TB exposure to death is 2–7 months), but also proved
highly infectious. Tuberculin skin test conversion rates of
up to 50% were reported in exposed health care workers
(the conversion rate today is less than 1%).

A positive tuberculin skin test (also known as the Mantoux test) is seen as a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction
to M. tuberculosis proteins (called purified protein derivative, or PPD) injected under the skin. Note, however, that a
positive tuberculin skin test does not signify active disease,
but only that the person was infected at one time. The bacterium may have been killed by the immune system without
having caused disease or may lie dormant, waiting to reactivate. MDR-TB cases in 2014 represented approximately
1.3% of new TB cases (9,421). More information on mycobacterial structure can be found in Section 18.3, and on its
pathogenesis, in Section 25.6.
M. tuberculosis causes primarily a respiratory infection (pulmonary TB), but it can disseminate through
the bloodstream to produce abscesses in many different organ systems (extrapulmonary TB). Extrapulmonary
TB is sometimes called miliary TB because the size of the
infected nodules (1–5 mm), called tubercles, approximates
the size of millet seeds. Tubercles in the lung are filled with
M. tuberculosis cells that drain into bronchial tubes and the
upper respiratory tract. Aerosolization of respiratory secretions (coughing) directly spreads the tubercle bacilli from
someone with active disease to an uninfected person (person-to-person transmission, no animal reservoir).
Once inhaled into the lung, the bacilli are subject to
three possible outcomes: They can die, they can produce
primary disease, or they can become latent. In all three
cases the bacteria are initially phagocytosed by alveolar

■

MICROBIAL DISEASES

■

1049

macrophages, and if not killed, they survive ensconced
within modified phagolysosomes. The bacilli can multiply
in these vacuoles, kill the macrophage (via induced apoptosis), and then be released to infect other macrophages. Four
to six weeks postinfection, an infected person can develop
active primary disease marked by a productive cough that
generates sputum. The patient also experiences fever, night
sweats, and weight loss. Patients with active disease are
contagious and produce a delayed-type hypersensitivity
that makes them tuberculin-positive.
An alternative to primary disease is an asymptomatic
latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Here the tubercle
bacilli remain hidden in macrophages and may even become
dormant. The delayed-type hypersensitivity response to the
organism builds small, hard tubercles around these cells.
Over time, the tubercles develop into caseous lesions that
have a cheese-like consistency and can calcify into the hardened Ghon complexes seen on typical X-rays (Fig. 26.8).
The bacteria can remain dormant in these tubercles for
many years. Even primary tuberculosis can resolve and
become latent tuberculosis, unless the organisms were
killed with antibiotics.
In a patient with LTBI, M. tuberculosis can sometimes,
years after initial infection, overcome the imposed confinement of the immune system. The bacteria begin to multiply and cause secondary, or reactivation, tuberculosis.
Secondary TB commonly occurs in immunocompromised
people (such as HIV patients). The symptoms of secondary TB are more serious than those of primary TB and
include severe coughing, greenish or bloody sputum, lowgrade fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The gradual
wasting of the body led to the older name for tuberculosis:
“consumption.”
Ten drugs are currently approved by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) for treatment of tuberculosis. Initial
treatment of active disease is aggressive and involves a fourdrug regimen of what are called first-line drugs (or drugs of
choice)—isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol—given over a course of several months. MDR strains are
defined as being resistant to two or more first-line drugs. An
MDR strain is treated with a regimen of four to five drugs
that do not include the first-line drugs to which it is resistant.
Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) strains are
resistant to three or more second-line drugs (drugs used
when drugs of choice fail), as well as two or more first-line
drugs. These strains are almost untreatable.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Viral Diseases of the Lung

Numerous viruses can cause lung infections (see
Table 26.2). Influenza virus and rhinovirus are described
in Chapters 6 and 11, and compared in eTopic 26.3. The
recently emerged infection SARS (severe acute respiratory
syndrome) is discussed in Chapter 28. However, an important viral lung infection not discussed elsewhere is respiratory syncytial disease, caused by respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV). A negative-sense, single-stranded RNA, enveloped
virus, RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and
pneumonia among infants and children under 1 year of age.
Illness begins most frequently with fever, runny nose,
cough, and sometimes wheezing. RSV is spread from respiratory secretions through close contact with infected persons or by contact with contaminated surfaces or objects.
Infection can occur when the virus contacts mucous membranes of the eyes, mouth, or nose and possibly through
the inhalation of droplets generated by a sneeze or cough.
Unlike rubella or rubeola, which infect the respiratory tract
and disseminate though the body, RSV remains localized
in the lung.
The majority of children hospitalized for RSV infection are under 6 months of age. RSV can cause repeated
infections throughout life, usually associated with moderate to severe cold-like symptoms. Severe lower respiratory
tract disease may occur at any age, especially among the
elderly or people with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or
immune systems. As yet, a vaccine to control this disease
is not available. However, a monoclonal antibody called
palivizumab, which binds to an RSV epitope, can prevent
RSV in high-risk infants that were born premature or with
medical problems such as congenital heart failure.
Table 26.2 presents many other bacterial, fungal, and
viral microbes that can cause respiratory tract infection.
Be aware that very different diseases can produce similar
symptoms. For instance, people constantly confuse influenza (the flu) with the common cold. Symptomatically,
they may start out similarly, but there are telling differences. Influenza is characterized by fever, myalgia (muscle
aches), pharyngitis (sore throat), and headache (viral infection is discussed in Chapter 11). A runny nose is not one
of the symptoms. The common cold, however, manifests as
a runny nose, nasal congestion, sneezing, and throat irritation. No myalgia. The observant clinician will note the
difference.

An elevated white cell count in blood is an indicator of
bacterial infection.
Pneumococcal vaccine should be administered to the
elderly because they are often immunocompromised.
Fungal agents commonly cause long-term, chronic
infections.
Localized bacterial infections in the lung can disseminate via the bloodstream to form metastatic lesions
at other body sites.
Tuberculosis is an ancient bacterial disease with an
increasing mortality rate resulting from multidrug-resistant strains, the susceptibility of HIV patients, and an
increasing indigent population.
Respiratory syncytial virus is one of several viruses that
can cause lung disease, but it rarely disseminates.

26.4

Gastrointestinal
Tract Infections

Nearly everyone has experienced diarrhea, a condition
characterized by frequent loose bowel movements accompanied by abdominal cramps. Hundreds of millions of
cases occur each year in the United States and are a major
cause of death in developing countries. As with respiratory
tract infections, most diarrheal disease is viral in origin,
with rotavirus being the primary culprit. Among the bacteria, the Gram-negative rod Salmonella enterica serovar
Typhimurium and the spiral-shaped or curved bacillus
Campylobacter are the most frequent causes of self-limiting
diarrheal disease.
You might wonder why some microbes prefer the chaos
of diarrhea to the relative stability of a nice commensal relationship. After all, isn’t finding a niche and sticking to it
the goal of every microbe? The simple answer is that diarrhea enables the dissemination of microbes that might
otherwise kill their host or be killed themselves after too
aggressively provoking the host’s immune system. Dissemination allows the microbe to reach new hosts and proliferate. A diarrhea-causing microbe is sort of like a serial bank
robber fleeing from city to city to avoid capture and find
more banks to rob.

To Summarize
■

■

Lung infections are mostly viral, but most deadly lung
infections are caused by bacteria.
The mucociliary escalator is a primary defense mechanism used by the lung to avoid infection.

Types of Diarrhea

What causes diarrhea? Normally, intestinal mucosal cells
absorb water (8–10 liters per day) from the intestinal contents,
essentially drying out stool. Diarrhea occurs when water is
not absorbed or when it actually leaves intestinal cells and

CHAPTER 26

enters the intestinal lumen. The excess water loosens stool,
and diarrhea results. There are several types of diarrhea.
■

Osmotic diarrhea follows the intake of nonabsorbable
substrates, such as lactulose, a synthetic sugar, used to
treat constipation. Lactulose increases osmolarity in the
intestine, which causes water to leave mucosal cells. The
result is osmotic diarrhea. Infectious organisms (such
as rotavirus) that prevent nutrient absorption can cause
osmotic diarrhea. Osmosis is discussed in eAppendix 2.

■

Secretory diarrhea develops when microbes cause
mucosal cells to increase ion secretion, as seen with cholera toxin. Mucosal cells expel water to try to equilibrate
the resulting electrolyte imbalance.

■

Inflammatory diarrhea forms when an infectious agent
triggers the production of inflammatory cytokines that
attract PMNs. Subsequent damage to the intestinal wall
will limit water and nutrient absorption, and cause red
and white blood cells to enter the stool (bloody diarrhea
or dysentery). Shigella, Salmonella species, and some
strains of E. coli can cause infections leading to inflammatory diarrhea.

■

Motility-related diarrhea can develop when enterotoxins made by pathogens such as rotavirus cause intestinal hypermotility. Food moves so quickly through the
intestine (hypermotility) that there isn’t sufficient time
to absorb water or nutrients.

Terms used to describe the inflammation of different
parts of the GI tract include:
■

Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining, for
instance, ulcers);

■

Gastroenteritis (nonspecific term for any inflammation
along the gastrointestinal tract);

■

Enteritis (inflammation mainly of the small intestine);

■

Enterocolitis (inflammation of the colon and small
intestine); and

■

Colitis (inflammation of the large intestine—colon).

Diarrhea due to viral growth, bacterial growth, or toxin
production can cause large amounts of water and electrolytes to leave the intestinal cells and enter the intestinal
lumen. As a result, the patient not only suffers diarrhea but
can become dangerously dehydrated. Most deaths resulting
from infectious diarrhea are the result of dehydration.

Staphylococcal Food Poisoning

We have all heard of the local church picnic where scores of
people become violently ill within hours of eating unrefrigerated potato salad. Staphylococcus aureus is the usual cause

■

MICROBIAL DISEASES

■

1051

of these disasters, but it is not an infection. The culprit is
an enterotoxin (an exotoxin that affects the gastrointestinal tract) secreted by some strains of S. aureus into tainted
foods such as pies, turkey dressing, or potato salad. After
ingestion, the toxin travels to the intestine, where it enters
the bloodstream and stimulates the vagus nerve leading to
the vomit center in the brain.
Because the toxin is preformed, symptoms occur quickly
after ingestion. Within 2–6 hours, the poisoned patient
will begin vomiting and may also experience diarrhea. The
disease, though violent, is not life-threatening and usually
resolves spontaneously within 24–48 hours. In contrast,
diarrhea caused by infectious agents, such as Salmonella
enterica, which must first grow in the victim, do not occur
until 12–24 hours after ingestion, sometimes longer. A clinician noting quick onset of symptoms in a patient will
immediately suspect staphylococcal food poisoning. Obviously, antibiotic treatment is not needed for staph food poisoning, but it may be indicated for other gastrointestinal
infections. Staphylococcal enterotoxins are also heat resistant, so simply heating a food already containing enterotoxin will not destroy the toxic activity.
It is important to recognize that the most important
treatment for diarrhea is rehydration therapy. Vomiting
and diarrhea can cause huge losses in water volume. Because
the exit of water from tissues causes an osmotic imbalance,
salts also leave the cells, to try to reestablish that balance.
The problem is that the resulting electrolyte imbalance can
severely affect cardiovascular, respiratory, and renal systems. Consequently, replacing body fluids orally or by IV is
imperative to prevent death. Rehydration solutions, therefore, must contain glucose as well as sodium and potassium
salts in proper balance (for example, Pedialyte).
Antibiotics are often inappropriate when treating diarrhea. Although antibiotic treatment of infectious gas-

troenteritis seems intuitive, it is rarely used and actually
contraindicated. Most gastrointestinal infections are viral
(norovirus or rotavirus), so antibiotics are ineffective. Likewise, gastroenteritis caused by bacteria usually resolves
spontaneously, without antibiotic treatment. However,
severe systemic disease stemming from gastroenteritis
can develop, often in the young or elderly. Diseases such
as typhoid fever (Salmonella Typhi) or bacillary dysentery
(Shigella dysenteriae) respond well to antibiotics.
In some cases, antibiotic treatment can actually trigger
gastrointestinal disease. For example, many antibiotics used
to treat infectious diseases (especially clindamycin) can
kill most normal intestinal bacteria, except the naturally
resistant Gram-positive anaerobe Clostridioides difficile
(formerly Clostridium difficile), the causative agent of pseudomembranous enterocolitis. Unrestrained by microbial
competition, C. difficile growing at the epithelial surface of

1052

■

PART 5

■

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

the intestine will produce specific toxins that damage and
kill intestinal cells. The organism’s growth leads to inflammation and the formation of exudative plaques along the
intestinal wall (refer to Fig. 23.10). The plaques eventually
coalesce into larger pseudomembrane structures that block
the intestinal mucosa. The blockage causes the malabsorption of nutrients and water, which results in diarrhea. As
the pseudomembrane enlarges, it begins to slough off and
pass into the stool. Diagnosis of this disease involves PCR
identification of the organism or immunological identification of the toxin in fecal samples.
Some patients suffer recurrent C. difficile infections. It
is not clear why, but one suggestion is that spores lodged
in colon folds may escape clearance by peristalsis. Another
hypothesis is that patients with recurrent disease have an
impaired response to the C. difficile toxins. How do you
prevent recurrences? In some instances, after vegetative C.
difficile has been killed by antibiotic treatment, a procedure known as a fecal transplant (see Section 23.2) can be
used to restore a healthy gastrointestinal microbiota that
prevents the recurrence of C. difficile disease.

Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella enterica, and enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) actually invade enterocytes and are considered intracellular pathogens. Enterohemorrhagic E. coli
(EHEC), which also produces leukocytes and blood in
stools, is not an intracellular parasite (it is not invasive), but
causes damaging attachment and effacing lesions, described
in Section 25.3, which destroy the mucosal epithelium.
The resulting inflammation, in conjunction with damage
caused by the Shiga toxin it produces, leads to blood and
white cells in the stool. E. coli O157:H7, the etiological
agent in the case history, is a common serotype of EHEC.
There are at least six different classes of pathogenic
E. coli that differ in their repertoire of pathogenicity islands,
plasmids, and virulence factors. They include EIEC and
EHEC, already mentioned; enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)
and uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC), both described in
Chapter 25; as well as enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) and
enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC). All but UPEC causes
gastrointestinal disease. (A new diarrheagenic strain is
described in Special Topic 26.1) To tell these strains apart,
each group has telltale O and H antigens that can be identified using serology.

Case History: Enterohemorrhagic E. coli

Note:

Tammy, a 6-year-old girl from Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, arrived at the ER with bloody diarrhea, a temperature of 39°C (102.2°F), abdominal cramping, and vomiting.
She was admitted to the hospital 5 days after a kindergarten
field trip to the local dairy farm. When the parents were questioned about Tammy’s activities during the trip, they said she
had purchased a snack while at the farm. Upon laboratory
analysis, a fecal smear was positive for leukocytes, and isolation of organisms confirmed the presence of Gram-negative
rods that produced Shiga toxins 1 and 2. In subsequent testing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, the isolate was indistinguishable from E. coli O157:H7. By this time, Tammy had
developed additional problems. Her face and hands became
puffy, she had decreased urine output despite being given IV
fluids (suggesting kidney damage), and she was beginning to
develop some neurological abnormalities. Laboratory analyses of blood samples revealed thrombocytopenia (reduced blood
platelet count) and confirmed hemolytic uremic syndrome
(HUS; renal failure). The child was treated by IV fluid and
electrolyte replacement. Antibiotics were not administered.
Tammy eventually recovered.
In this case history, the presence of leukocytes in a fecal
smear is a sign that the intestinal pathogen may have
invaded the epithelial mucosa of the intestine (or severely
damaged it). Breaching this barrier sends out a chemical
call to neutrophils, which then enter the area and, in an
effort to kill the pathogen, also damage the intestinal cells.

“O antigen” is part of the bacterium’s LPS, while “H antigen” is a flagellar protein. Thus, “O157:H7” denotes the specific
version of LPS (O157) and flagellar protein (H7) found on E. coli
O157:H7. Other pathogenic strains of E. coli have different O and
H antigens.

Shiga toxin. Shigella and EHEC, the agent in the preceding case history, both produce toxins, called Shiga toxins 1 and 2, that are encoded by genes of bacteriophage
genomes embedded in the bacterial chromosome. These
toxins inhibit host protein synthesis and, in the process,
damage endothelial cells in the intestine, kidney, and brain.
Shiga toxin–induced death of vascular endothelial cells in
the intestine causes the breakdown of blood vessel linings,
followed by hemorrhage that manifests as bloody diarrhea.
Shiga toxin 2 also triggers the release of pro-inflammatory
cytokines.
Endothelial damage initiates the formation of plateletfibrin microthrombi (clots) that occlude blood vessels in the
various organs, leading to two major syndromes: hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). HUS occurs when the microthrombi
are limited to the kidney. The microclots clog the tiny
blood vessels in this organ and cause decreased urine output, ultimately leading to kidney failure and death. In TTP,
the clots occur throughout the circulation, causing reddish
skin hemorrhages called petechiae and purpuras. Neurological symptoms (for example, confusion, severe headaches,
and possibly coma) then arise from microhemorrhages

CHAPTER 26

in the brain. The hemorrhaging occurs because platelets
needed for normal clotting have been removed from the
circulation as they form the microthrombi. The decreased
number of platelets is called thrombocytopenia.
The toxins, which are absorbed through the intestine
and disseminated via the bloodstream, have five B subunits
used to bind to target cell membranes, and one A subunit
imbued with toxic activity (see Section 25.4). The A subunit, upon entry, destroys protein synthesis by cleaving an
adenine from 28S rRNA in eukaryotic ribosomes.
Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). E. coli O157:H7 is a

recently emerged pathogen that can colonize cattle intestines at the recto-anal junction without affecting the
animal and, as a result, can contaminate meat products following slaughter. Initially identified in 1982, the organism
came to national prominence during a large-scale U.S. outbreak, in 1993, linked to a Washington State Jack in the
Box restaurant in which 732 people were sickened.
E. coli O157:H7 rarely affects the health of the reservoir animal. But when an infected steer is slaughtered, the
carcass can become contaminated with EHEC-containing
feces despite manufacturers’ considerable efforts to prevent it. Grinding the tainted meat into hamburger distributes the microbe throughout. Cooking burgers to 160°C
is essential to kill any existing EHEC. Cross-contamination between foods is possible too. Using the same cutting
board to prepare meat and salad is a great way to contaminate the salad, which will not be cooked.
Despite EHEC’s common association with hamburger,
vegetarians are not safe from this organism. During heavy
rains, waste from a cattle farm can easily wash into nearby
vegetable fields unless precautions are taken. If the cattle
waste contains E. coli O157:H7, the crops become contaminated. One such outbreak occurred in 2006, when spinach
from certain areas of California were contaminated with
this pathogen, prompting a nationwide recall of bagged
spinach and a month without spinach salad.
Early on, the remarkably low infectious dose of E. coli
O157:H7 mystified researchers. However, we have since
learned that E. coli has an impressive level of acid resistance,
rivaling that of the gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori.
Acid resistance mechanisms permit E. coli to survive in the
acidic stomach and enable a mere 10–100 individual organisms to cause disease.
As already noted, EHEC strains produce two toxins
that are identical to the Shiga toxins produced by Shigella
species. The toxins cleave host ribosomal RNA, thereby
halting translation. As discussed earlier, one consequence
of Shiga toxin is HUS. The development of HUS, as in the
case history described, is a common consequence of E. coli
O157:H7 infection. Unfortunately, HUS can be treated
only with supportive care, such as blood transfusions and

■

MICROBIAL DISEASES

■

1053

dialysis throughout the critical period until kidney function resumes. Antibiotic treatment can increase the release
of Shiga toxins from the organisms and actually trigger
HUS. Thus, antimicrobial therapy is not recommended.
In contrast to the case just described, many gastrointestinal infections do not produce fecal leukocytes or blood
in the stool. Diarrheal diseases caused by Vibrio cholerae
(cholera) or enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC), which produces a cholera-like disease, do not involve invasion of the
intestinal lining by the microbe, and they yield copious
amounts of watery diarrhea. In these two toxin-driven diseases, the bacteria attach to cells lining the intestine and
secrete toxins that are imported into the target cells (see
Section 25.4).
Epidemiology of EHEC. Epidemiology is the study of factors

and mechanisms involved in the spread of disease. Researchers at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC) used epidemiological principles (discussed later, in
Chapter 28) to identify the risk factors associated with the
case study presented earlier. They interviewed 51 infected
patients and 92 controls (children who visited the farm but
did not become ill). Infected patients were more likely than
controls to have had contact with cattle, an important reservoir for E. coli O157:H7. All 216 cattle on the farm were
sampled by rectal swab, and 13% yielded E. coli O157:H7
with a DNA restriction pattern indistinguishable from that
isolated from the patients. This fi nding indicated that the
cattle were the source of infection.
Furthermore, separate areas were not established for
eating and interactions with farm animals. Visitors could
touch cattle, calves, sheep, goats, llamas, chickens, and a
pig while eating and drinking. Hand-washing facilities
were unsupervised and lacked soap, and disposable hand
towels were out of the children’s reach. All of these circumstances provided opportunity for infection.
How can we prevent disease caused by enterohemorrhagic E. coli? Industry approaches include thoroughly
washing carcasses before processing, maintaining cold temperatures, and testing for possible contamination. In addition, the use of gamma irradiation to sterilize beef, spinach,
and lettuce has been approved. Recent outbreaks of EHEC
disease caused by contaminated hamburger have declined
dramatically because of industry practices and USDA
inspections. Irradiation could eliminate the problem
(described in Chapter 5), but less than 1% of hamburger
meat is currently irradiated in the United States.
Type III secretion and diarrhea. Type III secretion systems
were fi rst described in Section 25.5, where we discussed
the pathogenesis of Salmonella enterica, but these systems
are present in numerous Gram-negative pathogens, such

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

SPECIAL TOPIC 26.1- - Sprouts and an Emerging Escherichia coli
In May 2011, people in Germany began dying from hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS) (Fig. 1). As of June, 3,228 cases and
35 deaths had been reported. By then, a massive epidemiological hunt was under way for the cause of the disease and
its source. The organism isolated in each case was a form
of E. coli rarely seen before. Its LPS and flagellar serotype
was O104:H4. The organism secreted type 2 Shiga toxin,
which contributed to HUS but, strangely, did not produce
the attaching and effacing proteins often associated with
enterohemorrhagic E. coli (for instance, strain O157:H7).
Unfortunately, this unique pathovar also harbored a plasmid that conveyed resistance to all penicillins, cephalosporins, and co-trimoxazole. Another feature was the presence
of enteroaggregative adherence fimbriae (aaf), which allow
E. coli to adhere like stacked bricks to host cells. Again, AAF
factor is not usually seen in Shiga toxin–producing E. coli
(called STEC), but it is a defining feature of enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC).
One more odd thing about this HUS outbreak was that a
majority of the patients (90%) were adults rather than children, the usual victims of EHEC or other STEC strains. All of
this evidence, plus extensive DNA sequence analysis, indicates
that the deadly O104:H4 strain is a genetic hybrid between
enterohemorrhagic and enteroaggregative strains of E. coli.
As a result, it is officially referred to as EAHEC O104:H4. What
series of unfortunate events produced this “chimeric” patho-

gen? The stx-2 gene is part of a prophage that can horizontally transfer between strains of E. coli, but the trafficking of
the aaf and drug resistance characteristics is less apparent
and under investigation.
A particularly hideous aspect of disease produced by
O104:H4 is that the prevalence of HUS symptoms in diarrheagenic patients far exceeds the usual rate for typical
EHEC victims. But why? One hypothesis is that this variant
produces high amounts of Shiga toxin (Stx-2) as compared
to other STEC strains. Victor Gannon and his colleagues at
the University of Lethbridge and the Public Health Agency
of Canada demonstrated this in vitro using mitomycin C.
Mitomycin C is a DNA intercalating agent that can trigger
reactivation of prophages via the SOS response (see Chapter 9), and in so doing, it stimulates the expression of phageencoded toxin genes. Figure 2 shows that after mitomycin
C treatment, the O104:H4 strain produced five to six times
more Shiga toxin than did other EHEC strains. It is thought
that conditions in the gastrointestinal tract could induce a
similar response.
The HUS outbreak started in May 2011. By early June, the
finger-pointing had begun. Germany initially blamed Spanish cucumbers, which led to a huge economic loss in Spain
as foreign countries refrained from importing these vegetables. Later it was shown that Spain was not the source of this
organism. Finally, the German agricultural minister of Lower
Saxony announced that an organic farm near Uelzen, which
produces a variety of sprouted foods, was the likely source
of the E. coli outbreak (Fig. 3). Before the source was found,
however, several tourists visiting Germany ingested the
organism and returned to their home countries, including the
United States and Canada, where they then developed HUS.
Fortunately, as of this writing, no further major outbreaks
caused by this pathogen have been reported.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

as EHEC in our case history. Recall that type III protein
secretion systems directly inject proteins from the cytoplasm of a bacterial pathogen into the cytoplasm of a target eukaryotic host cell. The system delivers proteins across
three membranes—two from the Gram-negative bacterial
pathogen and one surrounding the target cell.
In addition to stimulating bacterial entry into host cells,
bacterial proteins injected by type III transport systems
cause host cells to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines.
The cytokines then “call in” inflammatory cells and alter
ion transport through the epithelial membrane. Excessive
export of ions such as chloride causes water to leave the cell
in an attempt to equilibrate the internal and external ionic
concentrations. The water entering the intestine results in
diarrhea. Type III–translocated effector proteins induce
many host cellular responses that contribute to intestinal
inflammation during an infection.

Rotavirus and Norovirus

Many people wrongly think that most cases of diarrhea
are caused by a bacterial agent. Actually, two viruses—
rotavirus and norovirus—cause more intestinal disease
than any bacterial species. See Table 6.1: Rotavirus is classified in Group III (dsRNA viruses); norovirus is in Group
IV (positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses). Rotavirus
is highly infectious, spreading by the fecal-oral route; it is
endemic around the globe, and it affects all age groups,
although children between 6 and 24 months are the most
severely affected. It is estimated that by age 3, all children
have had a rotavirus infection.
The incubation period is approximately 2 days, after
which the victim commonly suffers frequent watery, dark
green, explosive diarrhea. All of this may be accompanied
by nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping. Severe dehydration and electrolyte loss due to the diarrhea will cause
death unless supportive measures, such as fluid replacement,
are undertaken. There is no cure, but most patients recover
if rehydrated properly. Few deaths from rotavirus occur in
the United States, but each year more than 400,000 children worldwide die from this viral diarrhea (2014 estimate).
The mortality and incidence of this disease have decreased
because of the introduction in 2006 of a safe and effective
vaccine (see Section 24.6). In Mexico alone, the vaccine
resulted in a 50% decline in diarrheal deaths.
With the success of the rotavirus vaccine, norovirus is set
to become the most common worldwide cause of nonbacterial gastroenteritis. Norovirus infections have already surpassed rotavirus in the United States. The virus is perceived
as the scourge of cruise ships and assisted-living facilities,
but norovirus can also spread quickly in hotels or anywhere
there are many people in a small area. The virus spreads by

the fecal-oral route among children or adults, via contaminated food or person-to-person contact. Within 24 hours
of infection, the victim experiences sudden vomiting, stomach cramps, and watery diarrhea that mercifully resolves
within 12–24 hours. Treatment is similar to that for rotavirus, and there is no vaccine. Death is rare, but most common among infants and the elderly.

Note:

Norovirus infection is sometimes called the “stomach
flu,” but that is a misnomer. It is not the flu and has nothing to do
with influenza virus.

Diarrhea and the gut microbiome. An obvious question to
ask about diarrhea is how does it affect the microbiome? A
study headed by Shannon Manning (Michigan State University) found that the composition of intestinal microbiota
of patients with diarrhea differs significantly from that of
their healthy family members.
For one thing, the gut microbiomes of diarrhea patients
who were not given antibiotics were less diverse than those
of their uninfected family members. Abundance of Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes was higher in the healthy individuals, whereas Proteobacteria dominated the patient
microbiomes. Escherichia coli, for instance, predominated
in all patients regardless of the pathogen causing the infection. The composition of diarrheal microbiomes also varied
with the bacterial cause of infection. As one example, the
microbiome of Campylobacter-infected patients differed
from that of patients infected with Salmonella or Shigella.
How does the intestine restore its bacterial population
after being decimated by diarrhea or antibiotic treatment?
Lawrence David (Duke University), Peter Turnbaugh
(UC San Francisco) (Fig 26.9A), and their colleagues
used metagenomic procedures to characterize the stools
of 41 people in Bangladesh (children and adults) who had
diarrhea caused by E. coli or V. cholerae. Stools were monitored before, during, and after diarrhea episodes.
The researchers identified a consistent succession of
repopulation events in nearly every case, regardless of the
cause of diarrhea (Fig 26.9B). After diarrhea (or antibiotic
treatment for the diarrhea) clears out much of the microbiome, carbohydrates and oxygen accumulate in the gut.
Carbohydrates and oxygen would normally be metabolized
by gut microbiota. During the early stage of repopulation,
facultative, oxygen-respiring and carbohydrate-utilizing
bacteria (especially those using simple carbohydrates, such
as Escherichia, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus) colonize
the gut and consume these nutrients. Midstage recovery
begins when the lack of simple sugars and oxygen (as well
as increased phage predation) leads to a decline in the earlystage species. This decline allows succession to anaerobic,
complex carbohydrate-fermenting bacteria (Bacteroides).

Finally, in late-stage recovery, the gut microbiome once
again resembles the complex community that existed prior
to infection—the same composition seen in healthy contacts (Fig. 26.9B). The entire process takes about 30 days
to complete but depends on a variety of factors, such as
diet, antibiotic use, and duration of diarrhea.
Repopulation occurs, in part, by reingesting microbes
from food. But exciting research suggests that the much
maligned and trivialized appendix is, among other things,
an important reservoir of gut microbes that can seed the
intestine and reestablish the microbiota. Once properly reestablished, gut microbiota are capable of fending off pathogens such as C. difficile. As evidence, researchers found
that patients with appendectomies were more than twice as
likely to develop repetitive infections with C. difficile.

Protozoan Causes of Diarrheal Disease

As we learned in Chapter 20, some protozoa (also called
protists) cause serious human diseases. For instance,

Entamoeba histolytica and Cryptosporidium parvum cause
the diarrheal diseases amebic dysentery and cryptosporidiosis, respectively. In 2013, the CDC tallied 9,056 cases
(up from 2,640 in 2005) of cryptosporidiosis, a reportable
disease in the United States. Two other amebas, Naegleria and Acanthamoeba, cause amebic meningoencephalitis. Because some species of Acanthamoeba can infect the
eye, soft-contact wearers should take precautions to prevent
contamination of their lenses.
The flagellated protozoan Giardia lamblia is a major
cause of diarrhea throughout the world. In the United
States alone, G. lamblia caused 15,106 reported cases of
giardiasis diarrhea in 2013 (over 19,000 in 2010) and likely
caused thousands more that were not reported. G. lamblia
enters a human or other host as a cyst present in drinking water contaminated by feces (Fig. 26.10A). Aside from
humans, G. lamblia can be found in various rodents, deer,
cattle, and even household pets. It is very infectious. Ingestion of as few as 25 cysts can lead to disease. Following
ingestion, the hard, outer coating of the cyst is dissolved
by the action of digestive juices to produce a trophozoite

(Fig. 26.10B), which attaches itself to the wall of the small
intestines and reproduces. Offspring quickly encyst and are
excreted out of the host’s body.
Asymptomatic carriers of G. lamblia are common; it
has been estimated that anywhere from 1% to 30% of children in U.S. day-care centers are carriers. Disease usually
manifests as greasy stools alternating between a watery
diarrhea, loose stools, and constipation. However, some
patients will experience explosive diarrhea. Diagnosis
usually comes from observing the cysts or trophozoite
forms of the protozoan in feces. Metronidazole is a drug
often used to cure the disease. To prevent it in the first
place, proper treatment of community water supplies is
essential.
Although most gastrointestinal disease is intestinal in
locale, specialized microbes can also target the stomach,
with its harsh acidic environment.

Case History: Ulcers—It’s
Not What You Eat

Gary was a 34-year-old accountant who had immigrated
to Nebraska from Poland 7 years earlier. Since his teenage
years, he had been bothered periodically by episodes of epigastric pain (pain around the stomach), nausea, and heartburn.
Antacids usually alleviated the symptoms. Over the years, he
had received several courses of treatment with Tagamet or

Pepcid to reduce acid secretion and provide relief. Recently,
an upper-GI endoscopy had been performed, in which a long,
thin tube tipped with a camera and light source was inserted
into Gary’s mouth and threaded down into his stomach. The
view through the endoscope showed some reddened areas in
the antrum (bottom part) of the stomach. The endoscope was
also equipped with a small clawlike structure that obtained
a small tissue sample from the lining of Gary’s stomach. A
urease test performed on the antral biopsy turned positive in
20 minutes. Histological examination of the biopsy confirmed
moderate chronic active gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining) and revealed the presence of numerous spiralshaped organisms. Cultures of the antral biopsy were positive
for Helicobacter pylori.
Painful and sometimes life-threatening gastric ulcers were
for many years blamed on spicy foods and stress. These
factors were believed to cause increased acid production
that ate away at the stomach lining, even though the gastric mucosa is normally well protected from stomach acid,
which can fall as low as pH 1.5. This protection argued
against the model but was ignored. In the 1980s, after discovering odd, helical bacteria present in the biopsies of gastric ulcers, Australians J. Robin Warren and Barry Marshall
(a medical intern at the Royal Perth Hospital at the time)
(Fig. 26.11A) proposed that bacteria, not pepperoni, cause
ulcers (Fig. 26.11B and C).
Their hypothesis was viewed with skepticism and
declared as heresy by the established medical community.

Faced with disbelief bordering on ridicule, the
young intern drank a vial of the helical organisms and waited. A week later he began vomiting
and suffered other painful symptoms of gastritis.
Barry Marshall could not have been happier. He
had proved his point. We now know that this
curly microbe causes the vast majority of stomach ulcers.
The discovery of Helicobacter pylori and its
association with gastric ulcer disease led to an
upheaval in gastroenterology. Prior to this discovery, treatment had focused on suppressing acid production via proton pump inhibitors,
which did not provide long-term relief. Within
1 year after acid suppression therapy, up to 80%
of patients suffer a relapse of their ulcer. Therapy
now includes antimicrobial treatment to kill the
bacteria and acid suppression therapy to prevent
further inflammation while the ulcer heals. Warren and Marshall, who recovered from his gastritis, received the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology
or Medicine for their groundbreaking work.
The exact mechanism by which H. pylori
causes gastric ulcers is not known, although a
variety of virulence factors have been identified
by gene array (see eAppendix 3) and signaturetagged mutagenesis (see eTopic 25.1). The basic
scheme of Helicobacter pathogenesis is shown
in Fig. 26.12. After the pathogen is ingested,

the mucosa (Fig. 26.12, step 1). As it approaches the
mucosa, the pathogen produces intracellular and extracellular urease, an important virulence factor that converts
urea to CO2 and ammonia. The ammonia neutralizes acid
around Helicobacter and allows the organism to survive
the extreme acidity of the stomach (step 2).
Two other enzymes—collagenase and mucinase—then
soften the mucous lining, which allows the bacteria to reach
the stomach’s epithelial lining (Figs. 26.11C and 26.12,
step 3). The epithelial lining is much less acidic than the
lumen, so the organism can grow and divide. Once at the
epithelium, Helicobacter produces various adhesins, such as
BapA or HpaA, to bind host cells (step 4). After the organism has adhered, tissue damage develops with the release
of vacuolating cytotoxin (VacA) and neutrophil-activating
protein (NAP). NAP activates neutrophils and mast cells to
damage local tissue (step 5). VacA forms a hexameric pore in
the host membrane and induces apoptosis (programmed cell
death) by damaging mitochondria. Apoptotic cells decrease
the immune response, which will stabilize a chronic infection. Another protein, CagA, is injected into host epithelial
cells, where it is phosphorylated; CagA then interacts with
host signaling proteins and activates host signal transduction pathways that can stimulate growth, possibly leading
to cancer (step 6).
Tools useful for diagnosing H. pylori include a fecal antigen test, rapid urease testing, and serology [for example,
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect
antibody to the CagA antigen]. ELISA is a common immunological tool to detect the presence, in serum, of antibodies to a specific organism—an indication of infection. The
assay, described more fully in Section 28.2, is performed by
coating wells in a plastic dish with an antigen (for example,
Helicobacter CagA). Serum from the patient is then added
to the well. If antibodies to CagA are present, they will
bind to the CagA antigen. Unbound antibody is removed
by washing, and a secondary antibody that binds human
IgG is added to the well.
The anti–human IgG antibodies have an enzyme linked
to them. A sandwich is formed as follows: [plastic dish]–
[CagA protein]–[anti-CagA antibody]–[anti-human IgG
antibody]–[enzyme]. When substrate is added to the well,
the enzyme acts on it to produce light or a chromogenic
(colored) product. The more anti-CagA antibody present
in the serum, the more light or product that is produced
by the linked enzyme. Applications of ELISA and further details of the methodology involved are described in
Section 28.2.

also been associated with gastric cancer. Here is some of
the evidence establishing the connection:
■

Many individuals with gastric cancer are also colonized
by H. pylori.

■

Gerbils infected with H. pylori develop gastric cancer.

■

Human gastric cells infected with H. pylori downregulate genes required for DNA repair.

■

When injected into gastric epithelial cells, H. pylori CagA is
phosphorylated on a tyrosine residue and activates a regulatory cascade that causes the gastric cell to proliferate.

The link between H. pylori and gastric cancer is sobering
when you consider that H. pylori can be detected in about
two-thirds of the world’s population, especially in impoverished countries.
We have examined in this section only a handful of the
bacterial, viral, and protozoan microbes that cause gastrointestinal infection. Others are listed in Table 26.3 and are
described in Chapter 20.

Diarrhea leads to dehydration, for which fluid replacement is a critical treatment. Antibiotic treatment is usually not recommended.
Staphylococcal food poisoning is not an infection. It is
a toxigenic disease.
Antibiotic treatments can sometimes cause gastrointestinal disease (for example, pseudomembranous
enterocolitis by Clostridium difficile).
The presence of red and white blood cells in fecal
contents is an indication of invasive bacterial infection
by intracellular pathogens such as Shigella, Salmonella,
and EIEC. Bacteria that do not invade intestinal cells
usually produce watery diarrhea. EHEC is an exception:
the attachment and effacing lesions it produces result in
bloody stools.
Bacterial toxins produced by bacterial enteric pathogens can cause systemic symptoms.
Rotavirus is still the single greatest cause of diarrhea
worldwide. Increasing use of rotavirus vaccine may eventually leave norovirus as the world’s leading cause of diarrhea.
Giardia lamblia is a major protozoan cause of diarrhea
worldwide.
The bacterium Helicobacter pylori, a common cause of
gastric ulcers, lives in the stomach and is highly acid resistant.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Genitourinary
Tract Infections

Although the genital and urinary tracts are different organ
systems with different purposes (procreation versus the filtering and excretion of waste products from blood), the close
association of these organ systems in the body has often led
them to be grouped together when discussing infections.
Note that viruses and bacteria are capable of infecting the
genital tract, but viruses rarely cause urinary tract infections.
Also, very few pathogens can infect both organ systems.

■

Deposition of bacteria from the bloodstream to the
kidney. Kidney infections (called pyelonephritis) can
arise when microorganisms from infections elsewhere in
the body disseminate via the bloodstream.

■

Descending infection from the kidney to the bladder.
Descending infection occurs when bacteria from an
infected kidney are shed into the ureters. The microbes
are then carried by urine into the bladder.

■

Ascending infection to the kidney. In ascending infection, bacteria from an established infection in the bladder ascend along the ureter to infect the kidney.
Thought Question

Urinary Tract Infections

The urinary tract includes the kidneys, ureters, urinary
bladder, and urethra. Infections anywhere along this route
are called urinary tract infections (UTIs). UTIs are the second most common type of bacterial infection in humans,
ranking in frequency just behind respiratory infections
such as bronchitis or pneumonia. In the United States,
bladder infections and other UTIs result in over 6 million
patient visits annually, mostly by women. Estimates are
that at least 25% of women between 20 and 40 years of age
have experienced a UTI, and 20%–40% of those infected
develop recurrent infections. UTIs result in 100,000 hospital admissions in the United States and $1.6 billion in
medical expenses each year.
Urine, as produced in the kidneys, is normally sterile and
was thought to be sterile when stored in the bladder. Studies now show that the bladder has a normal microbiome,
although its role in human health is unclear. Why didn’t we
notice this earlier? All known bacterial causes of urinary tract
infections are facultative anaerobes that grow under aerobic
conditions. The microbiota of our urinary bladder are anaerobic and do not grow when urine is plated aerobically on blood
agar—the normal procedure used to identify urinary tract
pathogens. The current thought that bladder microbiota do
not cause disease and do not grow under the conditions used
to identify uropathogens is convenient for the clinical laboratory seeking pathogens.
Bacteria that cause UTIs are introduced into the bladder
or kidney in one of four ways:
■

Infection from the urethra to the bladder. This is
the most common route for bladder infections (called
cystitis). Bacteria residing along the superficial urogenital membranes of the urethra can ascend to the bladder. This is a more common occurrence in women than
in men. Uropathogenic bacteria colonizing the urethra
can also be introduced into the bladder by means of
mechanical devices such as catheters or cystoscopes that
are passed through the urethra into the bladder.

26.4 Why do you think most urinary tract infections occur in
women?

Urine is bacteriostatic to most of the commensal organisms inhabiting the perineum and vagina, such as Lactobacillus, Corynebacterium, diphtheroids, and Staphylococcus
epidermidis. In contrast, many Gram-negative organisms
thrive in urine. As a result, most urinary tract infections are
caused by facultative Gram-negative rods from the GI tract.
The most common etiological agents of UTIs are:
■

Certain serotypes of E. coli that comprise the uropathogenic E. coli (75% of all UTIs)

■

Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter (20%)

■

Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, Chlamydia, fungi,
Staphylococcus saprophiticus, other (5%)

Case History: Classic
Urinary Tract Infection

Lashandra was 24 years old and had been experiencing back
pain, increased frequency of urination, and dysuria (painful
or burning urination) over the previous 3 days. This was the
first time Lashandra had ever suffered from persisting dysuria. She consulted her general practitioner, who requested
a midstream specimen of urine. Upon microscopic examination, the urine was found to contain more than 50 leukocytes
per microliter (normal is fewer than 5) and 35 red blood cells
per microliter (normal is 3–20). No epithelial squamous cells
(skin cells) were seen, indicating a well-collected midstream
catch. The urine culture plated on agar medium yielded
more than 105 colonies per milliliter (meaning more than 105
organisms per milliliter in the urine) of a facultative anaerobic Gram-negative bacillus capable of fermenting lactose.
The first question to ask in this case is whether the patient
had a significant UTI. The purpose of the midstream urine

collection is to provide laboratory data to make this determination. Even though urine in the bladder is normally
considered sterile (see above), urine becomes contaminated
with normal skin or GI microbiota that may adhere to the
urethral wall. In a midstream collection, the patient urinates briefly, stops to position a collection jar, and resumes
urinating to collect a midstream sample. This procedure
minimizes the number of organisms in the sample by washing away organisms clinging to the urethra before actually
collecting the sample. Nevertheless, the collected sample
will still contain low numbers of organisms representing
normal microbiota of the urethra.
A diagnosis of cystitis can be made in a symptomatic
patient when the number of bacteria (single colony type)
in a sample is at least 1,000/ml. The number of bacteria
per milliliter of urine does not have to reach 105 to diagnose cystitis. In fact, some people (especially the elderly)
are asymptomatic yet have bacterial counts of 105/ml.
These patients have asymptomatic bacteriuria and are not
usually treated with antibiotics, unless they are pregnant
women. The patient in the case history is symptomatic
and has sufficient numbers of bacteria in her urine to indicate a UTI.
The laboratory found the organism to be a Gramnegative bacillus that ferments lactose, suggesting E. coli as
the likely culprit. Given that the normal habitat of E. coli is
the gastrointestinal tract and this is the first UTI suffered
by the patient, the infection is likely the result of an inadvertent introduction of the microbe into the urethra. The
organism makes its way up the urethra and into the bladder. Another way the bladder can become infected is via a
descending route from the kidney. Organisms from a kidney that was infected as a result of sepsis can descend along
a ureter to cause a bladder infection.
Gram-negative rods not only thrive in urine but may
be adapted to cause urinary tract infections through specialized pili. These pili have terminal receptors for glycolipids and glycoproteins present on urinary tract epithelial
cells (Fig. 26.13A). Uropathogenic strains of E. coli, for
example, typically have P-type pili, with a terminal receptor
for the P antigen (a rather appropriate name for a bladderspecific virulence factor). The P antigen is a blood group
marker found on the surface of cells lining the perineum
and urinary tract; it is expressed by approximately 75% of
the population. These individuals are particularly susceptible to UTIs.
Some patients, usually women, are also susceptible

UTIs resolve spontaneously, but others can progress to
destroy the kidney or, via Gram-negative septicemia, the
host. As a result, antibiotic therapy is recommended. In older
patients, UTIs frequently show atypical symptoms, including delirium, which disappears when the UTI is treated.

Thought Question

26.5 Urine samples collected from six hospital patients
were placed on a table at the nurses’ station awaiting pickup
from the microbiology lab. Several hours later, a courier
retrieved the samples and transported them to the lab. The
next day, the lab reported that four of the six patients had
UTIs. Would you consider these results reliable? Would you
start treatment based on these results?

What makes uropathogenic E. coli different from other
strains of E. coli? This is a question still under investigation,
but genomic analysis has exposed five pathogenicity islands
unique to these strains (Fig. 26.13B). The functions of
these pathogenicity islands are still under investigation.

Sexually Transmitted Diseases

Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are defined as infections transmitted primarily through sexual contact, which
may include genital, oral-genital, or anal-genital contact.
The organisms or viruses involved are generally very susceptible to drying and require direct physical contact with
mucous membranes for transmission. Because sex can take

many forms in addition to intercourse, these microbes
can initiate disease in the urogenital tract, rectum, or oral
cavities. Condoms can prevent transmission but do so, of
course, only when used. Examples of common sexually
transmitted diseases are listed in Table 26.4.

Case History: Secondary Syphilis

A pregnant 18-year-old woman came to the county urgentcare clinic with a low-grade fever, malaise, and headache.
She was sent home with a diagnosis of influenza. She again
sought treatment 7 days later, after she discovered a macular rash (flat, red) developing on her trunk, arms, palms of
her hands, and soles of her feet. Further questioning of the
patient revealed that 1 year earlier, she had had a painless
ulcer on her vagina that healed spontaneously. She was diagnosed with secondary syphilis—a diagnosis confirmed by a
serological test. She was given a single intramuscular injection of penicillin and told that her sexual partners had to be
treated as well.
The vaginal ulcer, the long latent period, and secondary
development of rash on the hands and feet described in the

case history are classic symptoms of syphilis. Syphilis was
recognized as a disease as early as the sixteenth century,
but the organism responsible, the spirochete Treponema
pallidum, was not discovered until 1905 (Fig. 26.14A).
(Chapter 18 describes spirochete structure.) The illness
has several stages. The disease has often been called the
great imitator because its symptoms in the second stage,
as exhibited in the case history, can mimic many other diseases. The incubation stage can last from 2 to 6 weeks after
transmission, during which time the organism multiplies
and spreads throughout the body.
Primary syphilis is an inflammatory reaction at the site
of infection called a chancre (Fig. 26.14B). About a centimeter in diameter, the chancre is painless and hard, and it
contains spirochetes. Patients are usually too embarrassed
to seek medical attention and, because it is painless, hope
it will just go away. It does go away after several weeks,
and without scarring. The disease has now entered the primary latent stage. Over the next 5 years, symptoms may be
absent, but at any time, as described in the case history, the
infected person can develop the rash typical of secondary
syphilis (Fig. 26.14C). The rash can be similar to rashes
produced by many different diseases, which contributes
to the “great imitator” label. The patient remains contagious in this stage. The symptoms eventually resolve, and
the patient reenters a latent phase of syphilis. Some patients
eventually progress over years to tertiary syphilis and
develop many of the cardiovascular and nervous system–
associated symptoms. Neurological symptoms resulting
from syphilis at any stage of the disease are referred to as
neurosyphilis. The patient can develop dementia and eventually dies from the disease.
The presence of T. pallidum in tissues can be detected
with fluorescent antibody, but the initial screen is usually
serological (that is, patient serum is tested for antibodies).
Antibiotics are useful for eradicating the organism, but
there is no vaccine, and cure does not confer immunity.

The disease is particularly dangerous in pregnant women.
The treponeme can cross the placental barrier and infect
the fetus to cause congenital syphilis. At birth, infected
newborns will have notched teeth (visible on X-rays), perforated palates, and other congenital defects. Women should
be screened for syphilis as part of their prenatal testing to
prevent these congenital infections.
Columbus and the New World theory of syphilis. An out-

break of syphilis that spread throughout Europe soon after
Christopher Columbus and his crew returned from the
Americas (1493) led to the theory that Columbus brought
the treponeme to Europe from the New World. However,
the theory that Columbus brought syphilis to Europe has
been difficult to prove.
Kristin Harper and colleagues used a phylogenetic
approach to address the 500-year-old question. The group
sequenced 26 geographically disparate strains of pathogenic Treponema. Of all the strains examined, the sexually transmitted syphilis-causing strains originated most
recently and were more closely related to the nonsexually
transmitted yaws-causing strains from South America, supporting the New World theory of syphilis. Thus, it seems
the crew of the Columbus voyages brought smallpox and
measles to America and did, in fact, return to Europe with
syphilis.
The Tuskegee experiment. Unfortunately, much of what
we know about syphilis is the result of the infamous
Tuskegee experiment conducted in the 1930s in Alabama.
The study was entitled “Untreated Syphilis in the Negro
Male.” Through dubious means and deception, a group of
African-American males was enlisted in a study that promised treatment but whose real purpose was to observe how
the disease progressed without treatment. Today, such
experiments are barred, thanks to strict oversight by institutional review boards (IRBs) that require human subjects

discharge. The organism produced characteristic colonies on
chocolate agar (agar plates containing heat-lysed red blood
cells that turn the medium chocolate brown) (Fig. 26.16B).
The case was subsequently reported to the state public health
department. When the patient came back for his return visit,
his symptoms had resolved, and a repeat culture was negative.
The disease here is classic gonorrhea caused by Neisseria
gonorrhoeae. A characteristic that distinguishes Neisseria
infections from Chlamydia infections is that bacterial cells
are seen in gonorrheal discharges but not in chlamydial discharges. Gonorrhea has been a problem for centuries and
remains epidemic in this country today. Symptoms generally occur 2–7 days after infection, but they can take as long
as 30 days to develop. Most infected men exhibit symptoms; only about 10%–15% do not. Symptoms include painful urination, yellowish white discharge from the penis,
and in some cases, swelling of the testicles and penis. The
Greek physician Galen (AD 129–ca. 199) originally mistook the discharge for semen. This mistake led to the name
gonorrhea, which means “flow of seed.”
In contrast to men, most infected women (80%) do not
exhibit symptoms and constitute the major reservoir of the
organism. If they are asymptomatic, they have no reason
to seek treatment and thus can spread the disease. When
symptoms are present, they are usually mild. A symptomatic
woman will experience a painful burning sensation when
urinating and will notice vaginal discharge that is yellow
or occasionally bloody. She may also complain of cramps or
pain in her lower abdomen, sometimes with fever or nausea. As the infection spreads throughout the reproductive
organs (uterus and fallopian tubes), pelvic inflammatory
disease occurs (see earlier discussion of chlamydia). There
is no serological test or vaccine for gonorrhea, because the
organism frequently changes the structure of its surface

antigens (phase variation is discussed in Section 10.1 and
eTopic 10.1).
Although N. gonorrhoeae is generally serum sensitive,
owing to its sensitivity to complement, certain serum-resistant strains can make their way to the bloodstream and carry
infection throughout the body. As a result, both sexes can
develop purulent arthritis (joint fluid containing pus), endocarditis, or meningitis. An infected mother can also infect
her newborn during parturition (birth), leading to a serious
eye infection called ophthalmia neonatorum. Because of this
risk and because most infected women are asymptomatic, all
newborns receive antimicrobial eyedrops at birth.
Because adults engage in a variety of sexual practices,
N. gonorrhoeae can also infect the anus or the pharynx,
where it can develop into a mild sore throat. These infections generally remain unrecognized until a sex partner
presents with a more typical form of genitourinary gonorrhea. Because no lasting immunity is built up, reinfection with N. gonorrhoeae is possible. Reinfection occurs
in part because there is phase variation in various surface
antigens and because the organism can apparently bind to
CD4+ T cells, inhibiting their activation and proliferation
to become memory T cells (Fig. 26.16C).
Over the decades, N. gonorrhoeae has incrementally
developed resistance to many antibiotics used in its treatment, but there has always been a new, effective drug ready
to take the place of the old drug. Soon, this may no longer be the case. To prevent treatment failures, the CDC
recommends dual antibiotic therapy that includes an intramuscular injection of ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin or
tetracycline. However, the incidence of ceftriaxone-resistant
strains of N. gonorrhoeae overseas is increasing. The alarm
has been raised that new antibiotics must be developed if
we are to prevent an uncontrollable explosion of cases of
this already epidemic disease.

HIV Causes AIDS, a Sexually
Transmitted and Blood-Borne Disease

Though HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is believed
to have originated around the year 1900, it was not discovered until 1981, when the virus caused the greatest pandemic of the late twentieth century. HIV remains a serious
problem today, especially in southern Africa, where it is estimated that 10%–30% of the population is infected (prevalence in the United States is less than 1%). HIV has claimed
the lives of almost 2 million people per year worldwide
(about 14,000 per year in the United States). You may be
surprised to learn that in the United States, women make
up about 19% of new AIDS cases per year, the majority

resulting from heterosexual sex. The molecular biology and
virulence of HIV are discussed in Chapters 11 and 25, and
pathogenesis is covered in eTopic 26.5. This section focuses
on the disease that HIV causes—namely, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
HIV, a lentivirus in the retroviral family, is a prominent
example of viruses that can be transmitted either sexually
(vaginally, orally, anally—homosexually or heterosexually)
or through direct contact with body fluids, such as occurs
with blood transfusion or the sharing of hypodermic needles by intravenous drug users. HIV is not transmitted by
kissing, tears, or mosquito bites. It can, however, be transferred from mother to fetus through the placenta (transplacental transfer). We discuss HIV infections in this section
because sexual contact remains the major route of transmission. Figure 26.17A shows the worldwide decrease
in the number of newly infected HIV patients and deaths
due to AIDS. The number of people living with HIV has
increased, however, because of the development of more
effective antiviral treatments. The pathogenesis of HIV
and the proportion of AIDS cases by sex and ethnicity are
described in eTopic 26.5.

CHAPTER 26

Once it has entered the bloodstream, HIV infects CD4+
T cells and macrophages (which also have CD4 on their
surface). The virus replicates very rapidly, producing a billion particles per day. The virus can also spread directly
from cell to cell via virological synapses (Fig. 26.17B).
When infected and uninfected T cells make contact, HIV
virions and mitochondria (to supply energy) line up at the
contact interface where transmission occurs. Viral replication starts to kill the CD4+ T cells, which progressively
decrease in number.
HIV infection has four stages.
1. A primary stage beginning with seroconversion (finding antibodies to the virus)
2. Clinical latency (slow steady loss of T cells without
symptoms, or sometimes swollen lymph nodes)
3. Early symptomatic disease (formerly called AIDSrelated complex)
4. Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)
Symptoms in the early symptomatic stage can include fever,
headache, macular rash, and weight loss. The symptoms can
manifest within a few months of infection, resolve within a
few weeks, and then recur. As T-cell numbers decline, the
debilitated immune system leaves the victim susceptible to
secondary infections such as thrush, caused by the yeast Candida albicans (candidiasis) and related species (Fig. 26.17C).
The CDC defines AIDS as a CD4+ cell count of less
than 200 cells/μl or the presence of an AIDS indicator
disease. For example, once the CD4+ T-cell population
falls below 500 cells/μl, opportunistic infections start to
arise and disease processes begin. Opportunistic infections
include pneumonia by Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare
or Pneumocystis jirovecii (Fig. 26.17D), cryptococcal meningitis, Histoplasma capsulatum infection, and tuberculosis. The presence of these diseases indicates that the patient
has AIDS, regardless of the CD4+ count.
Various cancers are also on the list of AIDS indicator diseases. AIDS patients are more susceptible to cancers because
their depressed immune systems cannot detect and destroy
cancer cells generated by secondary agents. Kaposi’s sarcoma
(Fig. 26.17E), for instance, is a common cancer seen in
AIDS patients that is caused by human herpes virus type
8 (HHV8). Kaposi’s sarcoma originates in endothelial or
lymphatic cells, but the resulting tumors can develop anywhere—gastrointestinal tract, mouth, lungs, skin, or brain.
Diagnosis of AIDS involves detecting anti-HIV antibodies and determining the CD4+ T-cell count in a patient.
An assay for HIV to determine viral load is done via quantitative PCR to detect HIV-specific genes such as gag, nef, or
pol. Remember, a person who is HIV-positive does not necessarily have AIDS; the disease may take years to develop.
A vaccine is not yet available to prevent AIDS, in part

because the envelope proteins of the virus (see Fig. 11.24)
typically change their antigenic shape. However, progression of the disease can be controlled by antiretroviral drugs
that inhibit two HIV enzymes critical to the replication of
the virus: reverse transcriptase and protease. Antiretroviral
drugs are discussed further in Chapter 27.
New treatment regimens (HAART; see Chapter 27) have
made HIV an increasingly survivable infection. Consider this:
In the past, nearly all HIV-infected individuals eventually
became ill and died from AIDS-related diseases, but in the
United States at least half of, if not most, HIV-positive people
now die from diseases unrelated to HIV (for example, heart
attack). Because HIV infection is now considered a treatable
disease, the CDC recommends routine screening for HIV.
Can HIV infection be cure d? Because HIV DNA integrates into the genome of an infected cell, it has been
impossible to cure anyone of the infection. However, a new
study by Kamel Khalili has proved that the CRISPR-cas9
system described in Chapters 9 and 12 can be engineered
to “surgically” remove proviral HIV DNA from infected
T cells. Whether this strategy can be used in a patient
remains to be seen.
Thought Question

26.7 Like the cause of plague, HIV is a blood-borne disease.
Why, then, do fleas and mosquitoes fail to transmit HIV?

The Protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis
Produces a Common Vaginal Infection

Trichomonas vaginalis is a flagellated protozoan
(Fig. 26.18) that causes an unpleasant sexually transmitted vaginal disease called trichomoniasis. Approximately
2–3 million infections occur each year in the United States.
Both men and women can be infected; however, men
are usually asymptomatic. Even among infected women,
25%–50% are considered asymptomatic carriers.
There is no cyst in the life cycle of T. vaginalis, so
transmission is via the trophozoite stage only (the form
of a protozoan in the feeding stage). The female patient
with trichomoniasis may complain of vaginal itching and/
or burning and a musty vaginal odor. An abnormal vaginal discharge also may be present. Males will complain of
painful urination (dysuria), urethral or testicular pain, and
lower abdominal pain.
Owing to colonization by lactobacilli (which produce
large amounts of acidic lactic acid), the normal, healthy
vagina has a pH of less than 4.5. However, since T. vaginalis feeds on bacteria, the pH of the vagina rises as the numbers of lactobacilli decrease. Definitive diagnosis requires
demonstrating by microscopy that the flagellated protozoan is in secretions. PMNs, which are the primary host

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) include cystitis (bladder) and pyelonephritis (kidney). E. coli is the most common cause of UTIs.
Cystitis can develop from bacteria ascending up the
urethra (most common route) or descending down a
ureter from an infected kidney.
Pyelonephritis can develop from bacteria ascending
along a ureter from an infected bladder or from bacteria in the bloodstream disseminating from an infection
elsewhere in the body.
Syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea are the most common sexually transmitted diseases.
A patient with one sexually transmitted disease often
has another sexually transmitted disease too.
Complement prevents bloodstream dissemination of
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which lacks a carbohydrate capsule. Because the organism frequently changes the structure of its surface antigens, no vaccine is available for N.
gonorrhoeae.
HIV depletion of CD4+ T cells results in lethal secondary infections and cancers.

Cardiovascular and
Systemic Infections

The cardiovascular system, which is composed of the heart,
arteries, veins, and capillaries, delivers oxygen, nutrients,
and immune system components to all tissues of the body.
There are pathogens that can directly infect the heart or
the endothelial cells lining blood vessels. However, the
blood itself can also become infected or serve as a mass
transit system to spread pathogens throughout the body.
Pathogens disseminated in this way can cause infections in
many different organ systems. We will examine both types
of infections in this section.
Infections of the cardiovascular system include septicemia, endocarditis (inflammation of the heart’s inner
lining), pericarditis (inflammation of the heart’s outer lining), myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscle), and, possibly, atherosclerosis (deposition of fatty substances along
the inner lining of arteries; eTopic 26.6). These are all lifethreatening diseases.
Septicemia is, by strict definition, the presence of bacteria
or viruses in the blood. The presence of viruses is a condition
more specifically called viremia, while bacteria in the circulation is more specifically called bacteremia. In practice,
however, the terms “septicemia” and “bacteremia” are often
used interchangeably. Septicemia can develop from a local
tissue infection situated anywhere in the body, although
blood factors such as complement can nonspecifically kill
many types of bacteria that enter the blood. Nevertheless,
Gram-positives, Gram-negatives, aerobes, and anaerobes can
all produce septicemia under the right conditions.
Endocarditis can be either viral or bacterial in origin.
It can be a consequence of many bacterial diseases, such
as brucellosis, gonorrhea, psittacosis, staphylococcal and
streptococcal infections, candidiasis, and Q fever (Coxiella).
Among the many viral causes are coxsackievirus, echovirus,
Epstein-Barr virus, and HIV. Bacterial infections of the
heart are always serious. Viral infections, although common, are rarely life-threatening in healthy individuals and
are usually asymptomatic.

Case History: Bacterial Endocarditis

Elizabeth was 38 years old and had a history of mitral valve
prolapse (a common congenital condition in which a heart
valve does not close properly). She was also on immunosuppressive
therapy following a kidney transplant. Recently, Elizabeth was
admitted to the hospital complaining of fatigue, intermittent

fevers for 5 weeks, and headaches for 3 weeks—symptoms the physician recognized as possible indications of endocarditis. Elizabeth reported having a dental procedure a few weeks prior to the
onset of symptoms. A sample of her blood placed in a liquid bacteriological medium grew Gram-positive cocci, which turned out
to be Streptococcus mutans, a member of the viridans streptococci. With the finding of bacteria in the bloodstream, the diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis was confirmed. Elizabeth began
a 1-month course of intravenous penicillin G and gentamicin
therapy and eventually recovered to normal health.
Endocarditis (inflammation of the heart) is traditionally
classified as acute or subacute, depending on the pathogenic organism involved and the speed of clinical presentation. Subacute bacterial endocarditis (SBE) has a slow
onset with vague symptoms. It is usually caused by bacterial infection of a heart valve (Fig. 26.19). SBE infections
are usually (but not always) caused by a viridans streptococcus from the oral microbiota (for example, Streptococcus mutans, a common cause of dental caries). “Viridans
streptococci” is a general term used for commensal streptococci whose colonies produce green alpha hemolysis on
blood agar (“viridans” is from the Greek viridis, “to be
green”). Most patients who develop infective endocarditis
have mitral valve prolapse (90%), although this is frequently
not the case when patients are intravenous drug abusers or
have hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections.
Subacute bacterial endocarditis can begin at the dentist’s
office, as it did in the case history presented here, although
it very rarely does. Following a dental procedure (such as
tooth restoration) or even while brushing your teeth, oral
bacteria can transiently enter the bloodstream and circulate. S. mutans, which is not normally a serious health
problem, can become lodged onto damaged heart valves,
grow as a biofilm, and secrete a thick glycocalyx coating
that encases the microbes and forms a vegetation on the
valve, damaging it further. If untreated, the condition can
be fatal within 6 weeks to a year.
A rapidly progressive (acute) and highly destructive
infection can develop when more virulent organisms, such
as Staphylococcus aureus, gain access to cardiac tissue. Symptoms of acute endocarditis include fever, pronounced valvular regurgitation (backflow of blood through the valve),
and abscess formation.
Most patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis present with a fever that lasts several weeks. They also complain of nonspecific symptoms, such as cough, shortness of
breath, joint pain, diarrhea, and abdominal or flank pain.
Endocarditis is suspected in any patient who has a heart
murmur and an unexplained fever for at least a week. It
should also be considered in an intravenous drug abuser
with a fever, even in the absence of a murmur. In either
case, definitive diagnosis requires blood cultures that
grow bacteria. Blood cultures involve taking samples of a

patient’s blood from two different locations (such as two
different arms). Once collected, the blood is added to liquid culture medium and incubated at 37°C. Incubation
should be done aerobically and anaerobically. Growth of
the same organism in cultures taken from two body sites
rules out inadvertent contamination with skin microbes,
which would likely yield growth in only one culture.
Curing endocarditis is difficult because the microbes
are usually ensconced in a nearly impenetrable glycocalyx.
Consequently, eradicating microorganisms from the vegetations almost always requires hospitalization, where high
doses of intravenous antibiotic therapy can be administered
and monitored. Antibiotic therapy usually continues for at
least a month, and in extreme cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace the damaged heart valve.
Patients with heart valve prolapse should not shy away
from the dentist, however. As long as a healthy immune
system is in place, the risk of infection is low. In fact, maintaining good oral hygiene can keep their risk of developing infectious endocarditis low. Immunocompromised
patients, on the other hand, are at increased risk and should
be treated prophylactically with oral penicillin or erythromycin 1 hour before a procedure, to kill oral bacteria that
enter the bloodstream. This prophylactic treatment can
prevent the development of endocarditis in these patients.
Viruses such as adenovirus and some enteroviruses can
also cause endocarditis, as well as a condition known as
myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle.

Thought Question

26.8 A patient presenting with high fever and in an extremely
weakened state is suspected of having a septicemia. Two sets
of blood cultures are taken from different arms. One bottle
from each set grows Staphylococcus aureus, yet the laboratory
report states that the results are inconclusive. New blood cultures are ordered. What would make these results inconclusive?

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Malarial Parasites Feed on Blood

Malaria is the most devastating infectious disease known.
Each year, 300–500 million people develop malaria worldwide, and 1–3 million of these people, mostly children,
die. In the United States the disease is relatively rare;
only about 1,000 cases occur annually, and almost all are
acquired as a result of international travel to endemic areas
(Fig. 26.20A). Once again, this correlation illustrates the
diagnostic importance of knowing a patient’s travel history.
The disease is caused by four species of Plasmodium:
P. falciparum (the most deadly), P. malariae, P. vivax, and
P. ovale. The life cycle of Plasmodium, discussed in detail in
Chapter 20, is complex and involves two cycles: an asexual
erythrocytic cycle in the human, and a sexual cycle in the
mosquito (see Fig. 20.39).
In the erythrocytic cycle, the organisms enter the
bloodstream through the bite of an infected female Anopheles mosquito (the mosquito injects a small amount of saliva
containing Plasmodium). The haploid sporozoites travel
immediately to the liver, where they undergo asexual fission to produce merozoites. Released from the liver, the
merozoites attach to and penetrate red blood cells, where
Plasmodium consumes hemoglobin and enlarges into a trophozoite. The protist nucleus divides, so that the cell, now
called a schizont, contains up to 20 or so nuclei. The schizont then divides to make the smaller, haploid merozoites
(Fig. 26.20B). The glutted red blood cell eventually lyses,
releasing merozoites that can infect new red blood cells (see
Fig. 20.39).
Sudden, synchronized release of the merozoites and red
blood cell debris triggers the telltale symptoms of malaria:
violent, shaking chills followed by high fever and sweating.

The erythrocytic cycle, and thus the symptoms, repeats
every 48–72 hours. After several cycles, the patient goes
into remission lasting several weeks to months, after which
there is a relapse.
Much of today’s research focuses on why malarial relapse
happens. Why does the immune system fail to eliminate
the parasite after the first episode? When Plasmodium
invades the red blood cells, it lines the blood cells with a
protein, PfEMP1, which causes the parasite to stick to the
sides of blood vessels. The parasite is thereby removed from
circulation, but the protein cannot protect the parasite
from patrolling macrophages, which eventually detect the
invader and recruit other immune cells to fight it. So, during a malarial infection, a small percentage of each generation of parasites switches to a different version of PfEMP1
that the body has never seen before. In its new disguise,
Plasmodium can invade more red blood cells and cause
another wave of fever, headaches, nausea, and chills.
The antigenic shift happens when the parasite alters
the PfEMP1 gene that is expressed. The body now has to
repeat the recognition and attack responses all over again.
The parasite has 60 cloaking genes, called var, that can be
turned on and off individually, changing the organisms’
antigenic structure, like a criminal repeatedly changing his
disguise to elude police.
The var genes are regulated by chromosome packaging,
which unwraps one gene for expression and packs away the
inactive genes. DNA can be encased so securely by some
proteins that other proteins cannot access the nucleic acid
for transcription—a process known as epigenetic silencing. Becoming immune to all the types of malaria can
take upwards of 5 years and requires constant exposure;

otherwise the immunity is lost. Many children do not live
long enough to gain immunity to malaria in all its forms.
Diagnosis of malaria involves microscopic demonstration of the protist within erythrocytes (Wright stain) or
serology to identify antimalarial antibodies. Treatment
regimens include artemisinin, whose mechanism of action
is unknown; chloroquine or mefloquine, which kill the
organisms in their erythrocytic asexual stages; and primaquine, effective in the exoerythrocytic stages by disrupting
Plasmodium mitochondria.
The chloroquine family of drugs acts by interfering
with the detoxification of heme generated from hemoglobin digestion. Malaria parasites accumulate the hemoglobin released from red blood cells in plasmodial lysosomes,
where digestion occurs. The parasites use the amino acids
from hemoglobin to grow but find free heme toxic. To prevent eating itself to death (from accumulating too much
heme), the organism detoxifies heme via polymerization,
which produces a black pigment. Many antimalarial drugs,
such as chloroquine, prevent polymerization by binding to
the heme. As a result, the increased iron level (from heme)
kills the parasite. Unfortunately, Plasmodium has been
developing resistance to these drugs, forcing the development of new ones.

An effective vaccine has so far proved elusive because of
the antigenic shape-shifting carried out by this parasite. To
prevent infection, antimalarial drugs are given prophylactically to persons traveling to endemic areas. Which drug is
given depends on the destination.
Bear in mind that we have described only selected organisms that cause cardiovascular infections; there are many
more (for example, Rickettsia typhi). There is even evidence
that Chlamydophila pneumoniae may have a role in coronary artery disease (see eTopic 26.6).

Note:

Babesiosis is an emerging disease caused by a protozoan (Babesia microti) that, like Plasmodium, infects red blood
cells. B. microti is transmitted by the deer tick, the same insect that
transmits the agent for Lyme disease. Typically, babesiosis is a mild,
flu-like disease, but in its severe form it can present with symptoms
similar to those of malaria.

Systemic Infections

Many pathogenic bacteria can produce septicemia as a
way to disseminate throughout the body and infect other
organs. These organisms cause what are considered systemic infections.

even prairie dogs (Fig. 26.21C), by the bite of infected
fleas. Figure 26.22 illustrates the various infective cycles
of the plague bacillus. Humans are not typically part of the
natural infection cycle. However, in the absence of an animal host, the flea can take a blood meal from humans and
thereby transmit the disease to them. During the Middle
Ages, urban rats venturing back and forth to the countryside became infected by the fleas of wild rodents that
served as a reservoir. Upon returning to the city, the rat flea
passed the organism on to other rats, which then died in
droves. The rat fleas, deprived of their normal meal, were
forced to feed on city dwellers, passing the disease on to
them.
Individuals bitten by an infected flea or accidentally
infected through a cut while skinning an infected animal
first exhibit the symptoms of bubonic plague. Bubonic
plague emerges as the organism moves from the site of
infection to the lymph nodes, producing characteristically
enlarged nodes called buboes (see Fig. 26.21A). From the
lymph nodes, the pathogen can enter the bloodstream,
causing septicemic plague. In this phase the patient can
go into shock from the massive amount of endotoxin in
the bloodstream. Neither bubonic nor septicemic plague

staining (Fig. 26.21B). The patient’s white blood cell count
was 24,700/μl (normal is 5,000–10,000/μl), and his platelet count was 72,000/μl (normal is 130,000–400,000/μl). In
the 2 weeks prior to becoming ill, the patient had trapped,
killed, and skinned two prairie dogs, four coyotes, and one
bobcat. The patient had cut his left hand shortly before skinning a prairie dog. PCR and typical biochemical testing of
a Gram-negative rod isolated from blood cultures identified the organism as Yersinia pestis, the organism that causes
plague. The patient received an antibiotic cocktail of gentamicin and tetracycline. He eventually recovered, after
6 weeks in intensive care.
Plague is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, which can
infect both humans and animals. During the Middle Ages,
the disease, known as the Black Death, decimated over a
third of the population of Europe. Such was the horror it
evoked that invading armies would actually catapult dead
plague victims into embattled fortresses. This was probably
the first reported case of biowarfare.
Y. pestis is present in the United States and is endemic
in 17 western states. The microbe is normally transmitted from animal to animal, typically rodents like rats and
FIGURE 26.22

■ The cycles of plague. The sylvatic cycle occurs
in the wild, where fleas transmit the organism between rodents. An
accidental interaction with urban rats can trigger a similar urban cycle.
Humans can be infected through contact with infected fleas coming from
either cycle. Flea bite transmission initiates bubonic plague symptoms
that can progress to pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is highly
infectious, which can cause epidemic spread of the disease.

is passed from person to person. As the organism courses
through the bloodstream, however, it will invade the lungs
and produce pneumonic plague (Fig. 26.21D), which can
be easily transmitted from person to person through aerosol droplets generated by coughing.
Pneumonic plague is the most dangerous form of
the disease because it can kill quickly and spread rapidly
through a population. Pneumonic plague is so virulent
that an untreated patient can die within 24–48 hours.
The organism is usually identified postmortem. It is now
thought that the rapid spread of plague during the Middle Ages was the result of person-to-person transmission
through respiratory aerosols.
Y. pestis has numerous virulence factors. For instance,
YadA is a surface adhesin that binds collagen. Another
factor, the F1 protein capsule surface antigen, plays a
part in blocking phagocytosis in mammalian hosts. Certain biofilms formed by Y. pestis are also important. An
extracellular matrix synthesized by Y. pestis produces an
adherent biofilm in the flea midgut that contributes to
flea-to-mammal transmission. The biofilm blocks flea
digestion, making the flea feel “starved” even after a
blood meal. Therefore, the flea jumps from host to host
in a futile effort to feel full. As the flea tries to take a
blood meal, the blockage causes the insect to regurgitate
bacteria into the wound. This curious effect of Y. pestis on the insect vector is another unique aspect of how
plague spreads so quickly.
Y. pestis also uses type III secretion systems to inject virulence proteins (YopB and YopD) into host cell membranes.
Unlike Salmonella, which uses type III–secreted proteins
to gain entrance into host cells, Y. pestis is not primarily
an intracellular pathogen, although it can survive in macrophages. Injection of the Yop proteins disrupts the actin
cytoskeleton and so helps the organism evade phagocytosis. By evading phagocytosis, the organism avoids triggering an inflammatory response and produces massive tissue
colonization.
Plague has disappeared from Europe; the last major
outbreak occurred in 1772. The reason for its disappearance is not known, but it was probably the result of multiple factors, not the least of which was human intervention.
Although it wasn’t until the nineteenth century that doctors understood how germs could cause disease, Europeans recognized by the sixteenth century that plague was
contagious and could be carried from one area to another.
Beginning in the late seventeenth century, governments
created a medical boundary, or cordon sanitaire, between
Europe and the areas to the east from which epidemics
came. Ships traveling west from the Ottoman Empire were
forced to wait in quarantine before passengers and cargo
could be unloaded. Those who attempted to evade medical
quarantine were shot.

Sepsis and Toxic Shock

Many bacterial pathogens can, under the right circumstances, infect the bloodstream to cause septicemia and
ultimately sepsis; a life-threatening condition involving
high fever, high white blood cell counts, rapid heart rate,
and/or rapid breathing. The offending bacteria are typically found in the blood (see Chapter 28). Organisms that
can cause sepsis include Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia
coli, Enterococcus species, and many others including Yersinia pestis from the preceding case. In severe cases sepsis
can progress to septic shock in which the patient’s blood
pressure drops to dangerous levels.

Case History: Toxic Shock

In May 2013, a visibly ill 16-year-old girl was taken to her
pediatrician, where she complained of diarrhea, high fever
(39.9°C; 103.8°F), and vomiting. She told the physician she had
been healthy until 2 days prior. Upon physical exam, the doctor
noticed that the girl had a much lower than normal blood pressure (76/48 mm Hg; normal range 90–130/60–90), a rapid
heart rate (120 beats per minute; normal range 60–100), and
an erythematous (red) rash on her trunk. These are all signs of
septic shock. Because of her deteriorating condition, the patient
was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit at the local
hospital. However, blood cultures revealed no bacteria. She was
immediately given intravenous fluids and IV antibiotics. The
girl rallied and left the hospital one week later. Patient history taken upon admission revealed that the girl had started
her menstrual period 4 days before becoming ill, providing an
important clue as to the cause of the disease.
This potential tragedy reflects a larger story that emerged
in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when women started
dying from this dangerous, new (emerging) disease, now
known as toxic shock syndrome. Scientists and physicians
learned that it is caused by certain strains of Staphylococcus aureus that produce a superantigen type of toxin (toxic
shock syndrome toxin, or TSST; see Section 24.3). Why
had the disease not been recognized in previous decades?
The answer turned out to be the use of one brand of
superabsorbent tampons (since removed from the market).
The tampons produced a rich growth environment for S.
aureus. So, if the patient was colonized by a TSST-producing strain, huge amounts of toxin were released to circulate
in the bloodstream.
Even though the superabsorbent tampons are no longer
available, toxic shock syndrome is still sometimes associated with menstruation, as in the case history. Today, however, we recognize that toxic shock syndrome is a possible
consequence of any S. aureus infection and can occur in
both men and women. TSST-producing S. aureus can cause

an infection anywhere in the body. The organisms secrete
the toxin, which disseminates rapidly through the circulation to cause generalized, potentially lethal symptoms.
Knowledge that a protein toxin was responsible for the
disease led to a recommendation that treatment of toxic
shock syndrome include the antibiotic clindamycin. As
you will learn in Chapter 27, clindamycin is an inhibitor
of bacterial protein synthesis. By blocking protein synthesis, clindamycin decreased the amount of TSST made, while
other antibiotics (vancomycin, for instance) killed the pathogen. The combination saved the girl’s life. In Chapter 25 we
discuss the weapons that microbes use to cause disease.

Case History: Lyme Disease

Brad, a 9-year-old from Connecticut, developed a fever and
a large (8-cm) reddish rash with a clear center (erythema
migrans) on his trunk (Fig. 26.23A). He also had some

left-facial-nerve palsy. Brad had returned a week previously
from a Boy Scout camping trip to the local woods, where he had
done a lot of hiking. When asked by his physician, Brad admitted finding a tick on his stomach while in the woods but thinking little of it. The doctor ordered serological tests for Borrelia
burgdorferi (the organism that causes Lyme disease), Rickettsia
rickettsii (which produces Rocky Mountain spotted fever), and
Ehrlichia equi (which causes ehrlichiosis). The ELISA test for B.
burgdorferi came back positive, confirming a diagnosis of Lyme
disease. The boy was given a 3-week regimen of doxycycline (a
tetracycline derivative), which resolved the rash and palsy.
Lyme arthritis was first reported in Lyme, Connecticut, in
the 1970s, but the causative organism, Borrelia burgdorferi,

CHAPTER 26

was not identified until 1982. Since then, Lyme disease (a
form of borreliosis) has become the most common vector-borne illness in the United States and is considered an
emerging infectious disease. The main endemic areas are
the northeastern coastal area from Massachusetts to Maryland, Wisconsin and Minnesota, and northern California and Oregon. Lyme disease is also common in parts of
Europe.
B. burgdorferi is a spirochete (Fig. 26.23B) transmitted to humans by ixodid ticks (hard ticks) (Fig. 26.23C
and D). In the northeastern and central United States,
where most cases occur, the deer tick Ixodes scapularis
transmits the spirochete, usually during the summer
months. In the western United States, I. pacificus is the
tick vector.
During its nymphal stage (the stage after taking its first
blood meal), I. scapularis is the size of a poppy seed. Its
bite is painless, so it is easily overlooked. Infection takes
place when the tick feeds, because the spirochete is regurgitated into the host. However, the organism grows in the
tick’s digestive tract and takes about 2 days to make its way
to the tick’s salivary gland, so if the tick is removed before
that time, the patient will not be infected. Once it is transferred to the human, the microbe can travel rapidly via the
bloodstream to any area in the body, but it prefers to grow
in skin, nerve tissue, synovium (joint lining), and the conduction system of the heart.
Lyme disease has three stages. Similar to syphilis caused

by the spirochete Treponema palidum, there are three general stages of Lyme disease. Stage 1 involves the localized
spread of Borrelia burgdorferi between 3 and 30 days after
the initial exposure. Approximately 75% of patients experience an erythema migrans rash, usually at the site of the
tick bite. The appearance of the rash varies but is classically
erythematous with central clearing (“bull’s-eye” rash). This
stage is often associated with constitutional symptoms such
as fever, myalgia (muscle pain), arthralgia (joint pain), and
headache.
Stage 2 occurs weeks to months after the initial infection as B. burgdorferi spreads from blood to other organs.
In this stage, the patient can be quite ill with malaise,
myalgia, and arthralgia, as well as neurological or cardiac
involvement. Common neurological manifestations include
Bell’s palsy (facial paralysis), inflammation of spinal nerve
roots, and chronic meningitis. The most common cardiac
manifestation is an irregular heart rhythm.
Stage 3 borreliosis occurs months to years later and can
involve the synovium, nervous system, and skin, though
skin involvement is more common in Europe than in
North America. Arthritis occurs in the majority of previously untreated patients; it is usually intermittent, involves
the large joints, particularly the knee, and lasts from weeks

■

to months in any given joint. Joint-fluid analysis typically
shows a WBC count of 10,000–30,000/μl. Late neurological involvement may include peripheral neuropathy and
encephalopathy, manifested as memory, mood, and sleep
disturbances.
Treatment with antibiotics is recommended for all stages
of Lyme disease but is most effective in the early stages.
Treatment for early Lyme disease (stage 1) is a course of
doxycycline for 14–28 days. Lyme arthritis is typically slow
to respond to antibiotic therapy. Despite antimicrobial
drug treatment, patients with persistent active arthritis and
persistently positive PCR tests may have incomplete microbial eradication and may be the most likely to benefit from
repeated treatment with injected antibiotics. However, the
disease in some people does not resolve at all; why is not
known.
Curiously, 25% of people infected with B. burgdorferi
never experience erythema migrans, and many infected
individuals are also unsure of tick bites. Hence, patients
with Lyme disease may present with arthritis as their first
complaint. Although this makes diagnosis extremely difficult, knowing that the patient lives in or recently traveled
to an endemic area can provide a critical clue.
A startling example of how sinister Lyme disease can
be is the case of Kris Kristofferson, a prolific singer, songwriter, and actor, now in his eighties. Kristofferson suffered
for years with severe memory loss presumed to be a manifestation of Alzheimer’s disease—until someone decided
to test him for Lyme disease. To his doctor’s surprise, and
relief, the singer tested positive. Kristofferson immediately
began antibiotic treatments and has since recovered much
of his memory.
Many other bacteria can cause septicemia and systemic illness (Table 26.5). Gram-negative organisms like
E. coli, Salmonella Typhi, and Francisella, and Gram-positive microbes like Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus, and
Bacillus anthracis, can grow in the bloodstream if they can
gain entrance. Even anaerobes that are normal inhabitants
of the intestine (for example, Bacteroides fragilis) can be
lethal if they escape the intestine and enter the blood, as
might happen following surgery. This is one reason surgical
patients are given massive doses of antibiotics immediately
before and after surgery.

Hepatitis Viruses Target the Liver

Hepatitis is a general term meaning “inflammation of
the liver.” Hepatitis is caused by several viruses, including
hepatitis A, B, C, and E viruses. Although these viruses
are members of very different families, they all target the
liver. We include them in this section on systemic infections because their infectious routes take them to the

bloodstream before delivering them to the liver. The disease symptoms of fever, vomiting, dark urine, clay-colored
stools, and often jaundice can be seen in all patients suffering from hepatitis, regardless of viral cause.
Hepatitis A virus (HAV) is a single-stranded RNA
picornavirus (Fig. 26.24A) that causes an acute infection spread person-to-person by the fecal-oral route, but
hepatitis A can also result from eating undercooked shellfish collected from contaminated waters. The virus replicates in the intestinal endothelium and is disseminated via
the bloodstream to the liver. After replicating in hepatocytes, the progeny enter the bile and are released into the

small intestine, explaining why stools are so infectious.
Though the virus has an early viremic stage after leaving
the intestine, it is rarely transmitted by transfusion, because
the viremic stage is transient, ending after liver symptoms
develop. In contrast, hepatitis B and C viruses produce persistent viremia and are readily transmitted by transfusion.
Many people who are infected with HAV are asymptomatic or exhibit very mild symptoms that include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, low-grade fever, and fatigue. As
the virus attacks the liver, patients may become jaundiced
(from the accumulation of bilirubin in the skin), and their
urine will turn dark brown. There is no specific treatment,

but the disease usually lasts for only a few months and
then resolves without establishing a carrier state. Disease
can be prevented, however, if immunoglobulin is given to
someone who has had contact with an infected individual.
A hepatitis A vaccine containing inactivated virus (called
HepA vaccine) is administered after 1 year of age. For those
not vaccinated, frequent hand washing is important for preventing the spread of the disease because it interrupts the
fecal-oral cycle.
In contrast to HAV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a partially double-stranded circular DNA virus (family Hepadnaviridae) that causes diseases of varying severity. These
include acute and chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocarcinoma. The virus also wears a membrane envelope
donned when progeny viruses are released from infected
cells. The virion coat protein, a surface antigen, is called
HBsAg. The virus makes an excess amount of HBsAg, so
it is sometimes extended as a tubular tail on one side of the
virus particle and is often found in the blood of infected
individuals in the form of noninfectious filamentous and
spherical particles (Fig. 26.24B). The presence of HBsAg
in blood is an indicator of HBV infection.
HBV is transferred primarily via blood transfusions,
contaminated needles shared by IV drug users, and any
human body fluid (saliva, semen, sweat, breast milk, tears,
urine, or feces). It can even be transferred transplacentally
to a fetus and can be sexually transmitted. Infection by
HBV has two stages: a short-term acute phase and a longterm chronic phase that, if it extends beyond 6 months,
may never resolve (chronic infection). Symptoms resemble
those of the flu, but with jaundice and brown urine. Liver
damage caused by HBV infection is due in large part to
an efficient cell-mediated immune response. Cytotoxic T
cells and natural killer cells cause immune lysis of infected
liver cells. Over the long term, chronic hepatitis will lead to

a scarred and hardened liver (cirrhosis), the only recourse
being a liver transplant. Fortunately, about 90% of those
infected are able to fight off infection and never proceed
to the chronic stage. A HepB vaccine (made from recombinant HBsAg) is available. Its administration is recommended after birth, followed by booster shots administered
by 2 months and 18 months of age.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) causes another form of hepatitis. HCV is a single-stranded positive-sense, linear RNA virus
with a lipid coat; it is a member of the Flaviviridae family. It
is transmitted by blood transfusions and causes 90% of transfusion-related cases of hepatitis. It can also be transmitted
by needle sticks, razor blades, tattooing, and, less frequently,
by sex. Over 100 million people worldwide are infected with
HCV. Screening for HCV (serology or PCR) is recommended
for anyone who exhibits signs of hepatitis or practices the risky
behaviors noted here. In addition, the CDC recommends
that anyone born between 1945 and 1965 (baby boomers) be
tested because, for unknown reasons, baby boomers are five
times more likely to be infected than other adults.
Most HCV-infected individuals (80%) do not exhibit
symptoms, and in those who do, symptoms may not appear
for 10–20 years. At least 75% of patients who exhibit symptoms ultimately progress to chronic hepatitis requiring
a liver transplant or possibly to liver cancer. Fortunately,
infection can be detected using ELISA. Liver biopsies of
HCV patients are used to determine the extent of liver
damage, which in turn helps establish the stage of disease.
Prevention of HBV or HCV infection for health care
personnel includes avoiding inadvertent needle sticks. If
such a stick should occur with HBV, anti-HBV immunoglobulin should be administered within 7 days. Currently
no effective post-exposure prophylaxis is recognized for
HCV. Chronic hepatitis can be treated with interferon, but
more effective treatment now includes antiviral protease
inhibitors that prevent the processing (by proteolysis) of an
important HCV polyprotein. Though vaccines have been
developed for HAV and HBV (see Section 24.6), no vaccine is yet available for HCV.

Note:

Since hepatitis viruses can be spread via contaminated
blood products, all blood donations collected by the Red Cross and
other agencies are tested for the presence of these viruses, as well
as for HIV. Thus, the blood supply is safe.

Ebola—The Perfect Pathogen or
Too Deadly for Its Own Good?

How would you define the perfect pathogen? Would it
be an organism that can kill its host with terrifying ease
and quickness? If so, Ebola virus would fit the description. Ebola virus, a lipid-enveloped, threadlike RNA virus

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

(Filoviridae) (see Fig. 25.4), was first associated with an
outbreak of 318 cases of a hemorrhagic disease in Zaire in
1976. Of the 318 people who contracted the disease, 280
died within days. The disease was characterized by acute
(rapid) onset of fever, severe muscle pains, horrible bleeding
from multiple orifices (nose, mouth, anus, and vagina), and
ultimately death. Also in 1976, 284 people in Sudan were
infected with the virus, and 156 of them died.
The Ebola virus has a frightening reputation. It spreads
like wildfire through the body after infection, causing
severe hemorrhagic fever, and typically kills 90% of its victims. Internal bleeding results in shock and acute respiratory distress, leading to death. The recent 2014–15
epidemic of Ebola in West Africa involved 28,683 cases,
40% of whom died (see Chapter 28).
The symptoms of Ebola (and of a related disease caused
by the Marburg virus) reflect subversion of the innate
immune system, coupled with uncontrolled viral replication, particularly in macrophages and dendritic cells. Ebola
virus infection of these cells enhances production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, and inhibits
stimulation of T-cell maturation by dendritic cells. Thus,
Ebola infections stimulate inflammatory processes leading to tissue damage, but they shut down early immune
responses and prevent activation of adaptive immune
responses, thereby allowing unfettered viral replication.
Ebola viral proteins and their locations in the virion are
shown in Figure 26.25A. Ebola VP35 protein is a component of the viral RNA polymerase complex, but it is also a
potent inhibitor of host interferon (IFN) production. The
cellular response to whichever IFN is made is inhibited by
VP24, which blocks the nuclear accumulation of a regulatory protein called STAT1. STAT1 is critical to IFN-stimulated gene expression. These and other strategies allow
rapid replication of the virus.
After replicating, Ebola offspring sprout from the cell surface in a mass of tangled threads (Fig. 26.25B). These new
virions go on to attack new cells, riddling blood vessels and
organs with damage as they go. Rapid release of new virions involves subverting another host mechanism, tetherin,
designed to slow viral spread. Paul Bates and his colleagues
at the University of Pennsylvania discovered that the cellular protein tetherin essentially tethers mature virus particles
inside a cell so that they are unable to spread. Tetherin is IFN
induced and can restrict the spread of structurally diverse
enveloped viruses, including HIV (thus, it is part of the
innate response). Ebola glycoprotein, however, counteracts
tetherin, so that nothing slows down viral spread. The result
is rapid release of massive numbers of virus particles that can
then quickly spread infection to other organs and tissues.
The outlook for a patient infected with Ebola is
dire. The incubation period is 4–16 days, and death
occurs within 7–16 days. With good supportive care,

activity. Administering blood plasma from people who have
recovered, anticoagulation agents to reduce hemorrhaging,
and interferon has had limited success.
Chemical inhibitors of the host cathepsin proteases,
which are required for viral replication, have been suggested as one possible antiviral therapy. Ebola enters a cell
when the virus membrane glycoprotein attaches to host
membranes. The virus is then taken up in an endosome.
Cathepsins in the endosome cleave the viral glycoprotein
and allow the virus membrane to fuse with the endosome
membrane, releasing the uncoated virus into the cytoplasm.
Cathepsin inhibitors prevent release and, thus, replication.
There is also some hope that an attenuated, replicationdeficient Ebola virus may serve as a vaccine.
Ebola epidemics result from person-to-person contact or
from inadvertent laboratory exposures. Fortunately, Ebola
outbreaks are self-contained because the viruses kill their victims quickly. Death comes before the virus can be transmitted
to a new host. Some scientists therefore argue that efficient
and quick killing is not the mark of a perfect pathogen. The
better pathogen lets its host linger to ensure a home for itself
and more opportunity to disseminate. So where does Ebola
go when it is not infecting humans? The natural ecology of
these viruses is largely unknown, although an association with
monkeys and/or bats as possible reservoirs is suggested.

Blood cultures are useful in diagnosing septicemia and
endocarditis.
Septicemia is caused by many Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacterial pathogens. It can start with the bite
of an infected insect, introduction via a wound, escape
from an abscess, or penetration of the mucosal epithelium by the pathogen (as through the intestine or
vagina); it can lead to disseminated, systemic disease.
Endocarditis can have acute or subacute onsets. Subacute bacterial endocarditis is usually an endogenous
infection of a heart valve caused by Streptococcus mutans.
Malaria, caused by Plasmodium species, manifests as
repeated episodes of chills, fever, and sweating, owing to
the organism’s ability to alter the antigenic appearance
of its surface proteins and evade the immune response.
Plague, caused by Yersinia pestis, has sylvatic and
urban infection cycles involving transmission between
fleas. The bite of an infected flea leads to bubonic plague.
Bubonic plague can progress to septicemic and pneumonic stages. Pneumonic plague can be spread directly
from person to person (no insect vector) by aerosolized
respiratory secretions.

Lyme disease is caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted from animal reservoirs to
humans by the bite of Ixodes ticks. The three stages
of Lyme disease are characterized by a bull’s-eye rash,
called erythema migrans (stage 1); joint, muscle, and
nerve pain (stage 2); and arthritis with WBCs in the
joint fluid (stage 3).
Hepatitis is caused by several unrelated viruses; among
them, HAV, HBV, and HCV account for most disease.
HAV is transmitted by the fecal-oral route, does not
establish chronic infection, and can be prevented by a
vaccine. HBV and HCV can be transmitted by blood
products (such as transfusions) and shared hypodermic
needles and can lead to chronic hepatitis. Vaccine for
HBV, but not HCV, is available.
Ebola virus spreads from human to human and kills its
victims quickly. Its viral proteins alter cytokine production and facilitate virus release from infected cells.

Central Nervous
System Infections

The brain and spinal cord are especially well protected against
infection. Microbes cannot gain easy access to the brain in
large measure because of the blood-brain barrier, a filter
mechanism that allows only selected substances into the brain.
The blood-brain barrier works to our advantage when harmful substances, such as bacteria, are prohibited from entering.
However, it works to our disadvantage when substances that
we want to enter the brain, such as antibiotics, are kept out.
The barrier is not a single structure but a function of the way
blood vessels, especially capillaries, are organized in the brain.
Furthermore, the endothelial cells in those vessels have tight
junctions that do not allow most compounds or microbes to
cross. And yet, brain infections do occur.

Case History: Meningitis

In April 2001, Laila, a 4-month-old infant from Saudi
Arabia, was hospitalized with fever, tender neck, and purplish spots (purpuric spots) on her trunk (Fig. 26.26A). Suspecting meningitis, the clinician took a cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) sample and examined it by Gram stain. The smear
revealed Gram-negative diplococci inside PMNs. The CSF
was turbid with 900 leukocytes per microliter, and Neisseria
meningitidis was confirmed by culture. The child was treated
with cefotaxime (a cephalosporin antibiotic; see Chapter 27)
and made a full recovery. Her father, Abdul, the person who
brought her in, was clinically well. However, the meningococcus was isolated from his oropharynx, as well as from the
throat of the patient’s 2-year-old brother. Isolates from the

patient, her father, and her brother were positive by agglutination with meningococcal A/C/Y/W135 polyvalent reagent.
Records showed that the father previously received a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine. All three isolates were confirmed to be meningococcus serogroup W135. DNA analysis
found the three isolates to be indistinguishable, meaning that
the father and his children were infected with the same strain
of N. meningitidis. Why did Laila’s brother not have meningitis? And why was Laila’s vaccinated father colonized?
Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis can be either bacterial or viral in origin. Sinus and ear
infections can extend directly to the meninges, whereas
septicemic spread requires passage through the blood-brain
barrier. Viral meningitis is serious but rarely fatal in people with a normal immune system. The symptoms generally
persist for 7–10 days and then completely resolve. Bacterial
meningitis is usually caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae,
Neisseria meningitidis, or Haemophilus influenzae. Symptoms of bacterial meningitis can include sudden onset of
fever, headache, neck pain or stiffness, painful sensitivity
to strong light (photophobia), vomiting (often without
abdominal complaints), and irritability. Prompt medical
attention is extremely important because the disease can
quickly progress to convulsions and death.
The meningococcus N. meningitidis (Fig. 26.26B) can
colonize the human oropharynx, where it causes mild, if
any, disease. At any given time, 10%–20% of the healthy
population can be colonized and asymptomatic. The
organism spreads directly by person-to-person contact or
indirectly via droplet nuclei from sneezing or fomites. The
problem arises when this organism enters the bloodstream.
Unlike N. gonorrhoeae, the cause of gonorrhea, N. meningitidis is very resistant to complement, owing to its production of a polysaccharide capsule. The capsule allows the
microbe to produce a transient blood infection (bacteremia) and reach the blood-brain barrier.
How does N. meningitidis enter the bloodstream from
the nasopharynx and then cross the blood-brain barrier?

The organism initially uses type IV pili to adhere to and
enter nasopharyngeal endothelial cells (type IV pili are
discussed in Section 25.3). The bacteria then cross the
endothelial cell layer by transcytosis, a process by which
an internalized pathogen passes through a host cell along
microtubules to the opposite side. Ultimately, the pathogen passes into the capillary lumen and is swept away to
the brain. Once in the brain, type IV pili again adhere to
endothelial cells, but this time they trigger the recruitment
of host proteins that destabilize intercellular junctions.
The bacteria then slip between the loosened junctions and
enter the cerebrospinal fluid. Once in the CSF, microbes
can multiply almost at will. Figure 26.26C and D show
the remarkable damage (greening) that N. meningitidis and
other microbes, such as S. pneumoniae, cause in the brain.
Several antigenic types of capsules, called type-specific
capsules, are produced by different strains of pathogenic N.
meningitidis: types A, B, C, W135, and Y. Types A, C, Y,
and W135 are usually associated with epidemic infections
seen among people kept in close proximity, such as college students or military personnel. Type B meningococcus is typically involved in sporadic infections. However,
large outbreaks of type B in the United States occurred
at Princeton University and UC Santa Barbara in 2013.
Antibodies to these capsular antigens are used to classify
the capsular types of the organisms causing an outbreak.
Knowing the capsular type of organism involved in each
case helps determine whether the disease cases are related
and where the infection may have started. In Abdul’s case,
a polyvalent reagent containing antibodies to the four main
capsular types was used to confirm N. meningitidis.
Meningococcal meningitis is highly communicable. As a
result, close contacts, such as the parents or siblings of any
patient with meningococcal disease, should receive antimicrobial prophylaxis within 24 hours of diagnosis; a single
dose of ciprofloxacin (a quinolone antibiotic, discussed in
Section 27.4) can be given to adults, and 2 days of rifampicin given to children. Highly susceptible populations can
be immunized with a vaccine containing four of the five
capsular structures (type B capsule is not immunogenic; see

Case History: Botulism—
It Is What You Eat

In June, a 47-year-old resident of Oklahoma was admitted to
the hospital with rapid onset of progressive dizziness, blurred
vision, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, and nausea. Findings on examination included drooping eyelids, facial paralysis,
and impaired gag reflex. He developed breathing difficulties
and required mechanical ventilation. The patient reported
that during the 24 hours before onset of symptoms, he had eaten
home-canned green beans and a stew containing roast beef
and potatoes. Analysis of the patient’s stool detected botulinum
type A toxin, but no Clostridium botulinum organisms were
found. The patient was hospitalized for 49 days, including
42 days on mechanical ventilation, before being discharged.

Imagine a disease that causes complete loss of muscle function. Using secreted exotoxins (neurotoxins), two microbes
cause lethal paralytic diseases. In one instance, the victim suffers a flaccid paralysis in which the muscles go limp, as in the
case history just given, causing paralysis and respiratory difficulty. Voluntary muscles fail to respond to the mind’s will
because botulinum toxin interferes with neural transmission.
The disease (called botulism) is typically food-borne and is
caused by an anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore-forming bacillus named Clostridium botulinum (see Chapter 18).
In striking contrast to botulism is tetanus, a very painful
disease in which muscles continually and involuntarily contract (called tetany or spastic paralysis). Tetanus is caused
by tetanospasmin, a potent exotoxin made by another
anaerobic, Gram-positive spore-forming bacillus, called
Clostridium tetani (Fig. 26.27A). Tetanospasmin interferes with neural transmission, but in contrast to botulism
toxin, it causes excessive nerve signaling to muscles, forcing the victim’s back to arch grotesquely while the arms
flex and legs extend. The patient remains locked this way
until death. Spasms can be strong enough to fracture the
patient’s vertebrae. Figure 26.27B shows the result of
injecting a mouse’s hind leg with just a tiny amount of tetanus toxin. In both botulism and tetanus, death can result
from asphyxiation.
Botulism is typically caused by ingesting preformed
toxin, although infected wounds or germination of

environment must be present. Home-canning processes
are designed to remove oxygen in the canned food, as
well as sterilize the food, but if the sterilization process is
incomplete, then surviving spores germinate and produce
toxin. The toxin is susceptible to heat but will remain
active in improperly cooked food. After ingestion, the
toxin is absorbed from the intestine. As in the case history given here, the organism is often absent from stool
samples. This is why serological identification of the toxin
is important.
A rare form of botulism, called infant botulism or
“floppy head syndrome,” can occur when infants (not older
children) are fed honey. Honey can harbor C. botulinum
spores that can germinate in the gastrointestinal tract, after

trates normal neurotransmission at a neuromuscular junction, the target of botulism toxin. A signal sent from a
motor neuron to the neuromuscular junction causes the
release of the neurotransmitter molecule acetylcholine
from vesicles in the axon terminal. Once released, acetylcholine traverses the synapse and causes muscle contraction. Figure 26.28B shows the proteins within the vesicle
and plasma membranes that allow the synaptic vesicle to
fuse with the plasma membrane.

CHAPTER 26

Once botulism toxin enters a peripheral nerve by endocytosis (Fig. 26.28C), the low pH that forms in the
endosome reduces the disulfide bonds holding the two
halves of the toxin together. The heavy chain assembles
as a channel in the membrane through which the proteolytic light chain moves into the cytoplasm. The light
chain then cleaves key host proteins, such as synaptobrevin (a vesicle-associated membrane protein, or VAMP),
syntaxin, or synaptosomal-associated protein (SNAP-25)
involved in the exocytosis of vesicles containing acetylcholine (Fig. 26.28D). Without acetylcholine to activate nerve transmission, muscles will not contract and the
patient is paralyzed.
Although botulism disease is now rare, the toxin is
considered a select biological agent of potential use to
bioterrorists. As such, its use in laboratories is under
strict governmental control. But botulism toxin also has
important medical uses. Because the toxin can safely
relax muscles in a localized area if injected in small doses,
botulism toxin, or Botox, is used cosmetically by plastic surgeons to reduce facial wrinkles in some patients,
and therapeutically by neurologists to treat migraine
headaches.

Mechanism of tetanus neurotoxin. Earlier we mentioned

that botulism and tetanus toxins are nearly identical
in structure and mechanism. With such a high degree
of mechanistic similarity, why do tetanus and botulism toxins have such drastically different effects? The
answer is based on where each toxin acts in the nervous
system.
Tetanus, in contrast to botulism, is not a food-borne
disease. Clostridium tetani spores are introduced into the
body by trauma (such as by stepping on the wrong end of a
nail). Necrotic tissue then provides the anaerobic environment required for germination. Growing, vegetative cells
release tetanospasmin, which enters the peripheral nerve
cells at the site of injury. But rather than cleaving targets
here, the toxin travels up axons in the direction opposite to
nerve signal transmission until it reaches the spinal column,
where it becomes fixed at the presynaptic inhibitory motor
neuron. There the toxin also cleaves proteins like VAMP,
but the function of vesicles in these nerves is to release
inhibitory neurotransmitters that dampen nerve impulses.
Tetanus toxin blocks release of the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and glycine into the synaptic cleft, leaving nerve impulses unchecked. As a result, impulses come
too frequently and produce the generalized muscle spasms
characteristic of tetanus. Figure 26.29
illustrates the
mechanism of tetanus toxin action. A tetanus toxoid vaccine is available and is administered to children as part of
the DTaP (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis) vaccine (see Section 24.6).

Thought Questions

26.11 Figure 26.29 demonstrates that tetanus toxin has a
mode of action (spastic paralysis) opposite to that of botulism
toxin (flaccid paralysis). Since they have opposing modes of action, can botulism toxin be used to save a patient with tetanus?
26.12 How do the actions of tetanus toxin and botulinum
toxin actually help the bacteria colonize or obtain nutrients?
26.13 If Clostridium botulinum is an anaerobe, how might

Case History: Eastern Equine Encephalitis
In August, Mr. C brought his 21-year-old son, Rich, to a New
Jersey emergency department. Rich appeared dazed and had
trouble responding to simple commands. When questioned
about his son’s activities over the previous few months, Mr. C
told the physician that Rich spent the month of July relaxing
and sunning himself on New Jersey beaches and visiting a
pond in a wooded area near a horse farm. On the afternoon
prior to admission, Rich had become lethargic and tired. He
returned home and went to bed. That evening, his father woke
him for supper, but Rich was confused and had no appetite.
By 11 p.m., Rich had a fever of 40.7°C (103.5°F) and could
not respond to questions. A few hours later, when his father
had trouble rousing him, he brought Rich to the ED. Over the
next week, Rich’s condition worsened to the point where his
limbs were paralyzed. Two weeks later he died. Serum samples taken upon entering the hospital and a few days before he
died showed a sixfold rise in antibody titer to eastern equine
encephalitis (EEE) virus. Brain autopsy showed many small
foci of necrosis in both the gray and white matter.
The EEE virus, a member of the family Togaviridae, is transmitted from bird to bird by mosquitoes. Horses contract
the disease in the same way. Rich contracted it inadvertently
while visiting the pond. The disease, an encephalitis, is often
fatal (35% mortality) but fortunately rare. One reason human
disease is rare is that the species of mosquito that usually
transmits the virus between marsh birds does not prey on
humans. But sometimes a human-specific mosquito bites
an infected bird and then transmits EEE virus to humans.
Another reason human disease is rare is that the virus generally does not fare well in the body. Many persons infected
with EEE virus have no apparent illness, because the immune
system thwarts viral replication. However, as already noted,
mortality is high in individuals that do develop disease.
An interesting point in the case history is that diagnosis relied on detecting an increase in antibody titer to
the virus. Typically, at the point that disease symptoms
first appear, the body has not had time to generate large
amounts of specific antibodies. After a week or so, often

when the patient is nearing recovery (convalescence), antibody titers have risen manyfold. The rule of thumb is that
a greater-than-fourfold rise in antibody titer between acute
disease and convalescence (or in this case death) indicates
that the patient has had the disease. While this knowledge
could not help the patient in the case described here, it was
valuable in terms of public health and prevention strategies.
Several bacterial, fungal, and viral causes of encephalitis
and meningitis are listed in Table 26.6.

Prions Are Infectious Proteins

Imagine slowly losing your mind and knowing there is nothing you can do about it. An unusual infectious agent called
the prion has been implicated as the cause of a series of relatively rare but invariably fatal brain diseases (Table 26.7).
Prions are infectious agents that do not have a nucleic acid
genome. The protein alone can mediate an infection. The
prion is now recognized as an infectious, misfolded protein
that resists inactivation by procedures that destroy proteins.
The discovery that proteins alone can transmit an infectious
disease came as a surprise to the scientific community. Diseases caused by prions are especially worrying, since prions
resist destruction by many chemical agents and remain active
after heating at extremely high temperatures. There have
even been documented cases in which sterilized neurosurgical instruments, originally used on a prion-infected person,
still held infectious agent and transmitted the disease to a
subsequent surgery patient. Extremely rigorous decontamination procedures, such as autoclaving surgical instruments
immersed in 1-M sodium hydroxide, will destroy prions.
How can a nonliving entity without nucleic acid be an
infectious agent? Prions associated with human brain disease are thought to be aberrantly folded forms of a normal
brain protein (PrPC). The theory is that when a prion, designated PrPSc, is introduced into the body and manages to
enter the brain, it will cause normally folded forms of the
protein to refold incorrectly (Fig. 26.30A). The improperly folded proteins fit together like Lego blocks to produce
damaging aggregated structures within brain cells.

Prion diseases are often called spongiform encephalopathies because the postmortem appearance of the brain
includes large, spongy vacuoles in the cortex and cerebellum. These are visible in a brain sample from a victim of one
of these diseases, called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD)
(Fig. 26.30B and C). Most mammalian species appear to
develop these diseases.
Since 1996, mounting evidence has pointed to a causal
relationship between outbreaks in Europe of a disease in cattle called bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or “mad
cow disease”) caused by prions and a disease in humans
called variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Both disorders are invariably fatal. For humans to contract disease, prions from contaminated meat are ingested and penetrate the
intestinal mucosa via the antigen-sampling M cells in Peyer’s
patches. The circulation then traffics the agent to the brain.
As of this writing, only four cases of BSE in cattle have
been detected in the United States since 1993. Because
of aggressive surveillance efforts in the United States and
Canada (where 20 cases have been found), it is unlikely,
but not impossible, that BSE will be a food-borne hazard
to humans in this country. The CDC monitors the trends
and current incidence of typical CJD (approximately 300
cases per year) and variant CJD (3 cases total) in the United
States (see eTopic 26.7). The worldwide incidence of CJD is
one per 1 million population.
There is no cure for CJD or vCJD. A test to detect
PrPSc in asymptomatic primates has been developed but
is not yet ready for human screening. The test is called
protein-mediated cyclic amplification (PMCA). PMCA has
successfully identified the presence of very tiny amounts of
PrPSc in blood or urine. The process involves adding large
amounts of normal PrP (PrPC) to samples containing tiny
amounts of PrPSc prions. The prions, if present in the sample, will seed the misfolding of PrPC to PrPSc molecules
that aggregate. Sonication is then used to partially break
up the newly formed PrPSc aggregates into pieces that can
further seed the misfolding and aggregation of normal PrP.
Repeated cycles of sonication-incubation will exponentially

amplify the amount of PrPSc present in a sample. The PrPSc
is then identified by western blot (see Section 12.2).

Concluding Thoughts
In this chapter we have described key concepts of infectious
disease using just a small sample of disease-causing pathogens. Other diseases are considered elsewhere in the book
or on the accompanying website. These include anthrax,
cholera, the common cold (caused by rhinovirus), dengue
fever, diphtheria, gastric ulcers (Helicobacter pylori), herpes,
AIDS, warts (human papillomavirus), influenza, salmonellosis, Streptococcus agalactiae infections, West Nile disease,
and Whipple’s disease (Tropheryma whipplei). The principal
goal in this and the previous chapter was to illustrate how
microbial metabolism can undermine the physiology of a
human host. The next chapter will describe how humans
fight back using pharmacology to sabotage the physiology
of the infecting microbes.

27.1 Fundamentals of Antimicrobial Therapy

ntibiotics have played a major role in increasing life expectancy throughout the world. But
antibiotics may soon become useless. Indiscriminant use of antibiotics to treat patients and boost
animal growth has led to widespread antibiotic resistance in many pathogens. As a result, we are becoming vulnerable to infectious diseases once thought
conquered. In Chapter 27 we discuss how antimicrobial agents work, how clinicians determine which
antibiotics should be used, how microbes resist antibiotics, and how new antibiotics are being discovered.

Antarctic antibiotic. Lindsey Shaw at the University of South
Florida (USF) has been searching for novel antimicrobials that
can kill antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. A recent find
is a diterpene chemical called darwinolide, which was extracted from the Antarctic sponge Dendrilla membranosa by USF
colleague Bill Baker. Shaw’s students showed that darwinolide has the novel ability to kill biofilms of methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) fourfold better than it can kill
planktonically growing MRSA. The scientists predict that the
darwinolide structure could provide a unique scaffold upon
which more potent anti-MRSA therapeutics can be built.

Why look for novel antibiotics in
Antarctica?

Nature provided many antibiotics
currently used in the clinic. Products
from nature have excellent therapeutic properties and still represent viable sources of chemistry. Cures for
many human diseases likely exist in
nature, if only we can find them. But
the potential of most easy-to-explore environments, like
soil, has already been exhausted. We must now travel to
exotic, hard-to-reach environments looking for new compounds. Antarctica is a perfect example. It possesses a rich
biology we can explore for the next blockbuster antibiotic.
Darwinolide preferentially targets established MRSA
biofilms. How?
We don’t know, although we are working on it! Biofilms are
resistant to antibiotics for many reasons (chemical microenvironments, stress responses, persister cells, and so on).
Clearly, something about darwinolide is different from most
drugs. Perhaps it targets something in biofilm persister
cells missing in planktonic cells. It may be that darwinolide
has a novel chemical structure that facilitates penetration
of the biofilm. Or maybe biofilm bacteria undergoing stress
response–type behavior engage a darwinolide-sensitive
pathway, or target, that is lacking in active, free-growing cells.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Antibiotics undeniably have been a benefit to modern
society. We live longer than in the past in large measure
because of antibiotics. Infections we consider minor today
often killed their victims just 50 or 60 years ago. But there
has been a downside too: the development of genetically
adapted, antibiotic-resistant pathogens that threaten to
make current antibiotics obsolete. The Current Research
Highlight illustrates the enormous efforts taking place in
laboratories and at extreme locales throughout the world to
discover replacement antibiotics.
How serious is the antibiotic resistance problem? Consider the case of a 56-year-old man with diabetes who
entered the hospital for a heart transplant. The operation went well, but 1 week after the surgery, he developed a severe chest wound infection notable for exuded
pus. Treatment with oxacillin, a penicillin derivative commonly used to combat infections, failed, and the patient
became comatose. The diagnostic microbiology laboratory
ultimately identified the agent as a methicillin (oxacillin)resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), prompting the
surgeon to immediately place the patient on intravenous
vancomycin for 6 weeks. Vancomycin is an antibiotic, structurally different from methicillin and oxacillin, that can
usually kill methicillin-resistant bacteria. Fortunately, this
patient recovered; too often, they do not.
Where did the infection come from? Surprising as it
may seem, this drug-resistant pathogen was a resident of
the hospital itself. Nasal swabs taken of all hospital personnel revealed that several members of the surgical team harbored S. aureus as part of their resident microbiota. But
which individual was the actual source of the patient’s
infection? In what could be described as “forensic microbiology,” each strain was subjected to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and the resulting genomic restriction patterns
were compared with that of the isolate from the infected
patient. A match pointed to the source. The unwitting culprit turned out to be the perfusionist who manipulated the
tubing used for cardiopulmonary bypass.
Hospital-acquired, or nosocomial, infections are not
unusual. As many as 5%–10% of all patients admitted
to acute-care hospitals acquire nosocomial infections,
resulting in over 80,000 deaths each year. The deaths
are due, in part, to the poor health of the patient and
in part to the antibiotic-resistant nature of bacteria lurking in hospitals. In fact, as many as 60%–70% of staph
infections that develop in a hospital setting are the result
of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). A foreboding
report from the United Kingdom finds that one in four
nursing-home residents is colonized by MRSA. A recent
study in the United States found that the noses of nearly
one in five nonhospitalized people are also colonized by
MRSA. Antibiotic resistance is a problem that will only
get worse.

We begin Chapter 27 with a discussion of the golden
age of antibiotic discovery (1940–60) and move on to
describe the basic concepts of antibiotics and their use
and misuse. We will delve into the ways genomic and proteomic approaches broaden our ability to search for new
antibiotics and targets—all part of our attempt to stay one
step ahead of evolving, antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The
urgency of this task cannot be overstated. In May 2016, an
E. coli uropathogen resistant to a drug of last resort, colistin, arrived in the United States.

27.1

Fundamentals of
Antimicrobial Therapy

Antibiotics (from the Greek meaning “against life”) are
compounds produced by one species of microbe that can
kill or inhibit the growth of other microbes. However, the
term “antibiotics” is also used for synthetic chemotherapeutic agents, such as sulfonamides, that are clinically useful but chemically synthesized.
We think of antibiotics as being a recent biotechnological
development, but they have actually been used for centuries. Ancient remedies called for cloths soaked with organic
material to be placed on wounds to allow them to heal faster.
This organic material likely contained “natural antibiotics”
that killed bacteria and prevented further infection. The
medicinal properties of molds were also recognized for centuries. The ancient Chinese successfully treated boils with
warm soil and molds scraped from cheeses, and in England
a paste of moldy bread was a home remedy for wound infections up until the beginning of the twentieth century.

The Golden Age of Antibiotic Discovery

The modern antibiotic revolution began with the
discovery of penicillin in 1928 by Sir Alexander Fleming
(1881–1955). This discovery was actually a rediscovery, and
was arguably one of the greatest examples of serendipity
in science. Although Fleming generally receives the credit
for discovering penicillin, a French medical student, Ernest
Duchesne (1874–1912), originally discovered the antibiotic
properties of Penicillium in 1896.
Duchesne observed that Arab stable boys at the nearby
army hospital kept their saddles in a dark and damp room
to encourage mold to grow on them. When asked why, they
told him the mold helped heal saddle sores on the horses.
Intrigued, Duchesne prepared a solution from the mold
and injected it into diseased guinea pigs. All recovered.
Penicillium was forgotten in the scientific community
until Fleming rediscovered it one day in the late 1920s.
Petri dishes were glass in those days and could be rewashed

and sterilized. Fleming was preparing to wash a pile of old
petri dishes he had used to grow the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. He opened and examined each dish before tossing it into a cleaning solution. He noticed that one dish had
grown contaminating mold, which in and of itself was not
unusual in old plates, but all around the mold the staph
bacteria had failed to grow (Fig. 27.1A).
Fleming took a sample of the mold and found that it
was from the penicillium family, later identified as Penicillium notatum. The mold appeared to have synthesized
a chemical, now known as penicillin (Fig. 27.1B), which
diffused through the agar, killing cells of S. aureus
before they could form colonies. Fleming (Fig. 27.1C)
presented his findings in 1929, but they raised little
interest, since penicillin appeared to be unstable and
would not remain active in the body long enough to kill
pathogens.
As World War II began, Oxford professor Howard
Florey (Fig. 27.1D) and his colleague Ernst Chain, rediscovered Fleming’s work, thought it held promise, and
set about purifying penicillin. To their amazement, the

purified penicillin cured the mice infected with staphylococci or streptococci. Subsequent human trials proved successful (Fig. 27.1E), and penicillin gained wide use, saving
countless lives during the war. Fleming, Florey, and Chain
received the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine
for their work.
The next landmark discovery in antibiotics was made
by Gerhard Domagk (1895–1964), a German physician at
the Bayer Institute of Experimental Pathology and Bacteriology, who investigated antimicrobial compounds in the
1930s (Fig. 27.2A). In 1935, Domagk’s 6-year-old child
developed a serious streptococcal infection induced by an
innocent pinprick to the finger. The infection spread to her
axillary (armpit) lymph nodes and became so severe that
lancing and draining the pus 14 times did little to help.
The only remaining alternative was to amputate the arm.
Unfortunately, even this option would probably not save
her life.
Frustrated, Domagk took what would appear to be drastic measures. He administered a dose of a red dye (Prontosil) he was investigating. On agar plates (the usual medium

for testing antibiotics), Prontosil had shown absolutely no
ability to inhibit the growth of streptococcus. Domagk,
however, had tested the drug in animals, not agar plates,
where he found it could cure animals of infection. Remarkably, Domagk’s daughter recovered completely.
Domagk discovered that Prontosil was metabolized by
the body into another compound, sulfanilamide, clearly
lethal to the streptococcus. This finding led to an entire
class of drugs, the sulfa drugs, that saved hundreds of
thousands of lives. The take-home message of this story is
that an antibiotic’s activity on a plate, or lack thereof, does
not necessarily correlate with the drug’s activity in a patient.

Sulfanilamide is an analog of para-aminobenzoic acid
(PABA), a precursor of folic acid, a vitamin necessary for
nucleic acid synthesis (Fig. 27.2B). Sulfanilamide and
other sulfa drugs bind to and inhibit the enzyme that converts PABA to folic acid. Without folic acid to make nucleic
acid precursors, the pathogen stops growing. Sulfa drugs
inhibit bacterial growth without affecting human cells
because folic acid is not synthesized by humans (it is a
dietary supplement instead), and because bacteria do not
transport folic acid (they must make it themselves).
In a dark turn, Domagk’s possible participation in
human experimentation with concentration camp prisoners during World War II (ordered by his German employer)
was a source of controversy that haunted him long after the
war ended. Yet his contributions to medicine continued; he
also developed the first effective chemotherapy for tuberculosis, the thiosemicarbazones and isoniazid, which are still
used today.
During the same period of history, Selman Waksman
(1888–1973) at Rutgers University began screening 10,000
strains of soil bacteria and fungi for their ability to inhibit
growth or kill bacteria (Fig. 27.2C). In 1944, this herculean effort paid off with the discovery of streptomycin, an
antibiotic produced by the actinomycete Streptomyces griseus (Fig. 27.2D). Waksman’s discovery of streptomycin
triggered the antibiotic gold rush that is still under way and
earned him the 1952 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.

Antibiotics Exhibit Selective Toxicity

As early as 1904, the German physician Paul Ehrlich
(1854–1915) realized that a successful antimicrobial compound would be a “magic bullet” that selectively kills or
inhibits the pathogen but not the host. This seemingly
obvious premise was innovative at the time. Ehrlich made
several discoveries based on this concept, the most celebrated of which was the arsenical compound known as Salvarsan. Salvarsan proved to be quite effective in killing the
syphilis agent Treponema pallidum (this was long before
penicillin was discovered). Syphilis, a sexually transmitted
disease, had been untreatable and the source of considerable long-term suffering. Ehrlich’s “magic bullet” concept
is now known as selective toxicity. Although Ehrlich’s
selective toxicity concept was right, Salvarsan itself was
not as selectively toxic as he thought. This arsenical compound harmed the host, but fortunately usually killed off
the treponemes before killing the patient.
Selective toxicity is possible because key aspects of a
microbe’s physiology are different from those of eukaryotes. For example, suitable bacterial antibiotic targets
include peptidoglycan, which eukaryotic cells lack, and
ribosomes, which are structurally distinct between Bacteria and Eukarya. Thus, chemicals like penicillin, which

CHAPTER 27

prevents peptidoglycan synthesis, and tetracycline, which
binds to bacterial 30S ribosomal subunits, inhibit bacterial
growth but are essentially invisible to host cells, since they
do not interact with them at low doses.
Although their intended targets are bacterial cells, some
antibiotics, particularly at high doses, can interact with elements of eukaryotic cells and cause side effects that harm
the patient. For example, chloramphenicol, a drug that targets bacterial 50S ribosomal subunits, can interfere with
the development of blood cells in bone marrow—a phenomenon that may result in aplastic anemia (failure to
produce red blood cells). The toxicity of an antibiotic can
also depend on the age of the patient. Ciprofloxacin, for
instance, can cause defects in human bone growth plates
and should not be administered to children. Problems can
even arise if the drug does not directly impact mammalian
physiology. For example, many people develop an extreme
allergic sensitivity to penicillin, in which case the treatment
of an infection may end up being worse than the infection
itself. Physicians must be aware of these allergies and use
alternative antibiotics to avoid harming their patients.
As a student of microbiology, you must be able to
properly distinguish between the terms “drug susceptibility” and “drug sensitivity.” A microbe is susceptible to
the drug’s action, but a human can develop an allergic
sensitivity to the drug.

Spectrum of Activity

No single antimicrobial drug affects all microbes. As a
result, antimicrobial drugs are classified by the types of
organisms they affect. Thus, we have antifungal, antibacterial, antiprotozoan, and antiviral agents. The term “antibiotic” is usually reserved for compounds that affect bacteria.
Even within a group, one agent might have a very narrow
spectrum of activity, meaning it affects only a few species, while another antibiotic inhibits many species. For
instance, penicillin has a relatively narrow spectrum of
activity, killing primarily Gram-positive bacteria. However,
ampicillin is penicillin with an added amino group that
allows the drug to more easily penetrate the Gram-negative
outer membrane. As a result of this chemically engineered
modification, ampicillin kills Gram-positive and Gramnegative organisms, giving it a broader spectrum of activity than penicillin has. There are antimicrobials as well that
exhibit extremely narrow activities. One example is isoniazid, which is clinically useful only against Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, the agent of tuberculosis. The spectrum of
activity of select antibiotics is explored in eTopic 27.1.
Patients typically believe that all antibiotics kill their
intended targets. This is a misconception. Many drugs
simply prevent growth of the organism and let the body’s
immune system dispatch the intruding microbe. Thus,

■

ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY

■

1095

antimicrobials are also classified on the basis of whether or
not they kill the microbe. An antibiotic is bactericidal if
it kills the target microbe, whereas it is bacteriostatic if it
merely prevents bacterial growth.
Antibiotics are good for treating infectious diseases, but
do our microbiomes pay the price? As discussed in several
prior chapters, we are increasingly aware that our natural
microbiota contribute in important ways to human health
and development. Many studies are now exploring the
impact of antibiotic use on host-microbiota interactions (discussed in Chapters 23 and 24). We have known for decades
that antibiotics—especially broad-spectrum antibiotics—
can destroy the ecological balance of bacterial species in the
gut (as well as at other body sites) and lead to gastrointestinal disease. Pathology can result when one species resistant to the antibiotic gains a growth advantage over various
drug-susceptible species that ordinarily keep the pathogen in check (see the discussion of Clostridioides difficile,
formerly Clostridium difficile, in Section 26.4). But what
other effects might there be when the microbial balance of
power in the intestine is disturbed? We may ultimately find
that directing the toxicity of an antibiotic to a single bacterial species (while leaving all others alone) has benefits to
human health that we do not currently understand.

Measuring Drug Susceptibility

One critical decision a clinician must make when treating
an infection is which antibiotic to prescribe for the patient.
There are several factors to consider, including:
■

The relative effectiveness of different antibiotics on
the organism causing the infection. This determination will reveal whether the organism developed resistance to a drug.

■

The average attainable tissue levels of each drug. An
antibiotic may work on an agar plate, but the concentration at which it affects bacterial growth may be too high
to be safe in the patient. In fact, an important aspect
of designing new antibiotics is to enhance the pharmacological activity of an existing drug—for example,
modifying it so that the body does not break it down or
quickly excrete it in urine.

Minimal inhibitory concentration. The in vitro effective-

ness of an antimicrobial agent is determined by measuring how little of it is needed to stop growth. This amount
is classically measured in terms of an antibiotic’s minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC), defi ned as the lowest concentration of the drug that will prevent the growth
of an organism. But the MIC for any one drug will differ
among different bacterial species. For example, the MIC
of ampicillin needed to stop the growth of Staphylococcus

aureus will be different from that needed to inhibit Shigella
dysenteriae. The reasons that a drug may be more effective
against one organism than another include the ease with
which the drug penetrates the cell and the affi nity of the
drug for its molecular target.
So how do we measure MIC? As shown in Figure 27.3,
an antibiotic is serially diluted along a row of test tubes containing nutrient broth. After dilution, the organism to be
tested is inoculated at low, constant density into each tube,
and the tubes are usually incubated overnight. Growth of
the organism is seen as turbidity. In Figure 27.3, the tubes
with the highest concentration of drug are clear, indicating
no growth. The tube containing the MIC is the tube with
the lowest concentration of drug that shows no growth.
Note, however, that the MIC does not indicate whether a
drug is bacteriostatic or bactericidal.
Thought Questions

27.1 Figure 27.3 illustrates how MICs are determined. Test

your understanding of how MICs are measured in the following example. The drug tobramycin is added to a concentration
of 1,000 μg/ml in a tube of broth from which serial twofold
dilutions are made. Including the initial tube (tube 1), there are
a total of ten tubes. Twenty-four hours after all the tubes are
inoculated with Listeria monocytogenes, turbidity is observed
in tubes 6–10. What is the MIC?

27.2 What additional test performed on an MIC series of tubes
will tell you whether a drug is bacteriostatic or bactericidal?

concentration (in μg/ml) when placed on an agar plate. The MIC corresponds to the point where bacterial growth crosses the numbered
strip.
■

MIC determinations are very useful for estimating a
single drug’s effectiveness against a single bacterial pathogen isolated from a patient, but they are not very practical
when trying to screen 20 or more different drugs. Dilutions take time—time that the technician, not to mention
the patient, may not have. The time required to evaluate
antibiotic effectiveness can be reduced by using a strip test
(like the Etest shown in Fig. 27.4) that avoids the need
for dilutions. The strip, containing a gradient of antibiotic, is placed on an agar plate freshly seeded with a dilute
lawn of bacteria. While the bacteria are trying to grow,
the drug diffuses out of the strip and into the media.
Drug emanating from the more concentrated areas of the
strip will travel faster and farther through the agar than
will drug from the less concentrated areas of the strip.
Thus, the drug’s effect (killing or inhibiting the growth
of cells) will extend farther away from the strip at locations of high concentration than at locations of lower concentration. The result is a zone of inhibition where the
antibiotic has stopped bacterial growth. The MIC is the
point at which the elliptical zone of inhibition intersects
with the strip.
Kirby-Bauer Disk Susceptibility Test. Although the strip

test eliminates the time and effort needed to make dilutions, it would take 20 or more plates to test an equal number of antibiotics for just one bacterial isolate. Clinical
labs can receive up to 100 or more isolates in one day, so

individual MIC determinations are impractical. A simplified agar diffusion test, however, which can test 12 antibiotics on one plate, makes evaluating antibiotic susceptibility
a manageable task.
Named for its inventors, the Kirby-Bauer assay uses
a series of round filter paper disks impregnated with different antibiotics. A dispenser (Fig. 27.5A) delivers up to
12 disks simultaneously to the surface of an agar plate covered by a bacterial lawn. Each disk is marked to indicate the
drug used. During incubation, the drugs diffuse away from
the disks into the surrounding agar and inhibit growth of
the lawn to different distances (Fig. 27.5B–D). The zones
of inhibition vary in width, depending on the antibiotic
used, the concentration of drug in the disk, and the susceptibility of the organism to the drug. The diameter of
the zone correlates to the MIC of the antibiotic against the
organism tested. Figure 27.5B and C show the results for
methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA and MRSA, respectively). Note the lack
of inhibition by the oxacillin disk (arrow in Fig. 27.5C).
This strain is resistant to both methicillin and oxacillin
because they are structurally similar.
Correlations between MIC values and Kirby-Bauer
zone sizes are made empirically. Every disk containing a

given antibiotic is impregnated with a standard concentration of drug, and every antibiotic has a quantifiable MIC
that will differ when tested against different bacterial species and strains. The outermost ring of the no-growth
zone in a Kirby-Bauer disk test must, by definition, contain the minimal concentration of drug needed to prevent
growth on agar. Thus, if species A and B have MIC values for penicillin of 4 μg/ml and 40 μg/ml, respectively,
then species A will exhibit a proportionally larger zone of
inhibition than species B in the disk test. A graph plotting
MIC on one axis and zone diameter on the other provides
the correlation.
After incubating agar plates in the Kirby-Bauer test, the
diameters of the zones of inhibition around each disk are
measured, and the results are compared with a table listing
whether a zone is wide enough (meaning the MIC is low
enough) to be clinically useful. Table 27.1 shows susceptibility data for S. aureus. The concentration of antibiotic
used and the zone size that is considered clinically significant are correlated with the average attainable tissue level
for each antibiotic (discussed later). For the antibiotic to
remain effective in vivo, it is important that the tissue concentration of the drug remain above the MIC; otherwise,
invading bacteria will not be affected.

To ensure reproducibility, the Kirby-Bauer test was standardized over a half century ago. Reproducibility means
that results from a laboratory in California will match those
in Alabama, Ohio, or any other state. The following are
standardizations used to make the test reproducible and
easier.
■

Resistant

Size of the agar plate. The plates used (150 mm) are
larger than standard agar plates (100 mm) to accommodate more disks and to maintain sufficient distance
between disks so that zones of inhibition do not overlap.
Depth of the media. Antibiotics diffuse out of impregnated disks in three dimensions. Because diffusion cannot occur very far downward in a thinly poured agar, the
drug is forced to move more laterally. Thus, the zone of
inhibition measured from a thinly poured agar plate will
be larger than the zone from a thick agar plate.
Media composition. Media used for testing antibiotic susceptibility should lack para-aminobenzoic acid
(PABA), a compound used by cells to make the vitamin folic acid. Sulfonamide antibiotics are analogs of
PABA that inhibit folic acid synthesis. However, standard laboratory media, such as nutrient agar, contain
PABA. Grown on such a medium, the bacterial cell will
be flooded with PABA, which will limit the ability of
the sulfa drugs to inhibit growth. Thus, even though
the drug might be effective in vivo, on nutrient agar
there would be no zone of inhibition. The standardized
medium used for the Kirby-Bauer test, called MuellerHinton agar, contains no PABA.
The number of organisms spread on the agar plate.
The more organisms that are placed on a plate, the faster
visible growth will form. The faster visible growth forms,
the less time there is for an antibiotic to diffuse from a
disk to prevent growth. The result is that the diameter
of the zone of inhibition for an antibiotic is inversely

>12.5

proportional to the number of organisms used to seed
the agar plate. Thus, a standard optical density solution
of each organism is prepared, and a cotton swab is used
to spread organisms evenly over the entire agar surface.
■

Size of the disks. A standard diameter of 6 mm means
that all antibiotics start diffusing into the agar at the
same point.

■

Concentrations of antibiotics in the disks. The zone
of inhibition for an antibiotic is proportional to the concentration of antibiotic in the disk. The higher the concentration of antibiotic in a disk, the faster that drug can
diffuse through the plate and inhibit growth. To avoid
differences between labs, the concentration of each drug
impregnating a disk has been standardized.

■

Incubation temperature. Incubation temperature will
not affect growth and diffusion equally. To avoid differences, a temperature of 37°C is standard.

Automated MIC determinations. The

methods just
described to determine MIC are effective but take at least
24 hours to complete (the amount of time needed to see
visible turbidity in broth or growth on agar). Modern clinical laboratories are equipped with automated machines
(described in Chapter 28) that can determine an MIC
within 6 hours. This speed is critical to a clinician wanting
to quickly treat a serious infection with the most effective
drug. The instruments work by monitoring growth of the
infectious agent in microtiter plate wells and extrapolating
MIC from growth curves recorded at different antibiotic
concentrations.

Correlating antibiotic MIC with tissue level. The average

attainable tissue level for a drug depends on how quickly
the antibiotic is cleared from the body via secretion by
the kidney or destruction in the liver. It also depends on

level of ampicillin over time. The important consideration here is
how long the serum level of the antibiotic remains higher than the
MIC. Once the concentration falls below the MIC, owing to destruction in the liver or clearance through the kidneys and secretion, the
infectious agent fails to be controlled by the drug—in this case,
7–8 hours after the initial dose. To maintain a serum level higher
than the MIC, a second dose would be taken. The shaded area of the

in Figure 27.6 shows that as long as the concentration
of the drug in tissue or blood remains higher than the
MIC, the drug will be effective. The concentration can
be kept at sufficient levels either by administering a higher
dose, which runs the risk of side effects, or by giving a
second dose at a time when the levels from the fi rst dose
have declined. This is why patients are told to take doses
of some antibiotics four times a day and other antibiotics
only once a day.

Table 27.2 summarizes the general targets of common antibiotics. Chapters 3, 7, and 8 describe these cellular components and provide the basis for understanding
how antibiotics work. The mechanisms of action for antibiotics affecting DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis are
described in Chapters 7 and 8; they receive only brief
mention here.

Cell Wall Antibiotics

Bacterial cell walls are the basis of
selective toxicity for some antibiotics
because peptidoglycan does not exist
in mammalian cells; thus, antibiotics that target the synthesis of these
structures should selectively kill bacteria. The following case history
illustrates the use of two cell wall–
targeting antibiotics and also reveals
how bacteria can evolve to escape
destruction.

The diagnosis was meningitis. The physician immediately
prescribed intravenous ampicillin. Unfortunately, the child’s
condition worsened, so antibiotic treatment was changed to a

is made. Synthesis of peptidoglycan starts in the cytoplasm with a uridine diphosphate (UDP)–NAM molecule.
The amino acids L-alanine, D -glutamic acid, and L-lysine
[or diaminopimelic acid (DAP) in Gram-negative organisms] are individually and sequentially added to NAM
(Fig. 27.7, step 1); and then a dipeptide of D -alanine is
attached (step 2). Next, the NAM-pentapeptide is transferred to a membrane-situated, 55-carbon lipid molecule
called bactoprenol (step 3), releasing uridine monophosphate (UMP). This structure is also called lipid I. Another
sugar molecule, NAG, is then linked to NAM—once again
through a UDP intermediate (step 4)—to make the bactoprenol structure called lipid II. All of this takes place on the
cytoplasmic side of the membrane.
Bactoprenol then “flips,” moving NAM-NAG to the
outer side of the cytoplasmic membrane (Fig. 27.7,
step 5), where transpeptidases and transglycosylases (two
penicillin-binding proteins, or PBPs) bind to the D-AlaD -Ala part of the pentapeptide. Transglycosylase attaches
the new disaccharide unit to an existing peptidoglycan
chain (step 6). Transpeptidase then links two peptide

blood-brain barrier). The patient began to improve within
hours and was released after 2 days. A report from the clinical microbiology laboratory identified the organism as Streptococcus pneumoniae.
Both of the antibiotics used in this case kill bacteria by
targeting cell wall synthesis (introduced in Chapter 3). To
synthesize peptidoglycan, sugar molecules called N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM)
are made by the cell and linked together by a transglycosylase enzyme into long chains assembled at the cell
wall (Fig. 27.7). N-acetylmuramic acid contains a short
side chain of amino acids that is assembled enzymatically,
not by a ribosome. The side chains from adjacent strands
are cross-linked to make the structure rigid. The enzyme
transpeptidase (D-alanyl-D-alanine carboxypeptidase/
transpeptidase) catalyzes the cross-link. Several antibiotics
target various stages of this assembly process.

aureus). The pentaglycine connects L-Lys on one side chain and
the penultimate D-Ala on the other
side chain (step 7). The terminal
D -Ala is removed in the process.
Other bacteria do not use a pentaglycine cross-link, but directly
form a peptide bond between
L-Lys (DAP) and the penultimate
D -Ala.
Cross-linking strengthens the cell wall. In the last part
of the cycle, one of the phosphates
on the now liberated bactoprenol
is removed and the lipid moves
back to the cytoplasmic side of the
membrane, ready to pick up and
taxi another unit of peptidoglycan
to the growing chain (step 8).

which combine to form the betaMethicillin
lactam ring structure shown in
Figure 27.8A. Different R groups
can be added to the basic ring structure to change the antimicrobial spectrum and stability of
the derivative penicillin (Fig. 27.8B). Note that the betalactam ring of penicillin chemically resembles the D -Ala-D Ala piece of peptidoglycan (Fig. 27.8A). This molecular
mimicry allows the drug to bind transpeptidase, transglycosylase, and several other proteins involved in cell wall
synthesis or remodeling (which is why the proteins are
called penicillin-binding proteins). Penicillins act by inhibiting transpeptidase-mediated cross linking between adjacent peptidoglycan chains. This activity makes the cell wall
very weak. In addition, penicillins can somehow activate
proteins in the cell wall that hydrolyze peptidoglycan. The
consequence is a disaster for bacteria that are trying to
grow larger and larger. Eventually, the growing cell bursts
for lack of cell wall restraint. Penicillin, then, is a bactericidal drug (unless the treated organism is suspended in an
isotonic solution). Note that in addition to cell lysis, there
is another explanation for why penicillin and other bactericidal drugs kill bacteria, which we will discuss at the end
of this section.
Penicillin is more effective against Gram-positive than
Gram-negative organisms because the drug has difficulty

passing through the Gram-negative outer membrane.
Ampicillin, which was used in the case history, is a modified version of penicillin that more easily penetrates this
membrane and is more effective than penicillin against
Gram-negative microbes. Thus, ampicillin has a broader
spectrum of activity than penicillin.
Bacterial resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics. As noted

earlier, antibiotic resistance is a growing problem throughout the world. Bacteria develop resistance to penicillin in
two basic ways. The fi rst is through inheritance of a gene
encoding one of the beta-lactamase enzymes, which cleave
the critical ring structure of this class of antibiotics. Betalactamase is transported out of the cell and into the surrounding medium (for Gram-positives) or the periplasm
(for Gram-negatives), where it can destroy penicillin before
the drug even gets to the cell. Bacteria that produce betalactamase are still susceptible to certain modified penicillins
and cephalosporins engineered to be poor substrates for
the enzyme. Methicillin, for example, works well against
beta-lactamase-producing microbes.
Unfortunately, a type of beta-lactamase called New
Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) has emerged
that confers resistance to almost all beta-lactam antibiotics.
Originating in India, NDM-1-containing plasmids are promiscuously transferred, being found in various enterobacterial species, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli, as
well as the nonenteric pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa
and Acinetobacter baumannii.
Aside from beta-lactamases, the second way a microbe
can become resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics is by acquiring a gene encoding an altered penicillin binding protein that no longer binds penicillin. Methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) uses this strategy. Resistance to methicillin in S. aureus is mediated by the mecA
gene, which is part of a mobile genetic element called

CHAPTER 27

staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec). The
mecA gene encodes an altered penicillin-binding protein
(PBP2a or PBP2´) with low affinity for beta-lactam antibiotics. The low affinity provides resistance to all beta-lactam
antibiotics, rendering them useless. Hospitals take special
interest in MRSA because very few drugs can kill it.
One of the few remaining antibiotics effective against
MRSA is vancomycin. Unfortunately, resistance is developing to this drug too. Vancomycin-resistant S. aureus
strains are called VRSA. The penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae in the preceding case history actually had
an altered penicillin-binding protein. No beta-lactamaseproducing S. pneumoniae has yet been found.

Note:

Archaeal pseudopeptidoglycan contains talosaminuronic acid instead of muramic acid and lacks the D-amino acids
found in bacterial peptidoglycan. Archaea are thus insensitive to
penicillins, which interfere with bacterial transpeptidases. This
natural resistance is not a problem, because no archaea are known
to be pathogens.

Beta-lactamase-resistant antibiotics. Cephalosporins are

another type of beta-lactam antibiotic originally discovered
in nature but modified in the laboratory to fight microbes
that are naturally resistant to penicillins (especially Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Over the years, the structure of cephalosporin has undergone a series of modifications to improve
its effectiveness against penicillin-resistant pathogens. Each
modification adds complexity and produces what is called
a new “generation” of cephalosporins. There are currently
five generations of this semisynthetic antibiotic (Fig. 27.9).
Unfortunately, the microbial world continually adapts and
eventually becomes resistant to new antibiotics. In the case
of the cephalosporins, new beta-lactamases evolve that can
attack the sterically buried beta-lactam rings in these molecules. It is also important to note that because the core
feature of these drugs is the beta-lactam ring, persons who
are sensitive to penicillins may also suffer a hypersensitivity
reaction to cephalosporins.
Treatment note: In the preceding case history, the infecting strain of Streptococcus pneumoniae turned out to be
resistant to ampicillin. Had the patient been an adult, a fluoroquinolone (see Section 7.2) might have been the best
secondary drug of choice because its target, a type II topoisomerase, is unrelated to cell wall synthesis. Quinolones
are not recommended for children, as in this case, because
of potential side effects. Other beta-lactam antibiotics, such
as the third-generation cephalosporins, may still work on
penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, because the modified
antibiotic often can still bind the altered PBP. Nevertheless,
cephalosporin-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae are now
appearing, leaving vancomycin or an oxazolidinone as the
best last choice.

growing chain (see Fig. 27.7). Bacitracin binds to and inhibits dephosphorylation of the carrier, thereby preventing the
carrier from accepting a new unit of UDP-NAM. Resistance
to bacitracin can develop if the organism can rapidly recycle
the phosphorylated lipid carrier molecule through dephosphorylation or if the organism possesses an efficient drug
export system (discussed in Section 27.3). Normally, bacitracin is used only topically because of serious side effects, such
as kidney damage, which can occur if bacitracin is ingested.
Cycloserine (made by Streptomyces garyphalus) is one of several antimicrobials used to treat tuberculosis (Fig. 27.10B).
Relative to bacitracin, it acts at an even earlier step in peptidoglycan synthesis. Cycloserine inhibits the two enzymes that
make the D -Ala-D -Ala dipeptide. As a result, the complete
pentapeptide side chain on N-acetylmuramic acid cannot be
made (see Fig. 27.7). Without these alanines, cross-linking
cannot occur and peptidoglycan integrity is compromised.
Vancomycin, a very large and complex glycopeptide
produced by the streptomycete Amycolatopsis orientalis
(Fig. 27.10C), binds to the D -Ala-D -Ala terminal end of
the disaccharide unit and prevents the action of transglycosylases and transpeptidases (see Fig. 27.7). The mechanism
of resistance is very different for vancomycin and penicillin, which makes vancomycin particularly useful against
penicillin-resistant bacteria. To prevent the development
and spread of vancomycin-resistant bacteria, this antibiotic
is typically used only as a drug of last resort.
Resistance to vancomycin can develop when products
from a cluster of van genes collaborate to make D -lactate and incorporate it into the ester D -Ala-D -lactate, to
which vancomycin cannot bind. Another enzyme in the

van gene cluster prevents the accumulation of D -Ala-D Ala; as a result, D -Ala-D -lactate replaces D -Ala-D -Ala in
peptidoglycan. Peptidoglycan containing D -Ala-D -lactate
functions just fine, but the organism is resistant to the
antibiotic because vancomycin cannot bind the D -lactate
form. However, the antibiotic teixobactin, discussed in
Special Topic 4.1, will bind to the D -Ala-D -lactate form
and stop growth of vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive
bacteria.
Note that antibiotics targeting cell wall biosynthesis
generally kill only growing cells. These drugs do not affect
static or stationary-phase cells, because in this state the cell
has no need for new peptidoglycan.

Thought Question

27.5 When treating a patient for an infection, why would

combining a drug such as erythromycin with a penicillin be
counterproductive? (Erythromycin is described in Section 8.3.)

Drugs That Affect Bacterial
Membrane Integrity

Poking holes in a bacterial cytoplasmic membrane is an
effective way to kill bacteria. There are a few compounds
useful in this regard, among them a group called the
peptide antibiotics, of which gramicidin is an example.
Produced by Bacillus brevis, gramicidin is a cyclic peptide composed of 15 alternating D- and L-amino acids. It
inserts into the membrane as a dimer, forming a cation

Case History: Pneumonia Due to
a Gram-Negative Anaerobe
Gramicidin

Lipid bilayer

A 23-year-old woman arrived at the emergency room by
ambulance with fever, chills, and severe muscle aches. She
developed a nonproductive cough, had difficulty breathing,
had pleuritic chest pain, and became hypotensive (had low
blood pressure). An X-ray showed lower-lobe infiltrate in the
lungs, and the clinical laboratory reported the presence of the
Gram-negative anaerobe Fusobacterium necrophorum in
blood cultures. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia
and treated with metronidazole, a DNA-damaging agent
specific for anaerobes. She fully recovered.
There are several classes of drugs, including sulfa drugs,
quinolones, and metronidazole, that selectively affect the
synthesis or integrity of DNA in microorganisms.
Sulfa drugs. The sulfa drugs, originally discovered by Ger-

channel that disrupts membrane polarity (Fig. 27.11).
Polymyxin (from Bacillus polymyxa), another polypeptide
antibiotic, has a positively charged polypeptide ring that
binds to the outer (lipid A) and inner membranes of bacteria, both of which are negatively charged. Its major lethal
effect seems to be to destroy the inner membrane, much
like a detergent. These antibiotics are used only topically
to treat or prevent infection. Because they can also form
channels across human cell membranes, they should never
be ingested. Polymyxin has been fused to some bandage
materials used to treat burn patients, who are particularly
susceptible to Gram-negative infections (for example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Despite the drug’s toxicity, polymyxin or colistin can be injected as a drug of last resort
to treat certain multidrug-resistant bacterial infections (for
instance, Klebsiella pneumoniae).
Daptomycin is a lipopeptide made by Streptomyces
roseosporus using nonribosomal peptide synthetases. The
drug aggregates in the membranes of Gram-positive bacteria to form an ion channel that leaks potassium ions. The
resulting membrane depolarization leads to cell death. This
drug is very effective against MRSA.

Drugs That Affect DNA
Synthesis and Integrity

Bacteria generally make and maintain their DNA using
enzymes that closely resemble those of mammals. Thus,
you might think it impossible to selectively target bacterial
DNA synthesis, but it is possible, as you will see.

hard Domagk, belong to a group of drugs known as antimetabolites because they interfere with the synthesis of
metabolic intermediates. Ultimately, sulfa drugs inhibit the
synthesis of nucleic acids. Drugs such as sulfamethoxazole
or sulfanilamide work at the metabolic level to prevent the
synthesis of tetrahydrofolic acid (THF), an important cofactor in the synthesis of nucleic acid precursors (Fig. 27.12).
All organisms use THF to synthesize nucleic acids, so why
are the sulfa drugs selectively toxic to bacteria? The selectivity occurs because mammals do not synthesize folic acid, a
precursor of THF. Higher mammals generally rely on bacteria and green leafy vegetables as sources of folic acid. Bacteria make folic acid from the combination of PABA, glutamic
acid, and pteridine. Sulfanilamide (SFA), a structural analog
of PABA, competes for one of the enzymes in the bacterial
folic acid pathway and inhibits both folic acid and THF production (Fig. 27.12C). Because humans lack that pathway,
sulfa drugs are selectively toxic toward bacteria.
Quinolones. Another group of drugs inhibits DNA syn-

thesis by targeting microbial topoisomerases such as DNA
gyrase and topoisomerase IV (the mechanism is discussed
in Section 7.2). Because these enzymes are structurally distinct from their mammalian counterparts, drugs can be
designed to selectively interact with them while not interfering with mammalian DNA metabolism. One such drug,
nalidixic acid, was discovered in 1963. The drug targets
bacterial DNA gyrase but has a very narrow antimicrobial spectrum, covering only a few Gram-negative organisms. However, adding various chemical modifications
to nalidixic acid, such as fluorine and amine groups, has
increased its antimicrobial spectrum and its half-life in
the bloodstream. The result is the class of drugs known as
the quinolones. (The mode of action of quinolones and
fluoroquinolones was discussed in Section 7.2.)

■ Mode of action of sulfanilamides. A. The structures of PABA and sulfanilamide are very similar. B. PABA, pteridine, and
glutamic acid combine to make the vitamin folic acid. C. Normal synthesis of folic acid requires that all three components engage the active
site of the biosynthetic enzyme. The sulfa drugs replace PABA at the active site. The sulfur group, however, will not form a peptide bond with
glutamic acid, and the size of sulfanilamide sterically hinders the binding of pteridine, so folic acid cannot be made.

Metronidazole. Also known as Flagyl, metronidazole is an

example of a prodrug—a drug that is harmless until activated. Metronidazole is activated after it receives an electron (is reduced) from the microbial protein cofactors
flavodoxin and ferredoxin, found in microaerophilic and
anaerobic bacteria such as Bacteroides (Fig. 27.13). Once
activated, the compound begins nicking DNA at random,
thus killing the cell. Because the etiological agent in our
case history was an anaerobe, metronidazole was an effective therapy. Metronidazole is also effective against protozoa such as Giardia, Trichomonas, and Entamoeba. Aerobic
microbes, although in possession of ferredoxin, are incapable of reducing metronidazole, presumably because oxygen
is reduced in preference to metronidazole.

Thought Question

27.6 The enzyme DNA gyrase, a target of the quinolone antibiotics, is an essential protein in DNA replication. The quinolones bind to and inactivate this protein. Research has proved
that quinolone-resistant mutants contain mutations in the
gene encoding DNA gyrase. If the resistant mutants contain a
mutant DNA gyrase and DNA gyrase is essential for growth,
then why are these mutations not lethal?

RNA Synthesis Inhibitors

The mode of action of antibiotics that inhibit transcription, such as rifampin and actinomycin D (Fig. 27.14),
was described in Chapter 8. These drugs are bactericidal
and are most active against growing bacteria. The tricyclic
ring of actinomycin D binds DNA from any source. As a
result, it is not selectively toxic and not used to treat infections. Rifampin (also called rifampicin), on the other hand,
does exhibit selective toxicity for bacterial RNA polymerase
and is often prescribed for the treatment of tuberculosis or
meningococcal meningitis. Curiously, because rifampin is
reddish orange, it turns bodily secretions, including breast
milk, orange. The astute physician will warn the patient of
this highly visible but harmless side effect to avoid unnecessary anxiety when the patient’s urine changes color.
Until recently, rifampin was the only clinically useful
antibiotic known to directly target bacterial RNA polymerase (RNAP). Rifampin binding to RNAP prevents transcription only after the enzyme has started polymerization
(it obstructs the exit tunnel for nascent RNA, as described
in Chapter 8). Unfortunately, rifampin resistance has developed. However, two new classes of antibiotics have been discovered. Pyronins, represented by myxopyronin (produced

by Myxococcus fulvis), prevent RNAP
from ever starting polymerization. The
pyronins bind to RNA polymerase at
a site called the hinge region, which is
needed to separate (melt) DNA strands—
a requirement to begin transcription.
The second drug, lipiarmycin, is an
unusual macrolide antibiotic made by Actinoplanes deccanensis. Lipiarmycin binds
to the same region as myxopyronin but
completely stops closed RNA polymerase–
DNA complexes from transitioning to the
open forms. Because the binding site for
rifampin is different from those of the other
two antibiotics, rifampin-resistant RNAP
molecules are still sensitive to the new antibiotics. This is exciting because pathogens
such as rifampin-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or Clostridioides difficile can now be treated with a new drug
that targets the same enzyme. Lipiarmycin
has been approved by the FDA to treat C.
difficile–associated diarrhea.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Most of these antibiotics work by binding and interfering with
the function of bacterial rRNA, which differs from eukaryotic rRNA. Recall, too, that protein synthesis inhibitors are,
by and large, bacteriostatic (not bactericidal).

Case History: Erysipelas in a
Penicillin-Sensitive Patient

Sixteen-year-old Jamal arrived at the emergency room after
2 days of fever, malaise, chills, and neck stiffness. His most notable symptom was a painful, red, rapidly spreading rash covering
the right side of his face. The rash covered his entire cheek, which
was swollen, and extended into his scalp. About 7 days earlier,
Jamal had had a severe sore throat. Because it had subsided in
2 days, however, he was not clinically evaluated. Throat cultures taken on admission revealed group A Streptococcus pyogenes, suggesting that the rash was a case of erysipelas caused by
this organism. Although penicillin would be the drug of choice,
Jamal was known to be allergic to this antibiotic.
When a patient is known to be immunologically sensitive
to the usual drug of choice, a structurally distinct drug
is best. Often, that drug will be one that inhibits protein
synthesis; in this case, the drug chosen was the macrolide
azithromycin. Drugs that inhibit protein synthesis can be
subdivided into different groups based on their structures
and on which part of the translation machine is targeted.

specific mutations in mitochondrial rRNA are more susceptible to aminoglycoside toxicity.
Tetracyclines. Tetracycline antibiotics are characterized by a

structure with four fused cyclic rings—hence the name. Figure 27.15B shows one frequently used example, called doxycycline. Tetracyclines are bacteriostatic and work by binding
to and distorting the ribosomal A site that accepts incoming charged tRNA molecules. Doxycycline is used to treat
early stages of Lyme disease (caused by Borrelia burgdorferi),
acne (Propionibacterium acnes), and other infections. An
important adverse side effect of tetracyclines is that they can
interfere with bone development in a fetus or young child.
Tetracycline use by pregnant mothers will also cause yellow
discoloration of the infant’s teeth. As a result, this drug is
not recommended for pregnant women or nursing mothers.

Drugs That Affect the 50S Subunit

Five classes of drugs subvert translation by binding to the
50S ribosomal subunit. Most of these drugs were discussed
in Chapter 8 and are recapped here only briefly.
■

Macrolides, all of which contain a 14- to 16-member lactone ring (Fig. 27.15C), inhibit translocation of the growing peptide (bacteriostatic action). Commonly prescribed
examples are erythromycin and azithromycin. Azithromycin was the antibiotic used to treat the Streptococcus pyogenes infection in our case history, although other drugs
could have been used. Because it is structurally dissimilar
to any of the beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, it
can be used safely in patients who are penicillin sensitive.

■

Lincosamides (Fig. 27.15D), such as clindamycin, are
similar to macrolides in function but have a different
structure.

■

Chloramphenicol (Fig. 27.15E) inhibits peptidyltransferase activity (bacteriostatic). Bone marrow depression
leading to aplastic anemia is the most common serious
side effect and limits its clinical use.

■

Oxazolidinones (Fig. 27.15F) are a recently discovered class of synthetic antibiotics effective against many
antibiotic-resistant microbes. In fact, this was the first
new class of antibiotics discovered since the “golden age”
of antibiotic discovery over 35 years ago. Oxazolidinones
such as linezolid bind to the 23S rRNA in the 50S subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome and prevent formation
of the protein synthesis 70S initiation complex. This is a
novel mode of action; other protein synthesis inhibitors
either block polypeptide extension or cause misreading of
mRNA. Linezolid binds to the 50S subunit near where
chloramphenicol binds, but it does not inhibit peptidyltransferase. Resistance is limited because most bacterial

Drugs That Affect the 30S Subunit

The classification of antibiotics affecting protein synthesis is
initially based on the bacterial ribosomal subunit targeted.
Thus, one class of antibiotics interferes with 30S subunit
function, and the other scrambles 50S subunit activities.
Aminoglycosides. There is considerable variation in structure among different aminoglycosides, but all contain a
cyclohexane ring and amino sugars (Fig. 27.15A). The aminoglycosides are unusual among protein synthesis inhibitors
in that they are bactericidal rather than bacteriostatic. Most
of them bind 16S rRNA and cause translational misreading of mRNA, which is why these drugs are bactericidal (see
another explanation below). The resulting synthesis of jumbled peptides wreaks havoc with physiology and kills the cell.
Streptomycin and gentamicin (Fig. 27.15A) are two
widely used drugs in this class. Ototoxicity (hearing damage) is a major, but uncommon, side effect of these antibiotics (approximately 0.5%–3% of patients treated with
gentamicin suffer from this toxicity). Hearing is generally
affected at frequencies above 4,000 Hz. The toxicity of
aminoglycosides appears related to their ability to inhibit
the function of mitochondrial ribosomes, which are evolutionarily related to bacterial ribosomes. Individuals with

genomes have multiple operons encoding 23S rRNA.
Usually more than one of these genes must mutate to
confer high-level resistance. The more mutant 23S rRNA
genes there are relative to native 23S genes, the more
oxazolidinone-resistant ribosomes will be present. Oxazolidinones are useful primarily against Gram-positive
bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria are intrinsically resistant
because of multidrug efflux pumps (see Section 27.3)
and decreased permeability due to the outer membrane.

because the A-type streptogramin alters the binding site
for the B-type drug, increasing its affinity. Bacteria can
develop resistance through ribosomal modification (the
modification in 23S rRNA is the same one that provides
resistance to macrolides), via the production of inactivating enzymes, or by active efflux of the antibiotic.

Streptogramins (Fig. 27.16), produced by some Streptomyces species, fall into two groups, designated A and
B. Streptogramins belonging to group A have a large
nonpeptide ring (Fig. 27.16A), whereas streptogramin
B members are cyclic peptides (Fig. 27.16B). The two
groups differ in their modes of action, although both
inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the peptidyltransferase site. Group A streptogramins bind to the
peptidyltransferase site and prevent binding of tRNA
to the ribosome A site. In contrast, group B streptogramins are thought to narrow the peptide exit channel, preventing exit of the peptide and thereby blocking
translocation. Natural streptogramins are produced
as a mixture of A and B, the combination of which is
more potent than either individual compound alone
(an example of synergy). In tribute to this synergistic
action, the drug combination is marketed under the
name Synercid. Synergy between the two drugs occurs

Bactericidal antibiotics include quinolones that bind to
DNA topoisomerases; aminoglycosides that bind to the
30S ribosome subunit; rifampin, which binds to RNA
polymerase; and penicillins that inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis. While these antimicrobials do halt critical cell processes, other antibiotics that inhibit some of these same
processes are not bactericidal. For example, aminoglycosides and macrolides inhibit protein synthesis, but macrolides do not typically kill bacteria.
A new theory attempts to explain why particular antibiotics are bactericidal. Put simply, a common consequence of the
modes of action for bactericidal antibiotics is the generation
of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals, which damage DNA, protein, and lipids, leading to cell death. Partial evidence for this
model came when James J. Collins and colleagues found that
they could make cells more sensitive to bactericidal antibiotics by preventing induction of the SOS response that limits
and repairs oxidative damage to DNA (see Section 9.4). The
antibiotics would still inhibit growth but not kill the cells. A
practical consequence of this finding is that determining how
to inhibit the SOS response by pathogens could make them
more susceptible to antibiotic therapy.

antibiotic and cephalosporin be synergistic?

Antibiotic specificity for bacteria can be achieved by
targeting a process that occurs only in bacteria, not host
cells; by targeting small structural differences between
components of a process shared by bacteria and hosts; or
by exploiting a physiological condition such as anaerobiosis present only in certain bacteria.
Antibiotic targets include cell wall synthesis, cell membrane integrity, DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, protein
synthesis, and metabolism.

Risky Business: Why Do
Microbes Make Antibiotics?

Antibiotics are considered secondary metabolites because
they often have no apparent primary use in the producing
organism. This most likely means that a purpose, either current or ancestral, has yet to be identified. Certainly, antibiotic
production today can help one microbe compete favorably
with another in nature. Antibiotic production can also forge
a mutualistic relationship between a microbe and a colonized host by protecting the host from deadly pathogens (as
Streptomyces does for leaf-cutter ants; see Section 18.3 and
eTopic 17.4). Whatever their use today, growth inhibition by
antibiotics may not have been the original purpose of secondary metabolite production. The complexity of the biosynthetic
pathways involved in making antibiotics suggests a more
immediate purpose—for example, cell-cell signaling—that
evolved into cross-species inhibition. Features of antibiotic
biosynthetic pathways are discussed in eTopic 27.2 (penicillin
synthesis) and eTopic 15.4 (vancomycin biosynthesis).
Given that microbes continue to make antibiotics for
a reason, how does the producing microorganism avoid

committing suicide? Fungi that make penicillin face no
consequence for having done so because the organism does
not contain peptidoglycan. Actinomycetes that produce
compounds such as streptomycin or chloramphenicol, however, could be susceptible to their own secondary metabolite. Ribosomes isolated from Streptomyces griseus, for
example, are fully sensitive to the streptomycin produced
by this organism.

CHAPTER 27

S. griseus avoids killing itself in two ways. First, the
organism synthesizes an inactive precursor of streptomycin, 6-phosphorylstreptomycin, which is secreted from
the cell and, once outside the mycelium, becomes
activated by a specific phosphatase. In addition, this
streptomycete has an enzyme that inactivates anyy
streptomycin that may leak back into the mycelium. Other organisms protect themselves by
methylating key residues on their rRNA to prevent drug binding or by setting up permeability
barriers that thwart reentry of the antibiotic.
These and other strategies of self-preservation employed by antibiotic-producing microbes
are clever. Unfortunately, these mechanisms
have been shared via horizontal gene transfers, making many pathogens antibiotic resistant. Horizontal gene transfers are discussed in
Sections 9.6 and 25.2.

Case History: MultidrugResistant Pneumonia

A 14-year-old boy with fever (39°C; 102.2°F), chills,
and left-sided pleuritic chest pain was referred too
a hospital emergency department by his generall
practitioner. A chest X-ray showed left-lower-lobee
pneumonia. The boy reported that he was allergicc
to amoxicillin and cephalosporins (as a child he had
d
developed a rash in response to these agents) and had
d
been taking daily doxycycline (tetracycline) for the pre-vious 3 months to treat mild acne. He was admitted too
the hospital and treated with intravenous azithromycin
(a macrolide antibiotic) because of his reported beta-lactam
allergies, but he continued to feel sick. The day after admission, both sputum and blood cultures grew Streptococcus
pneumoniae. After 48 hours, antibiotic susceptibility results
indicated that the microbe was resistant to penicillin, azithromycin, and tetracycline. Armed with this information, the
clinician immediately changed antibiotic treatment to vancomycin. The boy’s fever resolved over the next 12 hours, and he
made a slow but full recovery over the next week.
Unfortunately, the scenario presented in this case is far
too common and has become an extremely serious concern. Figure 27.17 shows the rapid rise of penicillin resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae strains in the world.
Another instance of emerging antibiotic resistance is unfolding in Europe and the Far East. The non-Enterobacteriaceae
Gram-negative rod Acinetobacter baumannii is increasingly
seen as a dangerous cause of nosocomial infections. It commonly colonizes hospitalized patients, particularly those
in intensive care units. Before 1998, there were almost no
cases of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii. The rate is now

as high as 8%. The organism is resistant to drugs as diverse
as ciprofloxacin (a quinolone), amikacin (an aminoglycoside), penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, tetracycline, and chloramphenicol. Imipenem, one of a relatively
new class of beta-lactam drugs, is currently useful, but resistance to it is also likely to develop.
There are four basic forms of antibiotic resistance
(Fig. 27.18). The resistant organism can:

Destroy the antibiotic before it enters the cell. For

enzyme are illustrated in Figure 27.19.

channel connected to the pump protein, and an accessory
protein that may link the other two proteins. For instance,
the AcrAB transporter (Fig. 27.22) almost indiscriminately binds antibiotics in a large central cavity within AcrB
(a promiscuous binding site) and uses proton motive force
to move those compounds through the AcrB pore and
out a funnel (AcrA) that connects to an outer membrane
channel, TolC.
Antibiotic efflux pumps contribute significantly to bacterial antibiotic resistance because of the very broad variety
of substrates they recognize and because of their expression in important pathogens. Strains of the pathogen
Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for instance, have developed
multidrug-resistant phenotypes in part because of MDR
pumps. Approximately 2 million people die from tuberculosis annually, mostly in developing nations. What is even
more alarming is that an increasing number of M. tuberculosis strains isolated from patients exhibit multidrug resistance. Although most of the antibiotic resistance in the
majority of M. tuberculosis multidrug-resistant strains is

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

due to the accumulation of independent mutations in several genes, MDR pumps are thought to increase the level of
resistance. Chemists typically try to tweak the structure of
an antibiotic to overcome a specific type of resistance mechanism, but the MDR pumps act on an exceptionally wide
range of antibiotics, almost without regard to structure.

How Does Drug Resistance Develop?

As discussed in previous chapters, nature has engineered
a certain degree of flexibility in the way genomes are replicated and passed from one generation to the next. DNA
repair pathways involving lesion bypass polymerases (for
example, UmuDC; see Section 9.4) are thought to play a
large role in randomized adaptive and evolutionary processes. For instance, at some point during evolution, gene
duplication and mutational reshaping generated a gene
product able to cleave the beta-lactam ring, producing an
organism resistant to penicillin.
However, de novo antibiotic resistance through gene
duplication and/or mutation does not occur in all species.
Why reinvent the wheel—or, in this case, drug resistance?
Gene transfer mechanisms such as conjugation, described
in Chapter 9, can move antibiotic resistance genes from
one organism to another and from one species to another.
In fact, several drug resistance genes found in pathogenic
bacteria actually had their start in the chromosomes of the
drug-producing organisms and were passed on through
gene swapping. For instance, Streptomyces clavuligerus produces a beta-lactamase (encoded by the bla gene) that protects this organism from the penicillin it produces. Transfer
of a drug resistance gene is particularly evident if the gene
has been incorporated into a plasmid and that plasmid is
found in a new species.
Antibiotic resistance within uncontacted communities.

Insight about the origins of antibiotic resistance in our
human microbiome was provided in 2015 by Maria
Dominguez-Bello (New York University and the University of Puerto Rico) and her collaborators, who reported
on the fecal, oral, and skin microbiomes of uncontacted
Amerindians in the Amazon. The Amerindians had no previous contact with Westerners who could be a source of
antibiotic-resistant microbes, or to antibiotics that could
provide selective pressure to develop antibiotic resistance.
Without such contact, you might expect the microbiomes
of this culture to lack antibiotic resistance genes. You would
be wrong.
What the scientists found by DNA sequencing was that
bacteria in the Amerindian microbiome did contain antibiotic resistance genes, possibly obtained by exchange with
antibiotic-producing soil microbes. To test their functionality, the genes were cloned, placed under the control of

a constitutive plasmid promoter to ensure expression, and
transferred to E. coli. Many of the Amerindian microbiome genes conferred resistance to natural as well as synthetic antibiotics. The authors, however, suspect that many
of these genes are silenced in the native microbes of the
Amerindian microbiota. Yet introduction of antibiotic
selective pressure could readily select for regulatory mutations that activate those genes.
It is also worth noting that the microbiomes of the
Amerindians were unprecedented in their high bacterial
and functional diversity. The diversity is thought to have
developed, at least in part, in response to the more intimate
contact that Amerindians have with the natural environment compared to Westerners.
Multidrug-resistant pathogens. An interesting case study

of antibiotic resistance is provided by the Gram-positive
bacterium Enterococcus faecalis, a natural inhabitant of
the mammalian gastrointestinal tract that can cause lifethreatening disease if granted access to other body sites (as
in subacute bacterial endocarditis; see Section 26.6). E. faecalis is naturally resistant to numerous antibiotics, making
disease treatment particularly challenging.
Vancomycin is one of the last lines of defense for treating serious E. faecalis infections. Unfortunately, increasing
numbers of vancomycin-resistant strains (called VREs) have
arisen in recent years. The completed genome sequence
of one vancomycin-resistant strain illustrates the reason.
The organism has an incredible propensity for incorporating mobile genetic elements that encode drug resistance.
About a quarter of the genome consists of mobile or exogenously acquired DNA, including 7 probable phages, 38
insertion elements, numerous transposons, and integrated
plasmid genes. One such mobile element encodes vancomycin resistance in the sequenced strain.
Multidrug resistance in various microbes (for example,
Salmonella enterica) has also been attributed to the presence of integrons. Integrons are gene expression elements
that account for rapid transmission of drug resistance
because of their mobility and ability to collect resistance
gene cassettes (see eTopic 9.5).
We should note that the development of antibiotic resistance is not without consequence to the bacterium. Altering one aspect of an organism’s physiology for the better
may weaken another area. Bacteria may become resistant to
a certain antibiotic, but that resistance comes at a price. For
example, the altered DNA gyrase that affords resistance
to quinolones may not function as well as the “normal”
gyrase does. Thus, when both resistant and susceptible
organisms cohabit the same environment, the wild-type
(sensitive) strain may grow faster and eventually overwhelm
the mutant strain—unless fluoroquinolone is present, of
course.

CHAPTER 27

Methods to Identify DrugResistant Pathogens

The faster a clinical laboratory can identify a pathogen’s
antibiotic susceptibility pattern, the more quickly a clinician can prescribe a narrow-spectrum antibiotic. The traditional MIC method described in Section 27.1 can take
3 days—one day to grow the organism on an agar plate
from a clinical sample, one day to prep the MIC tubes, and
another day for the organisms to grow and for the technician to read the results. The automated MIC can cut
one day off of that timeline. Meanwhile, the seriously ill
patient is subjected to empiric therapy in which very broadspectrum antibiotics—sometimes two or three drugs—are
used to “cover” as many pathogens as possible until the
organism’s identity and antibiotic susceptibility pattern are
known.
Fortunately, more rapid tests that can provide answers
in less than a day are slowly being introduced into the
clinical laboratory. For instance, multiplex PCR platforms are available that can detect pathogen-specific or
drug resistance genes within an hour directly from respiratory or stool samples. A miniature magnetic resonance
machine has also been developed that can detect pathogens at concentrations as low as one organism per milliliter of blood within a few hours. Combining these
technologies could mean that a sample brought to the
lab at 8 a.m. could be ready by lunch. Such speed could
quickly lead to more focused, pathogen-directed therapy.
Unfortunately, we have a long way to go before realizing
this ideal.

How Did We Get into This Mess?

Consider the following case: A grandmother brings
her 4-year-old grandchild to the physician. The child
is screaming because he has an extremely painful sore
throat. Simply looking at the throat is not diagnostic. The
raw tissue could mean the child is suffering from a bacterial infection, in which case antibiotics are needed. Alternatively, a virus could be the cause—a situation in which
antibiotics do nothing but pacify the grandparent, or parent. More often than not, the clinician will prescribe an
antibiotic without ever knowing the cause of disease. The
problem is this: The more an antibiotic is used, the more
opportunities there are to select for an antibiotic-resistant
organism.
The presence of drug does not cause resistance, but it
will kill off or inhibit the growth of competing bacteria
that are sensitive, thereby allowing the resistant organism
to grow to high numbers. Resistance can form not only
in the pathogen itself, but also in a member of the normal
microbiota. The danger, then, is that the gene imparting

■

resistance might be horizontally transferred to other
bacteria—some of them pathogens. A study in 2016 from
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that
nearly one in three antibiotic prescriptions in the United
States is inappropriate. For acute respiratory infections,
only half of the prescriptions for antibiotics were deemed
appropriate.
When should antimicrobials be administered? Certainly,
in life-threatening situations where time is of the essence,
antibiotics should be administered even before the cause
of the infection is known. On the other hand, the most
prudent course to take when a patient has a simple infection is to confirm a bacterial etiology, and then prescribe.
An exception may be in an elderly or otherwise immunocompromised individual, who may be more susceptible to
secondary bacterial infections that can occur subsequent to
viral disease.
Another proposed source of antibiotic resistance is
the widespread practice of adding antibiotics to animal
feed. Giving animals subtherapeutic doses of antibiotics
in their food makes for larger, and therefore more profitable, animals. The reason antibiotics promote livestock
growth is unclear but may be the result of altering the
diversity of gut microbiota. Some estimates suggest that
80% of all antibiotics used in the United States are fed
to healthy livestock. The consequence is that the animals
may serve as incubators for the development of antibiotic
resistance. Even if the resistance develops in nonpathogens, the antibiotic genes produced can be transferred to
pathogens.
Feeding growth-promoting antibiotics to cattle can
also stimulate the spread of pathogenicity genes between
bacteria. The antibiotics are added to feed at subinhibitory concentrations that do not kill the bacteria, but stress
them instead. Stress can trigger SOS responses (see Chapter 9) that reactivate prophages embedded into bacterial chromosomes. If those phages carry toxin genes, the
new phage can transfer toxin production to new strains
or species cohabiting the intestine. For example, the
Shiga toxin genes (stx) carried by certain pathovars of
E. coli are associated with prophage genomes. Growthpromoting antibiotics such as carbadox [methyl-3(2-quinoxalinylmethylene)-carbazate-N1, N 4-dioxide] or
monensin (not used in humans) have been shown to reactivate these stx-carrying prophages and foster distribution
of stx to other strains. The unusual O104:H4 Shiga toxin–
producing E. coli that in 2011 caused a European outbreak
of hemolytic uremic syndrome may have been generated
by this mechanism. Bradley Bearson of the National Laboratory for Agriculture and the Environment (Ames, Iowa)
has also shown that carbadox will induce prophage replication in pathogenic Salmonella and Shigella strains. The
phage can subsequently transfer virulence or antibiotic

resistance genes to other bacteria (Fig. 27.23). Efforts to
curb the addition of antibiotics to animal feed have been
under way since the 1960s.
Many, or all, of these events conspired to produce an
incredibly dangerous bacterium that is resistant to almost
every antibiotic known. The organism, a Klebsiella pneumoniae, was first isolated in 2008 in Örebro, Sweden,
from a Swedish citizen returning from New Delhi, India
(Fig. 27.24). This organism is resistant to most commonly

used antibiotics, such as aminopenicillins, beta-lactam/
beta-lactamase inhibitors, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins, tigecycline (structurally similar to
tetracycline), and carbapenems. It carries the NDM-1 plasmid noted earlier, and numerous other antibiotic resistance
genes. Despite attempted treatment with linezolid, the
patient died.
The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA)
coined the term ESK APE pathogens almost a decade ago,
referring to the six bacterial species that collectively cause
about two-thirds of all U.S. nosocomial infections and
have effectively escaped the ability to be treated by existing
drugs. These bacteria are Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species.
Considerable effort has been made to identify new antibiotics capable of killing or stopping the growth of these
pathogens.

the antibiotic resistance gene blaNDM-1 is emerging as a dangerous,
drug-resistant pathogen.

Several strategies are being used to stay one step ahead of
drug-resistant pathogens. In some instances, dummy target
compounds that inactivate resistance enzymes have been
developed. Clavulanic acid, for example, is a compound

CHAPTER 27

sometimes used in combination with penicillins such as
amoxicillin. Clavulanic acid is a beta-lactam compound
with no antimicrobial effect. It is, however, a chemical
decoy that competitively binds to beta-lactamases secreted
from penicillin-resistant bacteria. Because the enzyme
releases bound clavulanic acid very slowly, the amoxicillin remains free to enter and kill the bacterium. Another
strategy is to alter the structure of the antibiotic in a way
that sterically hinders the access of modifying enzymes.
Figure 27.25 illustrates how adding a side chain to gentamicin, converting it to amikacin, blocks the activity of various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes. Of course, we are
now seeing resistance to amikacin developing (this resistance is ribosome based, involving mutational alteration of
the S12 protein or 16S rRNA).

Linking antibiotics is another strategy currently used to
limit resistance. Recent advances have been made in linking
a quinolone to an oxazolidinone to form a hybrid antibiotic with dual modes of action (Fig. 27.26). Because it has
two modes of action, this hybrid antibiotic may limit the
development of antibiotic resistance. Here’s why: The rate
of spontaneous resistance to a given antibiotic is roughly
one out of 107 cells. For spontaneous resistance to develop
to two antibiotics, that probability rises to one out of 1014,
making it very unlikely that an organism can become doubly drug resistant. However, multidrug resistance efflux
pumps, integron cassettes, and plasmids carrying multiple
antibiotic resistance genes can overwhelm that approach.
Scientists are also thinking “outside the box” by developing new, more pathogen-specific, antimicrobials. One
such avenue, described in Special Topic 27.1, involves synthetically engineering bispecific antibodies that contain
binding sites for two different virulence factors.

Why do some infections return after bactericidal antibiotic treatment is discontinued? The reason is a subpopulation of dormant organisms, called persister cells, that
arise within a population of antibiotic-susceptible bacteria.
The stalled metabolism of persisters renders them tolerant
to bactericidal antibiotics during treatment. Removing the
drug allows persisters to grow and reestablish infection.
The strategy is analogous to a hiker’s tactic, on accidentally encountering a bear in the woods, of “playing dead”
to avoid being attacked.
Persistence is a long-recognized mystery of microbiology.
Joseph Bigger in 1944 noticed that penicillin would lyse a
growing culture of Staphylococcus aureus, but a small number of persister cells always survived. These persisters were not
mutants made permanently resistant through mutation. They
acted as though dormant. Persister cells that tolerate antibiotic
treatment can be found in any biofilm or population of lateexponential-phase cells. In addition to causing antibiotic treatment failures, persistence may be the reason for latent bacterial
infections such as recrudescent typhus or latent tuberculosis.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

SPECIAL TOPIC 27.1-- Are Designer Antibodies the Next Antibiotics?
The use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat an infectious
disease could be called the “nuclear option” of antimicrobial
therapy. Not only do these antibiotics kill the intended pathogen, but they also wipe out much of our microbiota. Nearly
indiscriminate clinical use of broad-spectrum antibiotics has
spawned widespread resistance to all classes of antimicrobials, sparking fear that we are fast approaching a postantibiotic
world in which traditional antibiotics no longer work. The situation, though dire, has fostered interest in developing new,
more focused, pathogen-specific antimicrobial strategies to
treat infections—something that would minimize the use of
broad-spectrum antibiotics. One such option is monoclonal
antibody technology.
A monoclonal antibody (mAb) originates from a single
antibody-producing B-cell clone and is specific for a single
epitope. Once identified in the laboratory, a B cell that produces a desired antibody is fused to an immortal line of cancer
cells. The result, called a hybridoma, can live indefinitely and
secrete antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies on demand.
Monoclonal antibodies directed against virulence factors can
disrupt a target microbe’s pathogenesis and facilitate clearance of the pathogen by the immune system (for example, via
opsonization).

A recent advance in this technology is the ability to construct bispecific antibodies that can bind two different epitopes. Bispecific antibodies are usually made by engineering
single-chain variable fragment (scFv) domains that are specific for different epitopes and fusing them to the free termini of mAb heavy-chain or light-chain sequences. Because
two different epitopes are targeted on a pathogen, bispecific
antibodies should be more effective antimicrobials than are
monoclonal antibodies.
C. Kendal Stover and colleagues at MedImmune, LLC,
in Gaithersburg, Maryland (Fig. 1), have constructed
novel bispecific antibodies that target the dangerous,
multiantibiotic-resistant pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
a major cause of lung and burn infections. The chimeric antibody, called BiS4αPa (or MEDI3902), is shown in Figure 2.

The mechanisms that cause persistence in the face of
bactericidal antibiotics are varied. The laboratory of Kim
Lewis recently published evidence that stochastic depletion of ATP in Staphylococcus aureus cells underlies persister formation. In Gram negative bacteria so-called
toxin-antitoxin modules play a role. One example involves
the hipA and hipB genes in uropathogenic E. coli. HipA is
the toxin part of a toxin-antitoxin module (see eTopic 10.4)

levels allows cells to grow normally. However, because
HipB antitoxin is less stable than HipA, a portion of HipA
can become active if antitoxin synthesis lags. As it is freed
of antitoxin, HipA will phosphorylate and inactivate some
EF-Tu molecules, thereby slowing translation (Chapter 8
explains the role of EF-Tu in translation). Active HipA

translation, but in a way that activates synthesis of (p)

protease called Lon protease to degrade a series of ten or

How might dormancy explain antibiotic tolerance? If
persisters are dormant and have little or no cell wall synthesis, translation, or topoisomerase activity, then even if bactericidal antibiotics can bind to their targets, target function
cannot be corrupted. Tolerance, then, provides antibiotic
resistance at the price of not growing. An antibiotic can kill

all susceptible bacteria in an infection, but the remaining
persister cells serve as a source of population regrowth (and
reinfection) once the antibiotic is removed.

The Future of Drug Discovery

The pervasive nature of bacterial resistance to current antibiotics has led many to declare that we are in the “postantibiotic era.” But is humankind really doomed to a future in
which antibiotics will no longer work? The hope is that the
prudent use of current antibiotics and innovative strategies
for finding new ones, such as the approach described in the
Current Research Highlight, will allow us to continue to
effectively control evolving bacterial pathogens.
How do you find new antibiotics? Certainly, the classic
approach—in which microbes, plants, and even animals
collected from around the world are screened for their
abilities to make new antibiotics—is still valid and remains
a fruitful source of new potential drugs. Even previously
unculturable bacteria have been screened for new antibiotics, as described in Special Topic 4.1.
The antibiotic platensimycin, made by Streptomyces platensis is a recent example in which old brute-force screening
of natural products led to a new antibiotic. The screening
method, although laborious, was novel. Merck scientists
screened 250,000 natural product extracts for an ability to
specifically inhibit bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis. Fatty
acid biosynthesis is an attractive target for antibiotic development because the process and proteins involved are different from those of eukaryotes. The strategy specifically
targeted the protein FabF because it is an essential component of fatty acid synthesis and is conserved among key
pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus.
Scientists engineered a strain of S. aureus to contain a
gene expressing an antisense RNA to fabF mRNA. When the
antisense RNA was induced, it bound to fabF mRNA and
prevented efficient translation. As a result, the level of FabF
protein in the cell decreased. The strain could still grow but
would be exquisitely sensitive to any compound that targeted
the remaining FabF protein. Fewer molecules of FabF present
per cell means that fewer molecules of an active ingredient
in a natural product are needed to stop fatty acid synthesis.
Thus, zones of inhibition on an agar plate will be wider than
they would be if cells produced normal amounts of FabF. This
novel screening method led to the discovery of platensimycin.
Platensimycin binds FabF and exhibits bacteriostatic,
broad-spectrum activity, acting on Gram-positive and
Gram-negative bacteria. It is only the third entirely new
antibiotic developed in the last four decades (daptomycin
and linezolid, an oxazolidinone, are the other two). The
novel chemical structure of platensimycin and its unique

mode of action provide a great opportunity to develop a
new class of critically needed antibiotics—a class that selectively targets fatty acid biosynthesis. However, as of this
writing, the antibiotic has not won FDA approval for use.
More information on fatty acid biosynthesis and inhibitors
can be found in Chapter 15.
Another recent success story paired brute-force screening with combinatorial chemistry to identify a novel antibiotic. Almost 30% of Earth’s humans (2 billion people)
harbor latent tuberculosis infections (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). What makes the situation even more desperate is
that of the 9 million new TB cases each year, 500,000 are
multidrug-resistant (MDR). Unfortunately, the antibiotics
for this pathogen have not changed for 40 years—until now.
To find new anti-tuberculosis agents, a team led by Belgian scientist Koen Adries screened 70,000 compounds for
antimicrobial effects on Mycobacterium smegmatis, a fastgrowing relative of M. tuberculosis. One compound that
significantly affected growth was chemically modified to
increase its efficacy. After exhaustive clinical trials, the new
drug, now called bedaquiline, was approved by the FDA in
2013 to treat MDR-TB. The antibiotic selectively targets
the organism’s energy-generating ATP synthase—a novel
mode of action—and starves the pathogen of energy. The
hope is that this new antibiotic can finally stem the rising
tide of TB. Tempering that hope, however, is the knowledge that bedaquiline-resistant mutants of M. tuberculosis
have already been isolated in the laboratory.
Newer strategies of drug discovery have centered on
genome sequence analysis and associated genetic techniques
to identify potential bacterial molecular targets. Once a target
is identified, clever screening techniques are used to find natural antibiotics, and molecular modeling is used to synthetically design potential inhibitor molecules. High-throughput
biochemical screens of large collections of synthetic chemicals have also been attempted. Although many promising
lead drugs have been identified, unfortunately only a rare
few have proved therapeutically useful. Examples of metagenomic and peptidogenomic approaches to drug discovery are
described in eTopic 15.4 and Special Topic 15.1, respectively.
So now what? The functions of genes that constitute poten-

tial new drug targets fall into three broad categories: those
required only for growth of bacteria in laboratory media
(in vitro–expressed genes), those required only for bacterial infection (virulence genes or in vivo–induced genes; the
latter are discussed in eTopic 25.2), and those required for
bacterial growth both in vitro and in vivo (essential housekeeping genes). The second and third categories clearly
constitute new potential drug targets, but there is also a
subcategory of in vitro–expressed genes that could be drug
targets. These are conditionally essential genes needed

CHAPTER 27

only under some in vitro conditions (for instance, minimal
defi ned medium) and some in vivo conditions.
A recent example showing that conditionally essential genes might be useful as drug targets was reported by
Marvin Whiteley at the University of Texas at Austin. His
group studies Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a potentially lethal
lung pathogen that plagues cystic fibrosis patients. This
bacterium readily grows in the sputum of these patients,
so the scientists wondered which bacterial genes might
be essential for growth in this substance. Using a massive
pool of Tn5 transposon insertions, Whiteley’s group discovered that insertion mutants defective in vitamin production grew poorly, if at all, in CF sputum. CF sputum must
have a vitamin deficit that forces the microbe to synthesize
those cofactors. The inference is that Pseudomonas enzymes
required for vitamin synthesis are rational targets for small
inhibitors of molecules. Such inhibitors would limit growth
of Pseudomonas in vivo but have no effect on growth in
the nutrient media typically used to identify new antibiotics
and determine MIC values.
Virulence genes and proteins of pathogens hold great
promise as targets for new drugs because these genes, too, are
required for in vivo growth. However, these proteins are also
conditionally essential, so inhibitors fail to inhibit growth
in vitro. Virulence proteins that can be potential drug targets are easy to find by measuring loss of virulence when the
gene is missing (for instance, the gene encoding the tip of a
type III secretion system), but how do you screen for specific
inhibitors of these proteins? New high-throughput screening platforms that measure in vivo growth need to be developed to find chemical inhibitors of virulence. Currently, it is
easier to make monoclonal antibodies that target virulence
proteins than it is to design and find chemical inhibitors.
Monoclonal antibodies are now being tested as pathogenspecific antimicrobials (see Special Topic 27.1).
Other intriguing ideas may lead to novel antimicrobial
therapies. One involves using photosensitive chemicals that
can penetrate the microorganism and generate toxic reactive
oxygen species (such as superoxide) when exposed to specific
wavelengths of visible light (obviously good only for topical
use). Another clever approach is to interfere with quorumsensing mechanisms of pathogens (see eTopic 27.3). Finally,
the promise and flexibility of synthetic-biology approaches
discussed in Chapter 12 could revolutionize the process of
antibiotic discovery and production.

Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance include modifying
the antibiotic, destroying the antibiotic, altering the target
to reduce affinity, and pumping the antibiotic out of the
cell. Multidrug resistance efflux pumps use promiscuous binding sites to bind antibiotics of diverse structure.
Antibiotic resistance can arise spontaneously through
mutation, can be inherited by gene exchange mechanisms, or can arise de novo through gene duplication
and mutational reengineering.
Indiscriminate use of antibiotics has significantly contributed to the rise in antibiotic resistance.
Measures to counter antibiotic resistance include
synthetically altering the antibiotic, using combination
antibiotic therapy, and adding a chemical decoy.
Persister cells in a population have stopped actively growing, making them tolerant to bactericidal antibiotics.
The quest to discover novel antibiotics includes
designing candidate antimicrobial compounds to
interact with and inhibit the active site of a known microbial enzyme, and screening previously unculturable
microbes for new antibiotics.
Potential targets for rational antimicrobial drug
design include proteins expressed only in vivo or proteins
expressed both in vivo and in vitro.

Antiviral Agents

A father pleading with a physician to give his child antibiotics when the infant is suffering with a cold is an alltoo-common dilemma faced by the general practitioner,
but there is nothing of substance the physician can do. The
common cold is caused by the rhinovirus, and no antibiotic designed for bacteria can touch it. Why are there so
few antiviral agents in the clinician’s arsenal? The reason
is that applying the principle of selective toxicity is much
harder to achieve for viruses than it is for bacteria. Viruses
routinely usurp host cell functions to make copies of themselves. Thus, a drug that hurts the virus is likely to also
harm the patient. Nevertheless, there are several useful
antiviral agents for which selective viral targets have been
found and exploited. Some of these agents are listed in
Table 27.3. Select examples are discussed in this section.
All of the molecular mechanisms of viruses presented in
Chapter 11 are studied as potential drug targets.

Antiviral Agents That Prevent
Virus Uncoating or Release

Membrane-coated viruses are vulnerable at two stages:
when the virus is invading the host cell and after viral propagation, when the progeny viruses release from the host
cell. The flu virus presents a good example of both.

Case History: Antiviral Treatment
of Infant Influenza

A 9-month-old infant arrived at the Johns Hopkins Hospital
with an acute onset of fever, cough, regurgitation from his gastrostomy feeding tube, and dehydration. This illness followed
a series of chronic problems, including bronchiolitis (infection and inflammation of the bronchioles) caused by respiratory syncytial virus, and neonatal group B streptococcal sepsis.
(Neonatal sepsis is often caused by Lancefield group B Streptococcus agalactiae; Lancefield group classification is described
in Chapter 28.) Physical exam revealed fever, a severe cough
resulting in respiratory distress, a rapid heart rate, and moderate dehydration. Nasopharyngeal aspirate was positive for
influenza A antigen. The patient was treated with oseltamivir when influenza was diagnosed. He gradually improved
and was discharged home 4 days after admission.
In 2003, an unusually severe form of influenza (H3N2)
spread across the United States. Most states reported a

higher-than-normal number of influenza-related deaths
of children and young adults. Several factors, however,
helped keep the outbreak from becoming an epidemic of
larger proportions. First, the administration of flu vaccine afforded the population what is called herd immunity (discussed in Section 24.6). Herd immunity occurs
when only a portion of the population is immunized.
The vaccinated individuals will not become infected and
so cannot spread the disease to others. At the very least,
this slows the progression of infection throughout the
population.

Note:

It is impossible to immunize all humans against any given
disease. However, it is estimated that immunizing about 80% of a
population for influenza can halt an epidemic by cutting off transmission. Unfortunately, this level of immunization is rarely achieved.

The second factor that prevented an influenza pandemic
was the availability of antiviral agents that can limit the
disease course. As a result of studying the molecular biology of influenza, scientists discovered two selective targets. Influenza virus (200 nm) is encased in a membrane
envelope donned when the virion buds from an infected
cell. As described in Section 11.2, the envelope contains
the viral proteins neuraminidase (NA) and hemagglutinin
(HA). Spikes of hemagglutinin bind to sialic acid receptors
on the host cell and trigger receptor-mediated endocytosis. The virus ends up inside the resulting endosome. After

the endosome is formed, proton pumps in the membrane
acidify endosomal contents. The drop in pH changes the
structure of hemagglutinin on the viral membrane so that
it can now bind to receptors on the endocytic membrane.
The result is fusion of the two membranes and release of
the virion into the cytoplasm.
For hemagglutinin structure to change, the interior of
the enveloped virion must also be acidified. Acidification
is mediated by a membrane channel formed by the virusencoded M2 protein. The drug amantadine (Fig. 27.27A)
is a specific inhibitor of the influenza M2 protein that prevents M2 channel formation, which, in turn, prevents viral
uncoating. Unfortunately, amantadine-resistant strains
of influenza have developed, in part because of the widespread use of amantadine by Chinese poultry farmers. As a
result, the drug is no longer recommended as a treatment
for influenza.
The second target of the influenza virus is the envelope
protein neuraminidase. The newer antiflu drugs, such as
zanamivir (Relenza) and oseltamivir (Tamiflu), are neuraminidase inhibitors that act against types A and B influenza strains (Fig. 27.27B and C). Neuraminidase on the
viral envelope allows virus particles to leave the cell in
which they were made. The enzyme cleaves any sialic acid
on the cell surface that may have bound to the hemagglutinin on the virus. Unencumbered, the virus can leave the
cell surface and infect another cell. Neuraminidase inhibitors prevent sialic acid cleavage, causing the virus particles
to aggregate at the cell surface. Surface aggregation reduces
the number of virus particles released. The contributions of
different NA and HA genes to the severity of influenza are
discussed in eTopic 27.4.
The neuraminidase inhibitors, when used within 48
hours of disease onset, decrease shedding and reduce the
duration of influenza symptoms by approximately one
day. However, flu symptoms generally last only 3–10 days.
While this does not sound like a substantial benefit, shortening the course of the flu in the elderly can minimize
damage to the lungs, which in turn reduces the chance of

developing life-threatening secondary bacterial infections
such as pneumonia and bronchitis.

Antiviral DNA Synthesis Inhibitors

Most antiviral agents work by inhibiting viral DNA synthesis. These drugs chemically resemble normal DNA nucleosides, molecules containing deoxyribose and analogs of
adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine. Viral enzymes then
add phosphate groups to these deoxynucleoside analogs to
form deoxynucleotide analogs. The deoxynucleotide analogs are then inserted into the growing viral DNA strand
in place of a normal nucleotide. Once inserted, however,
new nucleotides cannot attach to the nucleotide analogs,
and DNA synthesis stops. These DNA chain–terminating
analogs (Fig. 27.28) are selectively toxic because viral

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

polymerases are more prone to incorporate nucleotide analogs into their nucleic acid than are the more selective host
cell polymerases. Antiviral DNA synthesis inhibitors work
on DNA viruses or retroviruses, but not on viruses such as
influenza, with its RNA genome.

Antiretroviral Therapy

Retroviruses are RNA viruses that use viral reverse transcriptase to make DNA and then use viral integrase to
insert that DNA into the eukaryotic host cell genome (see
Chapter 11). The integrated provirus can then be activated
to make retroviral RNA. The retroviral RNA travels to the
cytoplasm and directs synthesis of more virus particles.
One of the most devastating retroviruses is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) (see Section 11.3).

Case History: Treatment of HIV

A married couple came to the community clinic for prenatal care. He was 20 years old. She was 19 and reportedly
2 months pregnant with her first child. She denied intravenous (IV) drug use or a history of other sexual partners and
had no history of sexually transmitted disease; however, a
routine prenatal HIV antibody screen was reported as positive for HIV-1. Careful questioning of the patient and her
husband elicited from him a history of IV drug use 5 years
earlier. An HIV antibody screen for him was also positive.
The laboratory results indicated that the wife might not
yet require therapy (she had a low viral load—that is, less
than 1,000 copies per milliliter of blood—and a high CD4
T-cell count), but since she was pregnant, a short course of
antiretroviral therapy (AZT) would be helpful in preventing transmission of the virus to her child. The husband had
an HIV viral load of 10,000 copies per milliliter and was
started on combination antiretroviral therapy, including a
protease inhibitor.
Being diagnosed with HIV is no longer a death sentence.
Advances in antiretroviral therapy (ART) over the past
10 years have transformed HIV into a manageable chronic
condition. At least half, if not most, of the HIV-positive
people in the United States now live long enough to die
from diseases of aging, such as heart attacks or strokes.
Because it is such a treatable infection, the CDC even recommends that everyone be tested for HIV. The reason for
this recommendation is that many people do not know they
are infected, but treating an asymptomatic, HIV-positive
person reduces the risk of sexually transmitting the virus.
Antiretroviral therapy can also prevent transplacental transmission from an HIV-positive pregnant woman to her

fetus, as in our case history. The drugs described next are
important components of effective treatment.
Nucleoside, nucleotide, and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. As an RNA retrovirus, HIV uses a

reverse transcriptase to make DNA that then integrates into
host nuclear DNA (discussed in Section 11.3). The antiretroviral drug zidovudine (abbreviated ZDV or AZT), which
was used in the case history, is a nucleoside analog recognized by reverse transcriptase. Once incorporated into a
replicating HIV DNA molecule, the DNA chain–terminating property (lack of a 3´ hydroxyl group) of AZT prevents
further DNA synthesis. Nucleoside inhibitors must undergo
three successive phosphorylation steps inside the cell to
become an active trinucleotide form of the drug. Nucleotide inhibitors are essentially monophosphorylated analogs
that require only two phosphorylation steps for activation.
In the case history described, AZT therapy was used
to prevent transplacental transmission of the virus from
mother to fetus. Because HIV transmission from the
mother to the neonate can also occur at delivery or by
breast-feeding, treatment of the mother and the child post
delivery is important for preventing transmission.
In addition to nucleoside inhibitors, there are also nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. For example,
the drug delavirdine binds directly to reverse transcriptase
and allosterically inactivates the enzyme.
Protease inhibitors. To make optimal use of its limited pro-

virus DNA sequence, HIV generates long, nonfunctional
polypeptide chains that are proteolytically cleaved into the
actual proteins and enzymes used to replicate and produce
new virions. For example, the gag and pol genes reside
next to each other in the HIV genome and are transcribed
as a single mRNA molecule (see Section 11.3). The Gag
and Pol open reading frames overlap but are offset by one
base. This mRNA produces two polyproteins, called Gag
and Gag-Pol, the latter being the result of a shift in reading frames that takes place during translation. Once made,
both polyproteins are cleaved by HIV protease. The Gag
protein is proteolytically cleaved to make different capsid
components (p17, p24, and p15, which is further cleaved to
make nucleocapsid protein p7) (Fig. 27.29A). Gag-Pol is
cleaved to make reverse transcriptase and integrase.
Protease inhibitors such as Viracept and Lopinavir
belong to a powerful class of drugs that block the HIV
protease (Fig. 27.29B). When the protease is inactivated,
the polyproteins remain uncleaved and the virus cannot
mature, even though new virus particles are made. Because
immature HIV particles cannot infect other cells, progress
of the disease stalls. Note that protease inhibitors do not
cure AIDS; they can only decrease the number of infectious copies of HIV.

Antiviral therapy with protease inhibitors is recommended for patients with symptoms of AIDS and for asymptomatic patients with HIV viral loads above 30,000 copies
per milliliter of blood. Treatment should be considered even
for patients with viral loads as low as 5,000 copies per milliliter, as for the husband in the case history presented earlier.
Entry inhibitors. Another way to stop HIV is to prevent the

virus from infecting cells in the first place. Drugs called entry
inhibitors do just that: They stop entry. There are two types
of entry inhibitors. CCR5 inhibitors block virus envelope
protein gp120 (also known as SU) from binding to host surface protein CCR5, a coreceptor that, together with CD4, is
needed for virus binding (see Chapter 11 and Figure 11.24
for details). As a result of CCR5 inhibition, the virus never
attaches. Fusion inhibitors, in contrast, do not prevent initial binding, but prevent HIV membranes from fusing with
T-cell membranes and thereby halt viral entry. Imagine trying to enter a room through a door. CCR5 inhibitors are like
removing the doorknob from the door so there is nothing
to grab. Fusion inhibitors, however, are like gluing the door
shut. You can grab the knob but still cannot open the door.
Treatment regimens. Because HIV can mutate rapidly and

become resistant to single-drug therapies (see Section 11.3),

■

ANTIMICROBIAL THERAPY

treatment today involves administering combinations of
three or more antiretroviral drugs. This therapeutic strategy
is called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
Most current HAART regimens include three drugs—usually two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, plus a
protease inhibitor, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitor, or an integrase inhibitor. Integrase inhibitors, fi rst
approved in the United States in 2007, block the enzyme
needed to insert viral DNA into the host genome.
You might wonder why HIV cannot be eliminated from
an infected person if the available antiretroviral drugs are
so effective. In 2011, Timothy Schaker at the University
of Minnesota, Twin Cities, examined patients undergoing ART who had undetectable blood levels of HIV. His
group found evidence that the virus in these individuals
still remained trapped in lymphatic tissues that were poorly
penetrated by the drugs. So, even though ART can lower
HIV to undetectable levels in blood, tissue pockets of HIV
remain, able to reestablish infection if ART is stopped. New
strategies designed to more effectively force drugs into tissues might be the cure we have long awaited.
Remarkably, “cures” of HIV have recently been accomplished through early and aggressive therapy. In 2013, a
newborn baby in rural Mississippi was treated aggressively
with antiretroviral drugs starting about 30 hours after
birth—something that was not usually done (unfortunately, the HIV virus has since been found in this baby).
Then, in that same year, it was revealed that a group of 14
adults treated within 4–10 weeks of infection, but whose
treatment had been inadvertently interrupted for 3 years,
did not relapse while off the drugs. The “cured” patients
still had traces of HIV in their blood, but these levels were
easily kept in check by their immune systems.
HIV treatment as prevention. AIDS can be a devastating

disease. Fortunately, we have effective antivirals that can
prevent HIV replication and AIDS. Could treating at-risk
populations with antivirals before exposure be effective
at preventing infection? This strategy is known as preexposure prophylaxis. In fact, the FDA has approved the
daily use of an HIV medicine, Truvada (tenofovir/emtricitabine), by healthy but high-risk people hoping to lower
their risk of infection by a sexual partner. Both drugs are
nucleoside analogs of adenosine and cytosine, respectively,
and are reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Although this is an
approved strategy, it is controversial even among physicians.
Some fear the drug will encourage risky behavior.

Fewer antiviral agents than antibacterial agents are
available because it is harder to identify viral targets that
provide selective toxicity.
Preventing viral attachment to, or release from, host
cells is a mechanism of action for antiviral agents, such
as amantadine and zanamivir, used to treat influenza
virus.
Inhibiting DNA synthesis is the mode of action for
most antiviral agents, although they work only for DNA
viruses and retroviruses.
HIV treatments include reverse transcriptase inhibitors that prevent the synthesis of DNA, protease
inhibitors that prevent the maturation of viral polyproteins into active forms, and entry inhibitors that
either prevent HIV from binding to host membranes
or inhibit fusion of the HIV envelop to the host cell
membrane.
Future antiviral agents may target host proteins needed
by the virus to replicate. To be useful, such drugs must
exhibit concentration-dependent selective toxicity against
viral replication rather than host function.

Antifungal Agents

Fungal infections are much more difficult to treat than bacterial infections, in part because fungal physiology is more
similar to that of humans than bacterial physiology is. The
other reason is that fungi have an efficient drug detoxification system that modifies and inactivates many antibiotics.
Thus, to have a fungistatic effect, repeated applications of
antifungal agents are necessary to keep the level of unmodified drug above MIC levels.

A 37-year-old male presented to the emergency department of
a Florida hospital with persistent fever, malaise, and a painful right-arm mass. He denied trauma to the arm. White
blood cell count was elevated at 27,000/μl, and chest X-ray
revealed a left-lung infiltrate. Bronchoscopy revealed granulomatous inflammation containing a single yeastlike mass.
Incision and drainage were performed on the arm mass, and
cultures were obtained. Serum cryptococcal antigen tests were
negative, as were tests for Bartonella henselae and Toxoplasma. Cultures from the right arm grew out a fungal form
similar to that identified from the bronchoscopy specimens.

Superficial mycoses (fungal infections) such as athlete’s foot,
and systemic mycoses such as blastomycosis, require very
different treatments. Imidazole-containing drugs (clotrimazole, miconazole) are often used topically in creams for
superficial mycoses (Fig. 27.31A). Others, such as itraconazole, are administered orally. Superficial mycoses include

infections of moist skin and mucous membranes (for example, vaginal yeast infections). The imidazole-containing
drugs appear to disrupt the fungal membrane by inhibiting
sterol synthesis. Lamisil (a terbinafine compound) is a different class of agent that selectively inhibits ergosterol synthesis by fungi. Humans do not make ergosterol nor use it
in their cell membranes. Lamisil is currently a popular antifungal agent used to treat superficial mycoses.
More chronic dermatophytic infections typically require
another antifungal agent, called griseofulvin, produced by
a Penicillium species (Fig. 27.31B). Griseofulvin disrupts
the mitotic spindle and derails cell division (called metaphase arrest). This action does not kill the fungus, but as
the hair, skin, or nails grow and are replaced, the fungus
is shed.
Vaginal yeast infections caused by Candida are often
treated with nystatin, a polyene antifungal agent synthesized by Streptomyces that forms membrane pores

(Fig. 27.31C). The name “nystatin” came about because
two of the people who discovered it worked for the laboratory of the New York State Public Health Department
(now the Wadsworth Center).
The serious, sometimes fatal, consequences of systemic mycoses require more aggressive therapy. The
drugs used in these instances include amphotericin B
(produced by Streptomyces; see Fig. 27.31D) and f luconazole. Amphotericin B binds to the sterols in fungal membranes and destroys membrane integrity. It has
a high affinity for ergosterol, which is prevalent in fungal but not mammalian membranes. Fluconazole, on the
other hand, inhibits the synthesis of ergosterol. Thus,
fungal cells grown in the presence of f luconazole make
defective membranes. Typically, curing systemic fungal
infections requires long-term treatment to prevent disease relapse. Table 27.4 lists a number of other commonly used antifungal agents.

Concluding Thoughts
Antibiotics have greatly improved the health and wellbeing of humans and animals around the globe. Millions

Phaeohyphomycosis

of people live today because antimicrobial drugs cured
infectious diseases that we’ve dreaded for centuries.
Unfortunately, by the late twentieth century, a sense of
complacency about infections and antibiotics was pervasive among citizens of developed countries. This complacency led to the irresponsible use of antibiotics, and
now a crisis of antibiotic resistance looms. We may even
be entering a postantibiotic era. Despite government
and industry throwing considerable amounts of money
and human effort at the problem, very few new, clinically useful antibiotics have been discovered over the past
four decades. And when one is found, pathogens keep
developing resistance. Nevertheless, hope remains. New
approaches to antimicrobial discovery are continually
being conceived and tested. With any luck, one or more
of the strategies will pay off, keeping us one step ahead of
the microbes.

What fascinates you about intestinal
microbiota?
I’m amazed that we can finally study the
“black box” of intestinal microbiota in
such detail. We’ve learned that intestinal microbiota affect so many facets of
our lives, such as gastrointestinal disease, obesity, diabetes, mental illnesses,
and even healthy brain function of
infants. I’m also fascinated by how gut microbiota builds in an
individual. Environmental surroundings, birth method, mother’s microbiota (even during pregnancy)—all affect the infant’s
microbiota. I am most fascinated that severe Clostridioides difficile infections can be cured simply by fecal transplants from
healthy donors.

nfections have killed more people than all of Earth’s
wars combined. Today the spread of disease is controlled in large part by worldwide surveillance agencies that can detect outbreaks quickly, before major
epidemics develop. These agencies rely on smaller
clinical microbiology laboratories scattered throughout the world that help clinicians diagnose infectious
diseases. Here in Chapter 28, we discuss the principles
of clinical microbiology and epidemiology that are used
to identify, treat, and contain outbreaks, and explain
how profiling our microbiota can predict diseases.

IBS, for instance, is currently diagnosed in broad subgroups
based on clinical symptoms (diarrhea, chronic constipation, or
a mix). Patients within subgroups, however, harbor very different microbiota. So, profiling patient microbiota can lead to
more specific diagnoses. Profiling microbiota can also indicate
how a patient might respond to treatments such as anti–tumor
necrosis factor. Fecal bacteriotherapy might then convert a
nonresponder profile into responder. Finally, monitoring the
profile of a recovered patient could signal a coming relapse.
Preventive medication could shorten the period to remission.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

On January 12, 2010, the small country of Haiti on the
Caribbean island of Hispaniola was violently shaken by
a magnitude 7.0 earthquake. Over 100,000 people died,
thousands of buildings collapsed, and the already fragile
sanitation system was severely crippled. Almost immediately, volunteers from around the world poured in to help
rescue the living, recover the dead, and rebuild what little infrastructure remained. Then, in October, a cholera
epidemic struck. Over the next 5 years, 700,000 cases of
severe diarrhea (see Chapter 25) ravaged the populace, and
more than 9,000 died. Where did it come from? Haiti had
never experienced cholera before.
Extensive epidemiological studies utilizing wholegenome sequencing strategies eventually traced the Haitian strain of Vibrio cholerae halfway around the world
to a September 2010 cholera outbreak in Nepal. How did
this faraway strain make it to Haiti so fast? Unwittingly,
the United Nations sent troops infected with the organism
from Nepal to Haiti to assist in the recovery. The Nepalese
troops set up camp and used a nearby river for sanitation.
The river became contaminated with V. cholerae and carried the pathogen through the town of Mirebalais, the site
of the first reported cholera case. From there, the infection
spread.
Such compelling stories underscore the integral roles
that clinical microbiology and epidemiology play in health
care. The Haitian cholera epidemic and the Current
Research Highlight demonstrate how modern methods of
DNA analysis have improved our ability to track disease
around the world and even predict impending disease in an
individual. In Chapter 28 we begin by explaining the basic
strategies and methodologies used to diagnose infectious
diseases, and we end with a discussion of how epidemiologists identify and track emerging pathogens. Our goal is
not to catalog every infectious disease, but to demonstrate
general principles and problem-solving approaches.

28.1

Clinical Microbiology:
Specimen Collection
and Handling

As in any good detective mystery, the first step in investigating an infectious disease is to identify the most likely
suspects. We can accomplish this, in part, by observing the
disease symptoms in a patient and knowing which organisms typically produce those symptoms. It also helps if
the physician is aware of a similar disease outbreak under
way in the community. Beyond these clues, the etiological
agent must be identified through biochemical, molecular,
serological, or antigen detection strategies.

Why Take the Time to Identify
an Infectious Agent?

This is the first question many students ask when contemplating the effort and expense required to identify the genus
and species of an organism causing an infection. Why not
simply treat the patient with an antibiotic and be done with
it? While this approach sounds appealing, there are several
compelling reasons for identifying an infectious agent.
Antibiotic resistance. As discussed in Chapter 27, antibi-

otic resistance is an increasingly serious global problem.
Characterizing a microbe’s antibiotic resistance profi le is
part of any microbial identification process. Understanding which antibiotics are effective in treating an infectious
agent will help the physician avoid prescribing an inappropriate drug. Furthermore, knowing which drugs are ineffective enables health organizations to track the spread of
antibiotic-resistant strains. For example, before 1970, most
strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were susceptible to penicillin. Today, most strains are resistant not only to penicillin, but also to many other antibiotics. Remember, too,
that viral pathogens are not susceptible to antibiotics, so
knowing that a patient has a viral disease can prevent the
inappropriate use of antibiotics.
Pathogen-specific disease complications. Many diseases

have serious complications that are common to a given
organism or strain of organism. For example, children
whose sore throats are caused by certain strains of Streptococcus pyogenes can develop serious complications affecting
the heart and kidney long after the infection has resolved.
These complications are the immunological consequence
of bacterial and host antigen cross-reactivity; they are
called sequelae (singular, sequela) because they occur after
the infection itself is over. Life-threatening sequelae, such
as rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis caused by
certain strains of S. pyogenes, produce severe damage to the
heart and kidney, respectively. Knowing early on that S.
pyogenes has caused a child’s sore throat allows the physician to prescribe antibiotics that will quickly eradicate the
infection and prevent the development of sequelae.

Note:

Penicillin or a penicillin-like antibiotic is the usual treatment for Streptococcus pyogenes infection. Contrary to what
you might expect, S. pyogenes has not developed any penicillinresistant strains. It is not understood why.

Tracking the spread of a disease. Consider a situation
in which ten infants scattered throughout a city develop
bloody diarrhea. The clinical laboratory identifies the same
strain of Shigella sonnei, a Gram-negative bacillus, as the
cause in each case.

CHAPTER 28

Immunological or nucleic acid amplification tests can be
used to type a strain (discussed later). Finding the same
strain in all cases suggests that they probably originated
from the same source. Shigellosis is transferred from person to person by what is called the fecal-oral route. Carriers
of Shigella will shed this organism in their feces. Inadequate hand washing after defecation will leave bacteria on
the hands, which can then transfer the pathogen to foods
or utensils, or to another person by touching.
Public health officials, armed with the knowledge that
all the infants have the same strain of Shigella, then question the parents and learn that all of the children attend the
same day-care center. By testing the other children and the
workers in that center, officials can stop the infection from
spreading. This investigative process is called epidemiology (covered in Section 28.3).

CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY

Identifying pathogens present at body sites containing
normal microbiota is more challenging. A stool or fecal sample, for instance, is normally teeming with microbiota. These
specimens are typically plated onto selective media—for
example, MacConkey, Hektoen, or colistin–naladixic acid
(CNA) agar (described in the next section)—to eliminate or
decrease the number of normal microbiota that might contaminate the specimen. The following techniques are used to
collect specimens from nonsterile body sites:
Swabs. Throat swabs (Fig. 28.1B), for example, should be
placed in specialized liquid nutrient transport medium.
Sputum. Deep lung secretions expectorated for oral collection (Fig. 28.1C).
Stool samples. Cup or rectal swab; for identifying diarrhea-causing microbes.
Abscesses. Needle aspirations.

Specimen Collection and Processing

To diagnose an infectious disease, physicians must collect,
and the laboratory must process, a wide variety of clinical
specimens. The types of specimens range from simple cotton swabs of sore throats to urine and fecal samples. Here
we describe how these samples should be collected. Note
that, upon receiving and processing these specimens, the
clinical microbiologist must wear latex gloves and use a
laminar flow biosafety hood (see Fig. 5.28) as protection
against potential infectious agents.
Some body sites should not contain any microorganisms
when collected from a healthy individual. These include
blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid from the
space that lines the outside of the lungs, synovial fluid
from joints, and peritoneal fluid from the abdominal cavity. Because these sites are normally sterile, specimens can
be plated onto nonselective agar media as well as selective
media. Nonselective media, such as blood or chocolate
agars, can be used because any organism found in these
specimens is considered significant.
The following techniques are used to collect specimens
from sterile body sites:
Cerebrospinal fluid. Lumbar punctures (spinal taps;
Fig. 28.1A); testing for meningitis.
Blood samples. Generally taken by syringe from two
body sites and placed in liquid media for aerobic and
anaerobic culture. The same organism isolated from
blood samples taken from the two sites is considered
the likely etiological agent.
Pleural, synovial, and peritoneal fluid. Samples are
aspirated by syringe. The fluid can be viewed microscopically for inflammatory cells and cultured on agar
aerobically and anaerobically.

Urine samples. Midstream clean catch (will contain
some microflora from urethra) or collected from catheters placed in the bladder (should be sterile); testing
for urinary tract infections.

Note:

The minimum standard for diagnosing a urinary tract
infection used to be a finding of greater than 100,000 organisms
per milliliter of urine. As noted in the text, this is no longer the case.

Urine is a special case. Urine in the bladder of a healthy
individual was once considered sterile. Studies now show
that the bladder does, indeed, have normal microbiota (at
low numbers) although their role in human health is unclear.
Why didn’t we see them before? Most members are either
anaerobic or difficult to grow on the standard media used to
culture urine. Even though we now know that the bladder
contains normal microbiota, for practical purposes clinical
microbiologists still consider urine to be “sterile,” or nearly
so. The symptoms of urinary tract infections (which include
increased frequency, painful urination, and suprapubic or
flank pain) occur only when significant numbers of easily
grown, aerobic or facultative microbes are present.
Urine is sampled in several ways. When collected from a
catheterized patient, urine should contain few, if any, aerobically culturable organisms. Catheterization involves passing
thin, sterile tubing through the urethra and directly into the
bladder (Fig. 28.1D). (Catheterization is used primarily to
assist urination by immobilized patients, but it also provides
a convenient way to collect urine for bacteriological examination.) Unfortunately, the simple process of inserting the catheter through the nonsterile urethra can sometimes introduce
organisms into the bladder and precipitate an infection. Also,
when culturing urine from a catheterized patient, the urine
should be collected from a port in the catheter, never from
the collection bag. Urine may sit for hours in the collection

bag, so organisms initially present at insignificant numbers
have time to replicate to high numbers even if the patient
does not have a urinary tract infection (UTI).
When a catheter is not in place, urine is most commonly
collected by what is called the midstream clean-catch technique, which is performed by the patient. In this procedure,
the external genitals are first cleaned with a sterile wipe containing an antiseptic. The patient then partially urinates
to wash as many organisms as possible out of the urethra
and then collects 5–15 milliliters of the midstream urine
in a sterile cup. This urine sample will usually not be sterile, because of urethral contamination, but the number of
bacteria will be low. The clinical laboratory determines how
many organisms per milliliter are present in the midstream
catch and tells the physician whether an infection is present.
Finding more than 1,000 organisms of a single species per
milliliter of urine from a midstream clean catch is now considered indicative of an infection in a symptomatic patient.

Once a specimen from any body site has been properly
collected, it must be transported to the clinical laboratory
under conditions that will not undermine the viability of
the pathogen. Then, after arriving in the lab, the sample
must be processed quickly using protocols that ensure
growth of likely pathogens.

Case History: Abdominal Abscess

A 4-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital for evaluation and treatment of persistent pain in the rectal area. His
problem had begun about a week earlier with ill-defined
pain in the same area. He had a white blood cell count of
24,900 (normal 4,000–11,000) with 87% neutrophils (normal 60%). An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan
revealed an abscess adjacent to his rectum. A needle aspiration drained 20 ml of yellowish, foul-smelling fluid from
the abscess. Aerobic cultures of this specimen plated on blood

The problem in this instance is related to specimen collection and processing. Internal abscesses
located near the gastrointestinal tract are often
anaerobic infections, in this case caused by the
Gram-negative rod Bacteroides fragilis, a strict
anaerobe (Fig. 28.2A). Section 5.5 discusses
anaerobes. Intestinal microbes, the majority of
which are anaerobic, can sometimes escape the
intestine if the organ is damaged in some way.
The specimen in this instance should have been
collected under anaerobic conditions by aspiration into a nitrogen-filled tube prior to transport
to the clinical laboratory. Alternatively, a swab of
the abscess material can be inserted into a special
transport tube that has a built-in oxygen elimination system (Fig. 28.2B). Because the specimen was collected aerobically, many anaerobic
microbes were probably killed by the oxygen.
Nevertheless, B. fragilis has a stress response
system that permits survival of this anaerobe for
1 or 2 days in oxygen, so some of the bacteria
may have survived transport. The laboratory still
had a chance to find the organism, which raises
the second problem in the case. After receiving
the specimen, the lab cultured it only under aerobic conditions. The laboratory should have also
incubated a series of plates anaerobically (see Section 5.5, Fig. 5.20). This case, therefore, illustrates the importance of both proper specimen
collection and proper processing.

Biosafety Containment Procedures

Medical and laboratory personnel are exposed to extremely
dangerous pathogens on a daily basis. When working with
dangerous pathogens, clinical microbiologists must protect
themselves from accidental infection and at the same time
be certain the pathogen does not escape from the lab.

Case History: Fatal Meningitis

On July 15, an Alabama microbiologist was taken to the
emergency room with acute onset of generalized malaise,
fever, and diffuse myalgias. She was given a prescription for
oral antibiotics and released. On July 16, she became tachycardic and hypotensive and returned to the hospital. She died
3 hours later. Blood cultures were positive for Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C. Three days before the onset of symptoms,
the microbiologist had prepared a Gram stain from the blood
culture of a patient subsequently shown to have meningococcal

disease; she had also handled agar plates containing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures from the same patient. Co-workers reported that fluids were aspirated from blood culture
bottles at the open laboratory bench. No biosafety cabinets,
eye protection, or masks were used for this procedure. Testing
at CDC indicated that the isolates from both patients were
indistinguishable. The laboratory at the hospital infrequently
processed isolates of N. meningitidis and had not processed
another meningococcal isolate during the previous 4 years.
The microbiologist in this case did not take appropriate
measures to protect herself and ended up with a laboratory-acquired infection leading to meningitis. The CDC
has published a series of regulations designed to protect
workers at risk of infection by human pathogens. Infectious agents are ranked by the severity of disease and ease
of transmission. The more severe the disease or the more

easily it is transmitted, the higher the risk category. On the
basis of this ranking, four levels of biological containment
are employed (Table 28.1).
Biosafety level 1 organisms have little to no pathogenic
potential and require the lowest level of containment.
Standard sterile techniques and laboratory practices are
sufficient.
Biosafety level 2 agents have greater pathogenic potential, but vaccines and/or therapeutic treatments (for

example, antibiotics) are readily available. The pathogen in
the case described here, Neisseria meningitidis, is in this
risk group. These agents require more rigorous containment procedures, such as limiting laboratory access when
experiments are in progress and using biological laminar
flow cabinets if aerosolization is possible.
Biosafety level 3 pathogens produce a serious or lethal
human disease. Vaccines or therapeutic agents may be available. To safely handle these organisms, level 2 procedures are

for obvious reasons. As of this writing, there are 11 BSL4
laboratories operating in the United States.
It is important to note that most clinical microbiology laboratories are equipped to handle BSL2 organisms.
Patient samples suspected to contain a level 3, or higher,
agent are sent directly to regional reference laboratories or
to the CDC for analysis.

Thought Questions

28.1 Two blood cultures, one from each arm, were taken
from a patient with high fever. One culture grew Staphylococcus epidermidis, but the other blood culture was negative (no
organisms grew out). Is the patient suffering from septicemia
caused by S. epidermidis?
28.2 A 30-year-old woman with abdominal pain went to

her physician. After the examination, the physician asked the
patient to collect a midstream urine sample that would be sent
to the lab across town for analysis. The woman complied and
handed the collection cup to the nurse. The nurse placed the
cup on a table at the nurses’ station. Three hours later, a courier service picked up the specimen and transported it to the
laboratory. The next day, the report came back: “greater than
200,000 CFUs/ml; multiple colony types; sample unsuitable
for analysis.” Why was this determination made?

supplemented with a lab design ensuring that ventilation air
flows only into the room and that exhaust air vents directly
to the outside, thus producing negative pressure. Negative
pressure will keep any organism that may aerosolize from
escaping into hallways. In addition, access to the lab is strictly
regulated and includes double-door air locks at the entrance.
By law, extremely dangerous pathogens such as the
Ebola virus, for which there is no treatment or vaccine, may be studied only at a biosafety level 4 containment facility. Practices here dictate that lab personnel wear
positive-pressure lab suits connected to a separate air supply
(Fig. 28.3). The positive pressure ensures that if the suit is
penetrated, organisms will be blown away from the breach
and not sucked into the suit.
As reasonable as these regulations may seem, they were
not always in effect. Prior to 1970, scientists had an almost
cavalier approach toward handling pathogens. For instance,
culture material was routinely transferred from one vessel
to another by mouth pipetting (essentially using a glass or

Identifying a pathogen enables clinicians to prescribe
appropriate antibiotics, anticipate possible sequelae,
and track the spread of the disease.
Specimen collection is a critical first step in the process
of identifying a pathogen.
Common specimens include blood, pus, urine, sputum, throat swabs, stool, and cerebrospinal fluid.
Specimens from sites containing normal microbiota
must be handled differently from specimens taken from
normally sterile body sites.
A specimen from an abscess or other infection that
might contain anaerobes must be collected under
anaerobic conditions.
Various levels of protective measures are used in
handling potentially infectious biological materials.
Biosafety level 1 agents are generally not pathogenic
and require the lowest level of containment.
Biosafety level 2 agents are pathogenic but not typically transmitted via the respiratory tract. Laminar flow
hoods are required.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Biosafety level 3 agents are virulent and transmitted
by the respiratory route. They require laboratories with
special ventilation and air-lock doors.
Biosafety level 4 agents are highly virulent and require
the use of positive-pressure suits.

28.2

Approaches to Pathogen
Identification

Now that we have collected a sample, how do we identify
the pathogen, and do it quickly? Pathogens can be identified on the basis of a variety of observations, including the
patient’s symptoms, the presence of organisms in stained
clinical specimens, biochemical clues, and serology (the
presence in a patient’s serum of antibodies reactive against
a specific microbe).

Conventional Approaches
Staining procedures. Some specimens, such as CSF and
sputum, can be directly stained with the Gram stain procedure (described in Section 2.3) or the acid-fast stain.
Knowing that an organism is Gram-positive, Gram-negative, or acid-fast guides which additional tests the clinical
microbiologist must run. The case that follows illustrates
how the acid-fast stain is critical for presumptively identifying mycobacteria.

Case History: Tuberculosis

by the acid-fast stain, a technique first described in 1882
(called the Ziehl-Neelsen stain) that is used to find the
tubercle bacillus in a patient’s sputum. The acid-fast stain
enables a technician to visualize bacteria such as Mycobacterium species that are not stained by the Gram stain. Mycobacteria have a very waxy outer coat composed of mycolic
acid that resists penetration by most dyes—an obstacle the
acid-fast stain was designed to overcome.
The original Ziehl-Neelsen acid-fast stain used phenol
and heat to drive carbolfuchsin (a red dye) into mycobacterial
cells on glass slides. Destaining with an acidic alcohol solution removes the stain from all cell types except mycobacteria. The slide is subsequently counterstained with methylene
blue, after which the mycobacteria will be seen as curved,
red rods (called acid-fast bacilli), while everything else will
appear blue (Fig. 28.4A). A more modern version of the
acid-fast stain uses the fluorochrome auramine O to stain
the mycolic acid. This dye also resists removal by an acidic
alcohol wash, so the mycobacteria will fluoresce bright yellow when observed under a fluorescence microscope.
Although the acid-fast stain is very useful, it detects
organisms in the sputum of tuberculosis patients only
about 60% of the time; and even if they are found, confirmatory tests are needed for a definitive diagnosis. Growthdependent identification of M. tuberculosis typically starts
with inoculating the sputum sample to a blue-green Löwenstein-Jensen medium (selective for mycobacteria) and
waiting several weeks for the organism to grow before additional tests can be done (Fig. 28.4B). However, while the
organism grows, a rapid, nucleic acid amplification test
(NAAT) can be used to quickly detect even small amounts
of the organism, even in AFB-negative sputum samples.
The NAAT tests are described later in this section.

CHAPTER 28
Growth and biochemical testing. Once the Gram reac-

tion of an organism is known, the conventional laboratory approach used to identify bacterial pathogens requires
understanding basic microbial physiology and how diverse
it is. Thousands of bacterial species are capable of causing
disease, but no two species have the same biochemical “signature.” The clinical microbiologist can look for reactions,
or combinations of reactions, that are unique to a given
species, as in the following case history.

Case History: Medical Detective Work

A 38-year-old woman with no significant previous medical
history came to the emergency room complaining of a mild
sore throat persisting for 3 days. Her symptoms included
arthralgia (joint pain), myalgia (muscle pain), and a lowgrade fever. The day before coming to the ER she had had a
severe headache with neck stiffness, nausea, and vomiting. She
was not taking any medications, had no known drug allergies, and did not smoke. She lived with her husband and two
children, all of whom were well. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
was collected from a spinal tap. The CSF appeared cloudy
(it should be clear) and contained 871 white blood cells per
microliter (normal is 0–10/μl), the glucose level was 1 mg/dl
(normal is 50–80), and the total protein level was 417 mg/dl
(normal is less than 45). Gram stain of a CSF smear revealed
Gram-negative rods. The CSF sample was sent to the diagnostic laboratory for microbial identification.
As discussed in Thought Question 26.9, low glucose and
elevated protein levels in CSF are indicators of bacterial (not
viral) infection. The increase in white blood cells revealed
that the woman’s immune system was trying to fight the
disease. The presence of Gram-negative rods in the CSF
smear confirmed a diagnosis of bacterial meningitis, since
CSF should be sterile. Now it was up to the clinical laboratory to determine the etiological agent.
Algorithms to identify bacteria. Over the years, clinical

microbiologists have developed algorithms (step-by-step
problem-solving procedures) that expose the most likely
cause of a given infectious disease. For instance, only a limited number of microbes are known to cause meningitis.
The microbiologist poses a series of binary yes/no questions about the clinical specimen in the form of biochemical or serological tests. Typical questions in this case might
include: Is an organism seen in the CSF of a patient with
symptoms of meningitis? Is the organism Gram-positive or
Gram-negative? Does it stain acid-fast? Answers to a fi rst
round of questions will then dictate the next series of tests
to be used.
Because speed is of the essence in deciding how to
treat the patient, a series of tests is not always carried out

sequentially. To save time, a slew of tests are carried out
simultaneously, but the results are interpreted sequentially
using the algorithm. In our case history, for instance, consider the most common causes of bacterial meningitis: Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus
influenzae, and Escherichia coli.
The CSF sample was Gram-stained by a microbiologist and simultaneously plated onto three media: chocolate agar, blood agar, and Hektoen agar. Chocolate agar is
an extremely rich medium that looks brown, owing to the
presence of heat-lysed red blood cells (Fig. 28.5A and B).
Because it is so nutrient-rich, all four organisms will grow
on chocolate agar. However, nutritionally fastidious organisms such as N. meningitidis and H. influenzae will not
grow well, if at all, on ordinary blood agar, because these
bacteria cannot lyse red blood cells and release required
nutrients. Less fastidious organisms, such as S. pneumoniae
and E. coli, will grow on blood agar, but of these two, only
E. coli can grow on Hektoen agar (Fig. 28.5C–E), which
is a selective and differential medium for enteric Gramnegative rods. Hektoen is selective because bile salts and
dyes inhibit the growth of Gram-positives. It is differential
because the medium reveals organisms that ferment lactose
or sucrose and produce hydrogen sulfide. Differential and
selective media are described in Section 4.3.
In our case history, the Gram stain of the CSF revealed
Gram-negative rods, which ruled out N. meningitidis
(a Gram-negative diplococcus) and S. pneumoniae (a Grampositive diplococcus). The organism in CSF did grow
on blood agar, which eliminated H. influenzae (a Gramnegative, nonenteric rod) as a candidate. It also grew on Hektoen, where it produced orange, lactose-fermenting colonies.
Thus, the organism was a Gram-negative, enteric rod, and
likely E. coli. Additional biochemical tests confirming the
identity of the organism had to be carried out, but this simple
example shows how simultaneous tests can be interpreted.
Identifying Gram-negative bacteria. The Gram-negative

bacterium in this case was subjected to a battery of 36 biochemical tests in an automated microbial identification
instrument (Fig. 28.6A). Most clinical laboratories in the
United States and Europe now use these automated identification systems. The organism is inoculated into the wells
of a prepared microtiter dish in which each well contains
materials that test an organism’s ability to ferment different
carbon sources or make different metabolic end products
(Fig. 28.6B and C). By monitoring the growth or change
in color produced in different wells, the instrument can
quickly identify the pathogen’s metabolic profi le, sometimes within 5–6 hours. For each bacterial species, the system software “knows” the probability that a given reaction
will be positive or negative, and from that information the
program can identify the pathogen.

sulfide precipitate visible in the center of the colonies.

Gram-negative bacilli found in other, nonenteric, phylogenetic families. For instance, one possibility in the preceding case history is that the Gram-negative bacillus seen
in CSF smears would not grow on blood agar or on the
other selective media, but would grow as small, glistening
colonies on chocolate agar. This result would implicate the
Gram-negative rod Haemophilus influenzae.
Meningitis caused by H. influenzae was a major problem
prior to 1988, before the introduction of a vaccine containing H. influenzae type b capsular material. Growth of
H. influenzae requires hemin (X factor) and NAD (V factor), so confirming the identity of H. influenzae involves
growing the organism on agar medium containing hemin
and NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide). This can
be done by placing small filter paper disks containing these
compounds on a nutrient agar surface (not blood agar)
that has been covered with the organism. H. influenzae
will grow only around a strip containing both X and V
factors. Alternatively, X and V factors can be incorporated
into Mueller-Hinton agar, as shown in Figure 28.9A. The

organism grows on chocolate medium because the lysed
red blood cells release these factors. Although XV growth
phenotype is still used for identification, fluorescent antibody staining is more specific (discussed shortly).
A completely different identification scheme would have
been used in the preceding meningitis case if the laboratory
had discovered the organism to be a Gram-negative diplococcus (rather than a Gram-negative rod). A Gram-negative diplococcus would suggest Neisseria meningitidis. N.
gonorrhoeae is also possible, but it is less likely because the
gonococcus lacks the protective capsule that meningococci
use to survive in the bloodstream. Without this capsule, N.
gonorrhoeae is not as resistant to serum complement and
cannot disseminate to the meninges.
The first test to determine whether the organism
is a species of Neisseria is the cytochrome oxidase test
(Fig. 28.9B). Cytochrome oxidase is the terminal oxidoreductase for O2 (discussed in Chapter 14). In this test, a few
drops of the colorless reagent N, N, N´, N´-tetramethylp-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride are applied to the

suspect colonies. The reaction, which takes place only if
the organism possesses both cytochrome oxidase and cytochrome c, turns the p-phenylenediamine reagent (and the
colony) a deep purple/black. While many bacteria possess
cytochrome oxidase, Neisseria is one of only a few genera that also contain cytochrome c in their membranes.
Oxidase-positive organisms use cytochrome oxidase to
oxidize cytochrome c, which then oxidizes p-phenylenediamine. Other oxidase-positive bacteria include Pseudomonas, Haemophilus, Bordetella, Brucella, and Campylobacter
species—all of them Gram-negative rods. None of the
Enterobacteriaceae, however, are oxidase-positive, because
they lack cytochrome c.
An oxidase-positive, Gram-negative diplococcus is very
likely a member of Neisseria. Differentiation between species of Neisseria is based on their ability to grow on certain
carbohydrates, or it can be determined using immunofluorescent antibody staining tests that test for the presence of
different capsule antigens in N. meningitidis.
Identifying Gram-positive pyogenic cocci. Recall from

Section 26.2 the case of the woman with necrotizing fasciitis. How did the laboratory determine that the etiological agent was Streptococcus pyogenes? A sample algorithm, or
flowchart (Fig. 28.10), shows how this is done. The physician sends a cotton swab containing a sample from a lesion
to the clinical laboratory. The laboratory technician streaks
the material onto several media: (1) blood agar (which will
grow both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms);
(2) blood agar containing the inhibitors colistin and naladixic acid (called a CNA plate, this agar will grow only

Gram-positives); and (3) MacConkey agar (which will grow
only Gram-negative organisms; see Section 4.3). The suspect organism in this case grows on the CNA and blood
plates. Because it grows in the presence of the Gram-negative inhibitory compounds in CNA, one would immediately
suspect the organism to be Gram-positive—an assumption
borne out by the Gram stain.

Note:

Though the skin is normally populated by many different
microorganisms, samples from an infected lesion are overwhelmingly populated by the etiological agent. The pathogen predominates because it outgrows normal microbiota. Using selective
media to isolate the infectious agent will further simplify diagnosis
by decreasing the growth of any normal microbiota that may still
be present.

The algorithm tells the laboratory technician that since
the organism is a Gram-positive coccus, the next step is
to test for catalase production. Catalase, which converts
hydrogen peroxide (H 2O2) to O2 and H 2O, clearly distinguishes staphylococci from streptococci (remember, Gram
stain morphology alone is insufficiently reliable to make
that distinction). The catalase test is performed by mixing a
colony with a drop of H 2O2 on a glass slide. Effusive bubbling due to the release of oxygen indicates catalase activity
(see Fig. 28.10). Staphylococci are catalase-positive; streptococci are catalase-negative. Note that many other organisms possess catalase activity, including the Gram-negative
rod E. coli. According to the algorithm, however, E. coli
would not be considered, because it does not grow on
CNA agar and is not Gram-positive.

Note:

When performing a catalase test from colonies grown
on blood agar, be sure not to transfer any of the agar, since red
blood cells also contain catalase.

Having established that the organism is catalase-negative, the technician examines the blood plate for evidence of
hemolysis. Three types of colonies are possible: nonhemolytic, alpha-hemolytic, and beta-hemolytic. Nonhemolytic
streptococci do not produce any lytic zone. Alpha-hemolytic strains produce large amounts of hydrogen peroxide
that oxidize the heme iron within intact red blood cells
to generate a green product. As a result, alpha-hemolytic
streptococci produce a green zone around their colonies

the organism is resistant to the agent.

called alpha hemolysis—even though the red blood cells
remain intact. (For example, Streptococcus mutans, a cause
of dental caries and subacute bacterial endocarditis, is
alpha-hemolytic.) Still other streptococci produce a completely clear zone of true hemolysis surrounding their
colony. This is called beta hemolysis. Red blood cells are
hemolyzed completely by exported enzymes, called hemolysins, that lyse red-cell membranes. The flowchart in Figure 28.10 indicates that the organism from the case history
was beta-hemolytic.
The final relevant test in this flowchart involves susceptibility to the antibiotic bacitracin, which identifies the most
pathogenic group of beta-hemolytic streptococci. The betahemolytic streptococci are subdivided into many different
groups, known as Lancefield groups, based on differences
in the composition of a carbohydrate antigen anchored
to peptidoglycan. These cell wall differences are distinguished from each other immunologically and divide the

■ Rebecca Lancefield. In 1918, Dr. Lancefield
joined the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York
City, where she studied the hemolytic streptococci, known then as
Streptococcus haemolyticus. She was the first to use serum precipitation methods to classify S. haemolyticus into groups according to
differences in cell wall carbohydrate antigens. The basic technique
is still used today and in her honor is known as the Lancefield classification scheme.

streptococci into Lancefield groups A–U. Rebecca Lancefield (Fig. 28.11), for whom the classification scheme is
named, was the first to use immunoprecipitation to group
the streptococci (immunoprecipitation is described in Section 24.2 and eAppendix 3). The vast majority of streptococcal diseases are caused by group A beta-hemolytic
streptococci (also called GAS), defined as the species Streptococcus pyogenes.
Unfortunately, the Lancefield classification procedure is
somewhat time-consuming and not readily amenable as a
rapid identification method. However, the group A betahemolytic streptococci are uniformly susceptible to the
antibiotic bacitracin. Thus, a simple antibiotic disk susceptibility test can be used to indicate GAS (that is, S. pyogenes). But beware—many bacteria are bacitracin sensitive,
so, like the catalase test, to be useful for identification the
bacitracin test must be used in conjunction with an algorithm. The technician must follow the appropriate algorithm before assigning importance to this or any other test
result. It is irrelevant, for instance, if an alpha-hemolytic
organism is bacitracin susceptible. Some of these may exist,
but they are not associated with disease. The organism in
our case of necrotizing fasciitis, however, was beta-hemolytic, so bacitracin susceptibility indicated that the organism was S. pyogenes.
The other tests named in Figure 28.10 are equally
important for identifying Gram-positive infectious agents.

For example, Streptococcus pneumoniae is an important
cause of pneumonia. Like S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae is a
catalase-negative, Gram-positive coccus; but unlike S. pyogenes, it is alpha-hemolytic. Optochin susceptibility is a
property closely associated with S. pneumoniae, while other
alpha-hemolytic strains of streptococci are resistant to this
compound. Thus, an optochin susceptibility disk test is a
useful tool for identifying S. pneumoniae.
Coagulase catalyzes a key reaction used to distinguish
the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus, which causes boils and
bone infections, from other staphylococci, such as the normal skin species Staphylococcus epidermidis. To conduct a
coagulase test, a tube of plasma is inoculated with the suspect organism. If the organism is S. aureus, it will secrete
the enzyme coagulase. Coagulase will convert fibrinogen
to fibrin and produce a clotted, or coagulated, tube of
plasma. Coagulase-negative staphylococci can still be medically important, however. Staphylococcus saprophiticus, for
instance, is an important cause of urinary tract infections.
It can be distinguished from S. epidermidis by resistance to
novobiocin.

Thought Question

28.3 Use Figure 28.10 to identify the organism from the
following case: A sample was taken from a boil located on
the arm of a 62-year-old man. Bacteriological examination
revealed the presence of Gram-positive cocci that were also
catalase-positive, coagulase-positive, and novobiocin resistant.

Rapid Techniques for
Pathogen Identification

Conventional, petri plate–dependent methods used to
identify pathogens take a minimum of 3 days to complete
and may take several weeks, depending on the pathogen.
Brucella species, for instance, can take 14–21 days to grow
in blood culture bottles. The delay may be annoying for
the physician, but agonizing for the patient awaiting a cure.
Today, technologies that offer more rapid identifications,
sometimes within minutes, have been introduced into the
clinical laboratory.
Nucleic acid–based pathogen detection. Most diagnostic
laboratories today use rapid DNA-based methods in addition to conventional petri dish microbiology. The DNAbased methods take mere hours to detect and identify
bacteria and viruses. DNA/RNA detection methods are
especially useful for viruses, which otherwise require elaborate electron microscopy to view morphology, or serology
to detect an increased presence of antiviral antibodies. The
problem with serology is that by the time these antibodies

1148

become detectable in blood, the patient is usually already
recovering from the disease.
The polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is the most

widely used molecular method in the diagnostic toolbox (see Section 7.6, Fig. 7.28). DNA primers that bind
to unique genes in a pathogen’s genome can be used to
specifically amplify DNA or RNA present in a clinical or
environmental specimen thought to harbor a pathogen.
Successful amplification is visualized as an appropriately
sized DNA fragment (amplicon) in agarose gels following
electrophoresis.
Why is PCR needed to detect the presence of these
nucleic acids? Without the PCR amplification steps, clinical
samples usually provide too little nucleic acid from infecting microorganisms to be detected. For example, sputum
samples containing Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the cause
of tuberculosis, yield minuscule amounts of bacterial DNA.
Amplifying M. tuberculosis nucleic acid by PCR, however,
will turn one copy of DNA into billions of copies.
PCR is very quick. Preparing a clinical specimen for PCR
by extracting the DNA or RNA usually takes less than an
hour. PCR itself is completed in 1–2 hours. Detection of
the PCR-amplified DNA by DNA gel electrophoresis takes
an additional 1–2 hours. So, what might take 2–3 days (or
sometimes weeks) using biochemical algorithms may take
less than a day using PCR.
The table in eTopic 28.2 lists several instances in which
DNA detection tests are useful. A specific example presented in Figure 28.12 illustrates the use of PCR to

botulinum. C. botulinum cells are typed by which toxin genes a
strain possesses, not on the basis of surface antigens. Isolates can
be typed in a single PCR reaction that includes primer pairs specific
for each of the four major toxin genes: types A, B, E, and F. Because
multiple products are sought in a single reaction, this is called multiplex PCR. Each lane in the agarose gel was loaded with multiplex
products from different isolates of C. botulinum and subjected
to electrophoresis. The slower-moving fragments (toward top of
gel) are larger than those moving farther down the gel toward the
positive pole. Lane 1, DNA size markers; lane 2, type A (cntA); lane

type different strains of the anaerobic pathogen Clostridium botulinum, the cause of food-borne botulism. These
organisms are not typed serologically, as is the case for
Streptococcus pneumoniae. C. botulinum is divided into different types based on the neurotoxin genes they possess. In
this example, multiplex PCR was used to simultaneously
search for these toxin genes. Multiplex PCR uses multiple
sets of primers, one pair for each gene, combined in a single tube with a specimen. Care must be taken to be sure
that the primers chosen make different-sized products, do
not interfere with each other, and do not produce artifactual (biologically false) products that can confuse interpretation. Multiplex PCR can help identify sets of specific
genes present in a single species or can screen for the presence of multiple pathogens in a clinical sample. In the latter, primer sets are designed to amplify genes unique to
each pathogen.
PCR can quickly identify microbial DNA in clinical
samples, but what about RNA? Many RNA viruses cause
disease. Can molecular tools identify them?

Case History: West Nile Virus

A 55-year-old man was admitted to a local hospital complaining of headache, high fever, and neck stiffness. The man
appeared confused and disoriented. He also complained of
muscle weakness. History indicated he had received several
mosquito bites approximately 2 weeks previously. A blood specimen was sent to the laboratory. The report the following day
indicated that the patient was suffering from West Nile virus.
West Nile virus (WNV) is an RNA-containing virus that
infects primarily birds and culicine mosquitoes (a group of
mosquitoes that can transmit human diseases). Humans
and horses serve only as incidental, dead-end hosts for
the virus. Replication of virus in this bird-mosquito-bird
cycle begins when adult mosquitoes emerge in early spring
and continues until fall. Among humans, the incidence
of disease peaks in late summer and early fall. Birds provide an efficient means of geographic spread of the virus.
As a result, over the past two decades the virus has spread
throughout much of the United States.
Isolating a disease-causing virus is extremely challenging. Most laboratories are not equipped for the special
tissue culture techniques required to grow viruses. Consequently, many viral infections, including human West
Nile virus infections, have been diagnosed by measuring
the antibody response of the patient (described shortly).
For instance, the presence of West Nile virus–specific IgM
in cerebrospinal fluid is a good indicator of current WNV
infection, but it is indirect and inconclusive. Real-time
PCR is a molecular test that can quickly reveal the presence
of the viral RNA.

The trick is in the method used to quantify the result. In
one method, a third, fluorescent oligonucleotide (called the
probe) is added to the PCR reaction (see Fig. 12.13A). The
probe contains a fluorescent dye at the 3´ end and a chemical dye at the 5´ end that quenches (absorbs) energy emitted
from the fluorescent dye. As long as the two chemicals are
kept in close proximity by the intact probe, no light is emitted. The probe is designed to anneal to a sequence between
the binding sites of the two other primers (modifications on
the ends of the probe prevent it from being used as a primer).
So, in a successful amplification, Taq polymerase will synthesize DNA from the two outside primers and degrade the
probe oligonucleotide as it passes through that area. This
cleavage separates the dye from the quencher, and the dye
begins to fluoresce. The greater the amount of cDNA there
was to begin with, the fewer cycles it takes to register a fluorescence increase over background (Fig. 28.14).

background fluorescence threshold. The cycle at which fluorescence rises above background is the cycle threshold (CT). In patient

therefore the level of fluorescent dye released remained below
background. After cycle 10, fluorescence increased logarithmically:

will increase over background (that is, the fewer cycles will be
needed to see the increase over background). The slope eventually
decreases because the fluorescent probe has become limiting.

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Rapid, next-generation DNA sequencing. In 2014, a

14-year-old boy with severe combined immunodeficiency
(SCID) was in a medically induced coma at a Wisconsin hospital. His brain had swollen with fluid as a result of encephalitis, but its cause was unknown. The usual diagnostic tests
and antibiotic treatments did not provide answers or relief.
In a last attempt to fi nd the infection’s cause, the boy’s physicians called Joseph DeRisi and Charles Chiu at UC San
Francisco, who are renowned for their use of next-generation DNA sequencing (see Chapter 7) to identify pathogens.
The scientists used this technology to perform an unbiased
metagenomic analysis of all the DNA contained in the boy’s
cerebrospinal fluid. After sequencing 3 million DNA fragments, the answer was apparent. There, staring out from
among the sequences of the boy’s genome, were DNA
sequences of the spirochete Leptospira santarosai, an easily
treatable organism. After being given intravenous high-dose
penicillin for 7 days, the boy eventually recovered.
Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease. The organism
is excreted in the urine of infected animals, usually into
nearby bodies of freshwater. The child probably contracted
the disease during a trip to Puerto Rico, where he swam in
freshwater. Why didn’t immunological tests initially identify antibodies to Leptospira? The immunocompromised
state of the boy likely prevented him from making detectible
amounts of anti-leptospiral antibodies. DNA, then, was the
only way. This metagenomic strategy to detect pathogens is
not widely used yet because of its complexity, but someday
it could be used to diagnose any infection.
Rapid DNA sequencing by mass spectrometry. The future

of nucleic acid–based diagnostic microbiology includes a
new technology that combines PCR with mass spectrometry (MS). PCR can amplify DNA directly from clinical samples using primers that target conserved bacterial sequences
(for instance, 16S rRNA genes). MS then analyzes the
molecular weight of the “amplicon” and sequences it. As
described for proteins in eAppendix 3, sequencing involves
electron spray ionization to progressively shorten the PCR
product one base at a time, and mass spectrometry to calculate the weight of each new, shortened fragment. The
difference in molecular weights between the initial DNA
fragment and the progressively shortened ones is used to
determine the identity of each base removed and, thus, the
sequence of the fragment. Because culturing would no longer be needed, this technology could eventually replace the
time-honored petri dish.
Programmable RNA sensors. Zika virus is a fast-emerging,

insect-borne pathogen that causes serious developmental
defects, such as microcephaly, in infected fetal brains (see
the Current Research Highlight in Chapter 26, and Section
28.4). The virus has been declared a public health emergency

that requires a quick and easy diagnostic test. Keith Pardee
(University of Toronto) and Alexander Green (Arizona State
University), shown in Figure 28.15A, with a team of scientists led by James Collins, have designed just such a test
using synthetic-biology approaches (see Section 12.5). It is a
paper-based test that takes only 3 hours to complete.
The basis of the test is illustrated in Figure 28.15B. The
first step is to generate a “trigger” RNA that will ultimately
flip a riboswitch sensor. To make sufficient amounts of the
trigger RNA, a trigger primer that binds to a unique Zika
virus RNA sequence is added to a serum sample extract
that contains Zika virus RNA. Reverse polymerase uses
the primer to generate a cDNA template. To amplify copies of trigger RNA, a second, hybrid primer is added whose
3´ end binds to the Zika virus cDNA and whose 5´ end
includes a T7 phage promoter sequence. T7 RNA polymerase is then added to the new double-stranded cDNA to
generate multiple copies of Zika trigger RNA. This amplification process is called isothermic DNA amplification
because thermocycling, as used by PCR, is not needed.
The trigger RNA copies derived from the original infecting
virus will trip the riboswitch in the next phase of the test.
The synthetically constructed riboswitch sensor is shown
in Figure 28.15C. The RNA switch contains a hairpin
structure that blocks translation of downstream LacZ RNA
by sequestering the LacZ ribosome-binding site (RBS) and
start codon. This is called a “toehold” switch. When Zika
trigger RNA (made previously) is added, the trigger RNA
binds to the toehold switch and releases the LacZ RBS and
start codon. Translation of the mRNA produces LacZ protein that will convert a yellow substrate to a purple product (a
positive test). Once the trigger RNA is added to the switch,
the mixture is placed on paper disks containing protein synthesis components, which, after an hour, are analyzed by an
electronic reader. This rapid test product is not yet on the
market, but its development provides a glimpse of what this
technology can bring to the field of rapid diagnostics.
Serology-based pathogen detection. In

addition to
directly identifying a pathogen by culture isolation or by
PCR detection, evidence for a pathogen can be found in a
patient’s serum, as seen in the following case history.

Case History: Ebola Outbreak

On December 26, 2013, an 18-month-old West African boy in
the town of Meliandou, Guinea, fell ill with a mysterious disease of high fever, black stools, and vomiting. He died 2 days
later. By January 2014, several members of the boy’s family, as
well as staff at the nearby Guéckédou hospital, had developed
similar symptoms that included severe bloody diarrhea. All
died. Then, in February, a member of the boy’s family traveled to the capital city, Conakry, where he, too, fell ill and

died. The cause remained unknown, and no precautions were
taken. Consequently, over the next month the illness spread to
four other prefectures in Guinea, killing at least half of those
infected. In March, a World Health Organization (WHO)
laboratory at the Pasteur Institute in France finally identified the agent as the Zaire strain of Ebola virus, the most
deadly form of this filovirus. Laboratory confirmation tests
included RT-qPCR, viral antigen detection, and antibody
ELISA tests. Unfortunately, identification of the virus came
too late to stop the horrific Ebola epidemic that swept through
western Africa in 2014–15, killing thousands.
Ebola is another RNA virus, but one far more deadly
than the West Nile virus identified in the earlier case history. Pathogenesis of Ebola was discussed in Section 26.6
(Fig. 26.25). This case includes many elements of epidemiology (discussed later), all of which rely on an ability to
identify the presence of the virus. Diagnosis during this
epidemic involved three techniques. We already discussed
RT-qPCR, but what serological tests were used?

The ELISA test. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay

(ELISA) is an immunological technique that can detect
antigens or antibodies present in picogram quantities. (A
picogram is one one-thousandth of a nanogram.) One
form of ELISA detects serum antibodies. It is carried out
in a 96-well microtiter plate, which allows multiple patient
serum samples to be tested simultaneously. An antigen
from the virus (Ebola in this case) is attached (adsorbed) to
the plastic of the wells (Fig. 28.16). Albumin or powdered
milk is used to block the remaining sites on the plastic that
could result in false positives. Patient serum is then added.
Ebola-specific antibodies present in the serum will
react with the antigen attached to the microtiter plate.
The antigen-antibody complex is then reacted with rabbit antihuman IgG to which an enzyme has been attached,
or conjugated (for example, horseradish peroxidase). The
result is a chain of viral antigen connected to patient antibody connected to rabbit antibody-enzyme that links the
enzyme to the well. The chromogenic substrate for the
enzyme is added next (for example, tetramethylbenzidine).

a single patient’s serum to more precisely determine the amount of
anti-Ebola antibody, or it can be used to test samples from multiple
patients.

If enzyme-conjugated antibody has bound to human IgG
captured by the antigen in the well, the enzyme will convert the substrate to a colored product (blue for tetramethylbenzidine). Enzyme activity can be measured with
an ELISA plate reader. The amount of colored product
formed, detected as absorbance with a spectrophotometer,
will be an indication of the amount of anti-Ebola antibody
present in the patient sample.

Thought Question

28.5 Why does adding albumin or powdered milk prevent
false positives in ELISA?

Antigen capture is another ELISA technique, but in this
instance, anti-Ebola antibody, not viral antigen, is adsorbed
to the wells of a microtiter plate (Fig. 28.17). Patient serum
is then added to the wells. If the serum contains Ebola antigen, the antigen will be captured by the antibody attached
to the well. Then a second, enzyme-conjugated antibody
against the Ebola antigen is added. The more antigen there
is in the serum, the more enzyme-linked antibody will affix
to the well. Addition of the appropriate chromogenic substrate will produce a colored product that can be measured.
Antibody against Ebola, or any other viral pathogen,
may be easier to detect than viral antigen because antibodies will be present at higher levels than the virus itself. But
since there is a delay between the time when the virus is
first present in serum and when the body manages to make
antibody, a speedier diagnosis can be made by directly
detecting viral antigen.

Thought Questions

28.6 Why does finding IgM to West Nile virus indicate a
current infection? Why wouldn’t finding IgG do the same?
28.7 Specific IgG antibodies against an infectious agent can
persist for years in the bloodstream, long after the infection
resolves. How is it possible, then, that IgG antibody titers can
be used to diagnose recently acquired diseases such as infectious mononucleosis? Couldn’t the antibody be from an old
infection?

Fluorescent antibody staining. Chapter 26 presents a case

history involving an 80-year-old nursing-home resident
who contracted pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. The laboratory diagnosis was probably made
using the biochemical algorithm previously described.
However, there are over 80 serological types of S. pneumoniae, each one containing a different capsular antigen. How can the lab identify which antigenic type has
caused the infection? One way is to stain the organism
with antibodies.
Figure 28.18A illustrates the result of staining a smear
of the isolated streptococcus with fluorescently tagged antibodies directed against a specific antigenic type of capsule.
Viewed under a fluorescence microscope, the organism
is “painted” green when the right antibody binds to the
capsule. In the case of pneumonia, this knowledge probably will not help in treating the patient, but its broader
value is in determining whether a single type of organism
is the cause of an outbreak of pneumonia, which in turn is
of epidemiological value for identifying the source of the
bacterium.

On the other hand, fluorescent antibody staining techniques are critically important for rapidly identifying organisms that are difficult to grow. Infected tissues can be subjected
to direct fluorescent antibody staining. Figure 28.18B, for
example, shows a direct fluorescent antibody stain of pleural
fluid from a patient with Legionnaires’ disease.
Identifying pathogens using mass spectrometry. Mass

spectrometry (MS) was briefly described in Section 10.6
in the discussion of proteomics. This technology is now
able to identify whole bacteria in clinical labs. One such
technique is called matrix-associated laser desorption/
ionization–time-of-fl ight mass spectrometry (MALDITOF-MS). Whole bacteria or an extract is mixed with a
matrix solution and spotted on a metal plate (Fig. 28.19)
that absorbs energy from a laser and converts it to heat. The
heat ionizes proteins in the sample.
Matrix-associated laser desorption/ionization is a soft
ionization technique that leaves proteins intact but ionized.
An electrostatic field then accelerates the ionized proteins
through a vacuum tube, and their time of flight before
hitting a detector is measured. How long a protein takes
to reach the detector depends on its mass-to-charge ratio.
Large proteins with a high mass-to-charge ratio take longer
to travel than small proteins with a small mass-to-charge
ratio. The results are printed as a series of peaks. The pathogen can be identified by comparing the pattern of peaks
with those in a database of organisms (Fig. 28.20).
MALDI-TOF-MS has been incorporated into the work
flows of many diagnostic microbiology laboratories across
the world. The procedure is very fast. Once a sample is
loaded, an identification result can be delivered in approximately 15–30 seconds. In most cases of infection, a single

Other Pathogens Identified by
Conventional or Rapid Diagnostics

Space does not permit a complete listing of the methods used
to identify microbial pathogens, but Table 28.3 presents
some additional examples. In general, bacteria that are easily
cultured are grown in the laboratory, after which biochemical

tests are performed. Bacterial, viral, and fungal species that
are difficult to grow are typically identified using immunological techniques that either identify a microbial antigen
present in infected tissues or measure a rise in antibody titer.
Nucleic acid–based methodologies are also used to identify
organisms that are difficult to grow. Eukaryotic microbial
parasites such as Plasmodium species (the cause of malaria),
Giardia lamblia (which causes giardiasis, a diarrheal disease),
and Entamoeba histolytica (the cause of amebic dysentery) can
be identified via their telltale morphologies under the microscope, making biochemical tests unnecessary.

The typical POC test approved for use involves an
immunochromatographic assay. The test for Streptococcus
pneumoniae capsular antigen shown in Figure 28.21A
is one example. This particular immunochromatographic
test, called a “red colloidal gold” test, involves extracting
the relevant antigen (for example, capsule antigen) from
a clinical specimen and placing a few drops of the extract

The antibodies have red colloidal gold particles attached
to them. The antigen-antibody complexes, if present, move
by capillary action to the upper level of the strip, where
they are captured by a line of more anti-antigen antibodies embedded in the strip, forming an antibody-antigenantibody sandwich. The colloidal gold particles accumulate
and eventually produce a red test line, indicating the presence of the antigen. In contrast, rabbit antibodies that are
not bound to the antigen pass through the test line but

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

The newer nucleic acid–based tests described earlier
exhibit better sensitivity and specificity than most immunochromatographic assays, but they require more expensive instrumentation and training. In the coming years,
further evolution of POC tests may lead to new diagnostic approaches, such as panel testing that targets all possible
pathogens suspected in a specific clinical setting. The development of next-generation serology-based and/or molecularbased multiplex tests will certainly facilitate quicker diagnosis
and improved patient care. We also saw earlier how synthetic
biology may revolutionize rapid diagnostics, as exemplified
by the newly described Zika virus riboswitch test.

Direct Gram or acid-fast stains are appropriate procedures to perform on some specimens. The results guide
the direction of subsequent testing.
Knowing which patient specimens should be sterile
and which should contain normal microbiota informs
the selection of media for processing the specimen. So,
too, does understanding whether anaerobes may be
expected.
Selective media are used to prevent growth of normal
microbiota while permitting growth of others (such as
Gram-positive bacteria versus Gram-negative bacteria).
Differential media exploit the unique biochemical
properties of a pathogen to distinguish it from similarlooking nonpathogens.
Growth-dependent pathogen identification uses
numerous, simultaneously run biochemical tests. An
algorithm or a dichotomous key is applied to the
results to identify the species. Different algorithms (or
decision trees) are applied to Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria.
Pathogens can be identified with biochemical analyses (useful for bacteria), molecular techniques (for
example, PCR; useful for bacteria or viruses), and/or
immunological methods (for example, ELISA; useful
for bacteria or viruses).
Fluorescent antibody staining can rapidly identify
organisms or antigens present in tissues.
Point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests can rapidly identify the cause of an infectious disease. Therapy can be
initiated rapidly following a positive result. Sensitivity
(the ability to detect small amounts of the pathogen)
and specificity (the ability to distinguish one pathogen
from another) for any point of care test are factors used
to evaluate how accurate the test is at eliminating false
negative and false positive reactions, respectively.

Immunochromatography is the primary platform for
POC testing.
A drawback to POC tests is that simultaneous, multiple
infections may be missed.

28.3

Principles of
Epidemiology

In Section 25.1 we discussed how a new infectious disease
can be identified using a version of Koch’s postulates. But
how do scientists track the spread of a new disease, or find
and identify new variants of influenza virus that develop
thousands of miles away, and then predict when that virus
will arrive on our “doorsteps” many months in advance?
We start our discussion of epidemiology with a case in
which scientists had to trace a heinous criminal act back to
its source.

Case History: Inhalation Anthrax

On October 16, 2001, a 56-year-old African-American U.S.
Postal Service worker became ill with a low-grade fever, chills,
sore throat, headache, and malaise. These symptoms were
followed by minimal dry cough, chest heaviness, shortness of
breath, night sweats, nausea, and vomiting. On October 19,
the man arrived at a local hospital, where he presented with
a normal body temperature and normal blood pressure. He
was not in acute distress, but he had decreased breath sounds
and rhonchi (dry sounds in lungs due to congestion). No skin
lesions were observed, and he did not smoke. Total white blood
cell count was normal, but there was a left shift in the differential—that is, more polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs;
see Section 26.3). A chest X-ray showed bilateral pleural effusions (accumulation of fluids in the lung) and a small, rightlower-lobe air space opacity. Within 11 hours, blood cultures
taken upon admission grew Bacillus anthracis. Ciprofloxacin, rifampin, and clindamycin antibiotic treatments were
initiated, and the patient recovered. His job at the post office
was simply to sort mail.
From October 4 to November 2, 2001, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and various state and
local public health authorities reported 10 confirmed cases of
inhalational anthrax and 12 confirmed or suspected cases
of cutaneous anthrax in persons who worked in the District
of Columbia, Florida, New Jersey, and New York. Many of
them were postal workers. It was clear that a biological attack
was in progress.
Painstaking detective work by federal agents and epidemiology scientists proved that the strain of Bacillus anthracis

B.

Endemic, Epidemic, or Pandemic?

The terms “endemic” and “epidemic” are often used when
referring to disease outbreaks. A disease is endemic if it
is always present in a population at a low frequency. For
example, Lyme disease, caused by the spirochete Borrelia
burgdorferi, is endemic to the northeastern United States
because the organism has found a reservoir in deer and
ticks. Recall that a reservoir is an animal, bird, or insect
that harbors the infectious agent and is indigenous to a
geographic area. Humans become infected only when they
come in contact with the reservoir. Thus, the disease incidence is low but relatively constant. A disease is epidemic,
on the other hand, when larger-than-normal numbers of
individuals in a population become infected over a short
time. Epidemics arise, in part, because of rapid and direct
human-to-human transmission. Food-source epidemics,
for instance, are discussed in Chapter 16.
Figure 28.22A illustrates the difference in the frequency of cases observed between endemic and epidemic

used in the 2001 anthrax attack had the same genetic signature as a strain used by Bruce Ivins, a scientist working
at the army’s Fort Detrick biodefense laboratory. Although
his involvement was never proved, Dr. Ivins took his own
life as agents were about to arrest him.
The word “epidemiology” is derived from the Greek
meaning “that which befalls man.” In scientific parlance,
epidemiology examines the distribution and determinants of disease frequency in human populations. Put
more simply, epidemiologists determine the source of a
disease outbreak and the factors that influence how many
individuals will succumb to the disease. Epidemiological principles are also used to determine the effectiveness
of therapeutic measures and to identify new syndromes,
such as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), MERS
(Middle East respiratory syndrome), and Lyme disease.
Some of the basic concepts of epidemiology were already
covered in Chapter 26 when we discussed infection cycles.
Now we will explore how those principles are used to
track disease.
Epidemiological early-warning systems require an
extensive organization that coordinates information from
many sources. In the United States, that duty falls to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
On the world stage, it is the World Health Organization (WHO). Any disease considered highly dangerous or infectious is first reported to local public health
centers, usually within 48 hours of diagnosis. The local
centers forward that information to their state agencies,
which then report to the CDC in Atlanta. This is how
authorities in 2001 quickly recognized that an outbreak
of anthrax was under way.

disease. An endemic disease can become epidemic if the
population of the reservoir increases, allowing for more frequent human contact; or if the infectious agent evolves to
spread directly from person to person, bypassing the need
for a reservoir. This is the concern with the H5N1 avian flu
virus, which is endemic in animals and birds in Asia (see
Sections 11.2 and eTopic 26.3). A pandemic is an epidemic

that occurs over a wide geographic area, usually the world.
Pandemics may be long-lived, such as the bubonic plague
pandemic in the fourteenth century and the AIDS pandemic in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries;
or they may be short-lived, as with the 1918 flu pandemic.
When discussing a disease, epidemiologists distinguish
between the prevalence and incidence of active cases. Prevalence describes the total number of active cases of a disease
in a given location, regardless of when the case first developed. Incidence, however, refers to the number of new
cases of a disease in that location over a specified time. Incidence reflects the risk a person has of acquiring the disease.
Incidence rates can provide insight into whether efforts to
limit a disease are working. Take a city of 100,000 people.
If the incidence of new cases rises from 10 cases/100,000
population in one year to 30 cases/100,000 population the
next year, then efforts to stem the disease are failing. Prevalence, reflecting the total burden on society, could also
increase over those two years or might remain the same—
say, 500 cases/100,000—if more people are being cured or
perhaps die in that second year despite the increase in new
cases. Endemic diseases maintain relatively constant prevalence and incidence rates. Outbreaks are typically marked
by an increase in both parameters.

Finding Patient Zero

When trying to contain the spread of an epidemic, it is vital
to track down the first case of the disease (known as the
index case or patient zero) and then identify everyone who
has had contact with that individual so that they can be
treated or separated from the general population (quarantined) (Fig. 28.22B). When a new disease arises, the epidemiological search for the index case starts only after a
number of patients have been diagnosed and a new disease
syndrome declared. This is what happened with the Ebola
epidemic in 2015.
Identifying an index case within a specific community
is easier if the disease syndrome is already recognized, as
was the case with the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore. According to the
World Health Organization, a suspected case of SARS is
defined as an individual who has a fever greater than 38°C
(100.4°F), who exhibits lower respiratory tract symptoms,
and who has traveled to an area of documented disease or
has had contact with a person afflicted with SARS. The
index case in Singapore was a 23-year-old woman who had
stayed on the ninth floor of a hotel in Hong Kong while on
vacation. A physician from southern China who stayed on
the same floor of the hotel during this period is believed
to have been the source of her infection, as well as that of
the index patients who precipitated subsequent outbreaks
in Vietnam and Canada.

A. The coronavirus that causes SARS (TEM). B. Citizens of China,
including the military, donned surgical masks in 2003 to slow the
spread of SARS.

During the last week of February, the woman, who had
returned to Singapore, developed fever, headache, and a dry
cough. She was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital, Singapore, on March 1 with a low white blood cell count and
patchy consolidation in the lobes of the right lung. Tests
for the usual microbial suspects (Legionella, Chlamydia,
Mycoplasma) were negative. Electron microscopy of nasopharyngeal aspirations showed virus particles with widely
spaced club-like projections (Fig. 28.23A). At the time
of her admission to the hospital, the clinical features and
highly infectious nature of SARS were not known. Thus,
for the first 6 days of hospitalization, the patient was in a
general ward, without barrier infection control measures.
During this period, the index patient infected at least 20
other individuals, including hospital staff, nearby patients,
and visitors.
Within weeks, the WHO named the disease in China
“SARS” and issued travel alerts (discussed further in Section 28.3). These alerts allowed Singapore health officials
to rapidly identify the index patient and her contacts. As a
result, they were able to limit spread of the illness. When all
was said and done, SARS killed fewer than 1,000 victims

one of lesser concern. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA), H5N1 avian flu, and H1N1 swine flu are
considered more pressing dangers.

Identifying Disease Trends

How do epidemiologists first recognize that an epidemic is
under way, and then identify the agent and its source? Certain diseases, because of their severity and transmissibility,
are called reportable, or notifiable, diseases (Table 28.5).
Physicians are required to report instances of these diseases to a central health organization, such as the CDC
in the United States and the WHO. This reporting allows
the incidences of certain diseases within a population to
be tracked and upsurges noted. An emerging disease not
on the list of notifiable diseases can be detected as a cluster of patients with unusual symptoms or combinations of
symptoms. Such detection is possible because diseases of

unknown etiology are also reported to health authorities.
A new disease could manifest with common symptoms
(for example, the cough and fever of SARS) that cannot
be linked to a known disease agent by clinical tests. An
upsurge in cases, of either a reportable disease or an emerging disease, will set off institutional “alarms” that initiate
epidemiological efforts to determine the source and cause
of the outbreak.

John Snow (1813–1858), the
Father of Epidemiology

The first case in which the source of a disease outbreak
was methodically investigated arose in the mid-nineteenth
century. During a serious outbreak of cholera in the Soho
district of London in 1854, John Snow (Fig. 28.24A)
visited the addresses of all the diarrheal cases he learned
about. The source of the infection was unknown, but Snow
thought that if the cases clustered geographically, he might
gain a clue as to its location. Water in that part of London

1162

was pumped from separate wells located in the various
neighborhoods. Snow realized there was a close association between the density of cholera cases and a single well
located on Broad Street (Fig. 28.24B). Simply removing
the pump handle of the Broad Street well put an end to
the epidemic, proving that the well water was the source of
infection (known as the “point source,” since all infections
originated from that point).
This approach succeeded brilliantly, even though the
infectious agent that causes cholera, Vibrio cholerae, was
not recognized until 1905, over 50 years later. Identifying clusters of patients afflicted with a given disease is still
used to locate potential sources of infectious disease outbreaks. Outbreaks of disease that originate from a common
source, as in the London cholera outbreak, are called common-source outbreaks. In contrast, a propagated outbreak
involves person-to-person transmission (SARS) or transmission by insect vectors (such as West Nile virus).
Thought Questions

28.8 Methicillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic, is very useful in
treating staphylococcal infections. The emergence of methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a very
serious development because few antibiotics can kill these
strains. Imagine a large metropolitan hospital in which there
have been eight serious nosocomial infections with MRSA and
you are responsible for determining the source of infection so
that it can be eliminated. How would you accomplish this task
using common bacteriological and molecular techniques?
28.9 What are some reasons why some diseases spread

Genomic Strategies Help Identify
Nonculturable Pathogens

Microbiologists have successfully developed many strategies to identify the causes of infectious diseases. As noted
earlier, Robert Koch in the late nineteenth century devised
a set of postulates that, when followed, can identify the
agent of a new disease (discussed in Sections 1.3 and 25.1).
One important tenet of Koch’s postulates is that the suspected organism must be grown in pure culture. However,
there are bacterial diseases for which the agent cannot be
cultured. How might they be identified?

Case History: Whipple’s Disease

In April, a 50-year-old man had an abrupt onset of watery
diarrhea with a stool frequency of up to 10 times every 24 hours.
This was the latest episode in a 6-year history of illness beginning with recurring fevers, flu-like symptoms, profuse night
sweats, and painful joint swelling. The current bout of diarrhea
was associated with gripping lower abdominal pain, especially
after meals. No blood or mucus was found in the stools. Blood
and stool cultures tested negative for known infectious agents.
Serology was also negative for syphilis, brucellosis, toxoplasmosis,
and leptospirosis. The man’s weight fell rapidly from 83 to 73 kg
within 4 weeks of onset. A flexible sigmoidoscopy showed only diffuse mild erythema in the bowel. However, the appearance of
the small bowel was consistent with malabsorption, a disease in
which nutrients are poorly absorbed by the intestine. A duodenal biopsy to look for the organisms of Whipple’s disease showed
large macrophages in the lamina propria (a layer of loose connective tissue beneath the epithelium of an organ). Bacterial rods

CHAPTER 28

characteristic of Whipple’s disease were seen with electron microscopy. PCR analysis of tissue samples confirmed the diagnosis.

FREDRICKS D.N. & D.A. RELMAN. J INFECT DIS 183, 1229-1237 (2001).

First diagnosed by George Whipple in 1907, Whipple’s disease is characterized by malabsorption, weight loss, arthralgia (joint pain), fevers, and abdominal pain. Any organ
system can be affected, including the heart, lungs, skin,
joints, and central nervous system. The cause of Whipple’s
disease went undiscovered for 85 years, but the disease
was suspected to be of bacterial etiology, even though an
organism was never successfully cultured. The agent was
finally identified in 1992—not by culturing, but by blindly
amplifying 16S rDNA sequences from biopsy tissues.
All bacterial 16S rRNA genes have some sequence regions
that are highly homologous across species and other sequences
that are unique to a species. Tissues from numerous patients
diagnosed with Whipple’s disease were subjected to PCR
analysis using the common 16S rDNA primers. If a bacterial
agent was present, it was predicted that PCR should successfully amplify a DNA fragment corresponding to the agent’s
16S rRNA gene. All tissues produced such a fragment, indicating that there were bacteria in the tissues. DNA sequence analysis of these fragments indicated that the organism was similar
to actinomycetes but was unlike any of the known species.
The organism is actually a Gram-positive soil-dwelling
actinomycete that was named Tropheryma whipplei in honor
of the physician who first recognized the disease. Because
of its bacterial etiology, Whipple’s disease can be treated
with antibiotics, usually trimethoprim sulfamethoxazole
(Bactrim, Septra, Cotrim). Figure 28.25 shows an in situ
hybridization for T. whipplei RNA in a tissue biopsy.

This story reveals that Koch’s postulates (see Fig. 1.17)
must sometimes be modified when identifying the cause of
a new disease. In this instance, the organism could not be
cultured in pure form in the laboratory, but it was found, via
molecular techniques, in all instances of the disease. More
recent studies have successfully cultured T. whipplei in vitro.
The medium used was formulated on the basis of nutritional
requirements deduced from knowing the DNA sequence of
the T. whipplei genome (discussed in Section 25.7).

Molecular Approaches for
Disease Surveillance

A worldwide pandemic of pulmonary tuberculosis currently
affects over 2 billion people. Many of the Mycobacterium
tuberculosis infections are caused by multidrug-resistant
strains that are difficult, if not impossible, to kill with existing antibiotics (see Section 26.3). This problem is especially
serious among refugee populations attempting to flee wartorn countries. As a result, it is important to screen these
refugees as they enter neighboring countries with low incidences of tuberculosis. Although chest X-rays are mandatory in many cases, a positive image will be obtained only if
the disease is at a relatively advanced stage. Actively infected
individuals who have not developed the characteristic lung
tubercles seen on X-ray will not be identified.
Unfortunately, the acid-fast staining of sputum samples (discussed in Section 28.2) also fails to detect individuals at an early stage of infection. Studies have shown,
however, that PCR techniques are much more sensitive for
detecting these individuals. As time progresses, PCR surveillance strategies will be used more often to track the
worldwide ebb and flow of microbial diseases. PCR and
restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) strategies are already used for epidemiological purposes to type
(that is, determine the relatedness of) different microbial
isolates by generating a complex DNA profile that is specific for a particular strain (see Section 28.2). For example,
DNA profiles were used to link an outbreak of over 2,000
cases of salmonellosis in 2010 to a single strain of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis. The results, conducted by
a national network of public health agencies (PulseNet), led
to the recall of over a half billion eggs.

Bioterrorism

“A wide-scale bioterrorism attack would create mass panic
and overwhelm most existing state and local systems within
a few days,” said Michael T. Osterholm, director of the
Center for Infectious Disease Research & Policy at the
University of Minnesota, in October 2001. “We know this
from simulation exercises.”

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

Less than a month after the September 11 attack on the
World Trade Center, a biodefense scientist working at the
U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (Fort Detrick, Maryland) allegedly sent weaponsgrade anthrax spores through the U.S. mail (see the earlier
inhalation anthrax case history). Thankfully, only 5 persons died, and a mere 25 became ill. But even though the
efficiency of the attack was poor, the impact was enormous.
Over 10,000 people took a 2-month course of antibiotics
after possible exposure, and mail deliveries throughout the
country were affected. The simple act of opening an envelope suddenly became a risky business.
As a result of this attack and other events, the CDC and
the National Institutes of Health (NIH) assembled a list of
select agents (marked in blue in Table 28.1) that could potentially be used as bioweapons. A bioweapon is considered to be
any infectious agent or toxin that has high virulence and/or
mortality rate. Microorganisms considered bioweapons can
be used to conduct biowarfare, with the intent of inflicting
massive casualties; or bioterrorism, which may result in only
a few casualties but cause widespread psychological trauma.
Although the branding of select agents is recent, biowarfare is not new. In the Middle Ages, victims of the Black
Death (plague caused by Yersinia pestis) were flung over
castle walls using catapults. During the French and Indian
War in the eighteenth century, British field marshal Jeffrey
Amherst distributed smallpox-infected blankets to Native
Americans. The Imperial Japanese Army during World
War II experimented with infectious disease weapons using
Chinese prisoners as guinea pigs. Even the United States participated by developing weapons-grade anthrax spores after
World War II. That project was discontinued in the 1970s.

KENNETH LAMBERT/AP

A.

The 2001 anthrax attack described earlier was not the
first act of bioterrorism in the United States. The first documented act occurred in 1984, when followers of the cult
leader Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh tried to control a local
election in The Dalles, Oregon, by infecting salad bars
with Salmonella. Over 700 people became ill. Rajneesh was
given a 10-year suspended sentence, fined $400,000, and
deported.
How effective are bioweapons? The method by which a
biological agent is dispersed plays a large role in its effectiveness as a weapon. Only a few people became ill during
the 2001 anthrax attack—not only because of the epidemiological surveillance, but because anthrax is inherently
difficult to disperse. Thousands of spores must be inhaled
to contract disease, which means that effective dispersal of
the spores is critical for the use of anthrax as a weapon.
Once spores hit the ground, the threat of infection is limited. Weapons-grade spores are very finely ground so that
they stay airborne longer. But, as we saw, the letter-borne
dispersal system did not effectively generate large numbers
of victims. Nevertheless, the potential threat of weaponsgrade anthrax on the battlefield led the U.S. military in
2006 to resume vaccinating all soldiers serving in Iraq,
Afghanistan, and South Korea.
An effective bioweapon would capitalize on person-toperson transmission. In an easily transmitted disease, one
infected person could disseminate disease to scores of others within 1 or 2 days. So, in terms of generating massive
numbers of deaths, anthrax was a poor choice. The goal
of most terrorists, however, is not to kill large numbers of
people, but to terrorize them. In that regard, the anthrax
attack succeeded (Fig. 28.26A).

CHAPTER 28

The most effective bioweapon in terms of inflicting
death (biowarfare) would have a low infectious dose, be
easily transmitted between people, and be one to which a
large percentage of the population was susceptible. Smallpox fits these criteria and would be the bioweapon of choice
(Fig. 28.26B). Fortunately, however, smallpox has been
eradicated (almost) from the face of the Earth and is not
easily obtained. Two laboratories still harbor the virus—
one in the United States and one in Russia. It is believed
that the virus has been destroyed in all other laboratories.
Since smallpox is the perfect biowarfare agent, it is imperative that the last two smallpox repositories remain secure.
While the good news is that smallpox disease has been
eradicated, the bad news is that no individual born after
1970 has been vaccinated, with the exception of some military and laboratory personnel. As a result, anyone under
50 years of age is susceptible to smallpox. Even those of us
who received the smallpox vaccination over 45 years ago are
at risk, since our protective antibody titers have diminished.
A terrorist attack with smallpox would cause terrible numbers of deaths. A new, safer vaccine does exist, however, and
has been stockpiled. Were a smallpox attack to be launched,
the vaccine would be rapidly administered to limit the
spread of disease. Nevertheless, the economic and psychological impact of a smallpox epidemic would be devastating.
Research with organisms considered to be select agents
is tightly regulated. Because Yersinia pestis, for instance, is
a select agent, laboratory personnel working with it must
now possess security clearance with the Department of Justice (even though the organism itself can be handled under
biosafety level 2 conditions; see Table 28.1). The laboratory must also register with the CDC to legally possess this
pathogen, and access to the lab and the organism must be
tightly controlled.
Much has improved since Michael Osterholm offered his
dire assessment of a wide-scale bioterrorism attack. Education and surveillance procedures have been bolstered, and
new detection technologies are being developed (Special
Topic 28.1; see also eTopic 28.3). We will probably never
be fully protected from attack, biological or otherwise, but
recent efforts have improved the situation.

Detecting Emerging
Microbial Diseases

News, whether obtained from traditional sources or Twitter, almost always carries stories of new infectious diseases
cropping up in the world, so-called emerging infectious
diseases. This section discusses the concept of emerging
diseases, how they develop, and how health organizations
detect and track them.

Emerging and Reemerging Pathogens

A world map showing the general locations of emerging and reemerging diseases is shown in Figure 28.27.
A reemerging disease is one thought to be under control
but whose incidence has risen. For example, the incidence
rate of tuberculosis dropped sharply in the 1950s, but the
number of cases since 1980 has increased just as dramatically. Tuberculosis is a reemerging disease. The trigger for
its reemergence was the AIDS pandemic. Immunocompromised AIDS patients are highly susceptible to infection by
many organisms, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
M. tuberculosis is also reemerging among non-AIDS
patients, owing to the development of drug-resistant
strains. Drug resistance in M. tuberculosis developed largely
because of noncompliance on the part of patients in completing their full courses of antibiotic treatment. Treatment
usually involves three or more antibiotics to reduce the risk
that resistance to any one drug will develop. Many patients
failed to take all three drugs simultaneously, allowing the
organism to develop resistance to one drug at a time, until
it became resistant to all of them. These highly drug-resistant strains are almost impossible to kill. The link between
noncompliance and the development of drug resistance is
the primary reason for the current requirement that tuberculosis patients be in the presence of a medical staff member when taking the multiple antibiotics prescribed.
As described in Section 28.3, highly infectious diseases
are identified using aggressive epidemiological surveillance. Communication among local, national, and world
health organizations is critical and helped expose the rise
in tuberculosis. To see for yourself how emerging diseases

MEDICINE AND IMMUNOLOGY

SPECIAL TOPIC 28.1** What’s Blowing in the Wind?
In April 1979, workers at a secret Soviet biological weapons
facility neglected to replace a filter in a laboratory ventilation
system, and a cloud of highly weaponized Bacillus anthracis
spores quickly spewed into the air outside. The deadly plume
drifted downwind, infecting humans and cattle across a wide
area. The resulting anthrax outbreak ultimately killed more
than 64 people. Had a rapid pathogen detection system been
available and deployed at the facility, all those lives could have
been saved. Unfortunately, 30 years ago such technology was
only the stuff of science fiction. Today, that technology exists
in small, portable forms.
Several multipathogen molecular detection platforms have
been developed. Some involve machines that detect antigenantibody interactions; others use automated PCR to amplify
specific pathogen genes and detect the products through
hybridization to immobilized oligonucleotides. The wet chemistries for all of these detection systems are carried out in a
roughly 2-inch square called lab-on-a-chip.
An interesting addition to the field of quick pathogen detection is the BioFlash-E sensor. Initially called PANTHER (Pathogen Analyzer for Threatening Environmental Releases), the
device was developed in 2008. BioFlash-E can detect and
identify a pathogen in as little as 3 minutes—significantly faster
than traditional methods requiring isolation and growth of the
pathogen (which can take 48 hours or longer). The sensor
(Fig. 1A) uses a cell-based technology called CANARY (Cellular
Analysis and Notification of Antigen Risks and Yields) that can
detect as few as a dozen particles of a pathogen per liter of air.
Currently, it can detect 24 pathogens, including the potential
bioterrorism agents of anthrax, plague, smallpox, and tularemia.
The device uses an array of B cells, each displaying antibodies specific to a particular bacterium or virus. The cells

are monitored, search the Internet for a website called
ProMED-mail. There you will find daily reports posted
from around the world that describe new outbreaks of
infectious diseases.
A posting on May 19, 2016, for example, reports 60 cases,
including 10 deaths, of hemorrhagic fever syndrome (symptoms of unexpected bleeding, fever, fatigue, and vomiting)
from South Sudan in Africa. Laboratory tests performed
thus far have eliminated a variety of viruses, including Ebola
and Marburg, that can cause these symptoms. Could this
be the leading edge of a new, deadly epidemic? Hindsight,
of course, is 20/20. A March 22, 2014, ProMED report
from Guinea in Africa described an outbreak of a disease
with similar symptoms that killed 60 people. A WHO laboratory had just identified it as Ebola. In the post, a physician working with the medical charity Doctors Without

are engineered to emit photons of light when they detect
their target pathogen. More specifically, the B cells have been
bioengineered to express the gene that encodes aequorin, a
calcium-sensitive bioluminescent protein. When a pathogen
surface antigen cross-links the appropriate B-cell surface
antibodies, a signal transduction cascade produces a rapid
influx of calcium (Fig. 1B). Aequorin in the B cell will luminesce within seconds of calcium influx, and the light emitted
is detected by a photon detector. The device then displays a
list of any pathogens found.
Quick pathogen detection technologies are constantly
being improved in the effort to defend against bioterrorism. Small, quick pathogen detection devices could be used
in buildings, subways, and other public areas. Eventually,
such technology is expected to supplant the classical clinical
microbiology practices that require growth of the microbe to
achieve identification. There is hope, for example, that such
devices could be used on farms or in food-processing plants
to test for contamination by E. coli, Salmonella, or other foodborne pathogens. Another potential application is in medical diagnostics, where the technology could be used to test
patient samples, giving rapid results without having to send
samples to a laboratory. Wherever it is used, successful quick
pathogen detection should provide the clinician with better
information to quickly prescribe the appropriate course of
treatment.

RESEARCH QUESTION
The research article referenced below describes a method of
biothreat detection that combines PCR with mass spectrometry (see Section 28.2). Why might this coupled technology
be superior for detecting biowarfare agents as compared to

Borders was quoted as saying: “The quicker we can contain this the fewer cases we’ll have, then the smaller the
scale of the epidemic. That’s the idea of going in as strong
as we can early on.” We now know that this report represented the leading edge of the horrific Ebola epidemic that
ravaged West Africa. As a fledgling microbiologist, tracking these ProMED reports allows you to see epidemics and
new diseases emerge almost in real time.

Tracking an Emerging Disease

Sometimes world and national health organizations quickly
and efficiently identify and contain outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, as was the case in 2003 with severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (eTopic 28.4). In other
instances, outbreaks take more time to contain, such as the
2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, described earlier. Agencies can also face difficulties in clearly identifying the causative
agent of an outbreak, as in the current 2015–16 Zika virus
outbreak in Brazil. The unfolding Zika virus story provides
an instructive example of how new diseases are identified.

fever, a fiery red rash, and pain in her joints. Her symptoms
went away within a few days, and she went about her life,
oblivious to what was to come. Five months later, in September 2015, she delivered her baby and immediately knew from
the look on the obstetrician’s face that something was terribly
wrong. Her son had an abnormally small head and incomplete brain development—something called microcephaly.
The young mother was devastated.
In August 2015, Dr. Vanessa van der Linden, a neurologist
in Recife, started noticing an increasing number of newborns with microcephaly (Fig. 28.28). Normally, months
would pass without her seeing a single case. Now there were
three or four in a single day. Using serological tests, she
ruled out the usual suspects, such as rubella (German measles) and toxoplasmosis. Imaging studies, however, revealed

unusual patterns of calcification in the affected brains (a
possible sign of virus-induced necrosis). Vanessa knew
something odd was going on. Then her mother called.
Vanessa’s mother, Dr. Ana van der Linden, a neuropediatrician in another Recife hospital told her daughter that
she had seen seven babies with microcephaly in just one
day, and that some of the mothers remembered having a
rash early during pregnancy. Could there be an infectious
cause to these birth defects? In October, Vanessa alerted
the state health secretary about the spike in microcephaly

cases. This was the first step in the epidemiological journey
linking Zika virus, the cause of a normally benign, mosquito-transmitted disease in adults, to the development of
microcephaly in Zika virus–infected fetal brains.
As the number of microcephaly cases grew, suspicion by
public health officials initially fell on dengue virus, in part
because the symptoms of Zika fever resemble those of dengue fever and because prior to 2014, Zika virus infections
were rare in Brazil. Dengue virus was far more common
and considered the most likely cause of the women’s symptoms. Consequently, individuals who actually had Zika
fever were not screened for Zika virus; they were screened
by ELISA for anti–dengue virus antibodies. Unfortunately,
patient antibodies to Zika virus can cross-react with dengue
virus antigen, so a person infected with Zika can appear to
test positive for dengue (see the discussion of test specificity
in Section 28.2). This technical problem slowed efforts to
identify Zika virus as the cause of the women’s symptoms
and obscured the virus’s connection to the alarming rise
in newborn microcephaly. Today, there are more specific
RT-qPCR tests and virus isolations to confirm Zika virus
diagnoses.
Both Zika and dengue viruses have positive-sense RNA
genomes and are members of the Flaviviridae family of
viruses. West Nile virus, mentioned earlier, is also a member of this family. Zika, dengue, and West Nile viruses

CHAPTER 28

are transmitted to humans by Aedes mosquito vectors in
person-to-person or animal-to-human transmission cycles.
West Nile virus uses birds as natural reservoirs, whereas
Zika and dengue viruses infect primarily human and nonhuman primates. There are also some reports of sexual
transmission of Zika virus in areas devoid of the Aedes
mosquito vectors. As of July 2016, Zika virus was not considered endemic in the United States, even though there
are people living in the United States infected with Zika,
including 200–300 pregnant women initially infected elsewhere in the world.
How does a viral pathogen become endemic in a country? In order for Zika, and many other mosquito-borne
viruses, to become endemic in a new location, four things
must happen:
1. The mosquito vector must already be present in the
area.
2. A person infected in an endemic area such as Brazil
must travel to the nonendemic area.
3. A local mosquito must bite the infected traveler and
transmit the virus to another victim.
4. Finally, the virus must also be transmitted to an animal
reservoir that can maintain the virus within a geographical area. For example, West Nile virus, introduced into
the United States in 1999, quickly infected the native
bird population and is now transmitted from birds to
humans by mosquito.
As of September 2016, Zika virus had fulfilled three of
the four criteria in the United States. The Aedes mosquito
vector inhabits areas of at least 30 states, stretching from
California through the southern and northeastern states.
There are hundreds of people infected with Zika virus
now living in the United States. The virus has also been
introduced into the native mosquito population around
Miami, and the infected mosquitoes have transmitted the
Zika virus to several humans in the area. Fortunately, the
last requirement, finding a native animal host reservoir, is
thought to be unlikely. Zika virus is not known to infect
birds or animals other than nonhuman primates native to
much of South America and the Caribbean but not to the
United States.
How did Zika virus get to Brazil? Zika virus was previously recognized in Africa and Asia as causing mild disease
but had never been reported in Brazil. Epidemiologists have
used next-generation DNA sequencing of Brazilian Zika
virus isolates to explore its origin. The data indicate that the
Brazilian strain originated from an Asian strain that circulated in French Polynesia in 2013, but the event that introduced the Asian virus into Brazil is unclear. Regardless of
how it got there, once the virus was introduced, native mosquitoes fed on the carrier(s), became infected and began
transmitting the virus throughout the country. The disease

is now endemic to Brazil. There is no treatment for Zika
fever, although furious efforts are under way to develop a
vaccine. At the moment, the only protection against Zika
is to prevent infection by avoiding or eradicating the Aedes
mosquitoes.
So, have Koch’s postulates been fulfilled? Does Zika
virus infection of the mother lead to transplacental transmission of the virus to the fetus? And does virus replication interfere with fetal brain development? Evidence of
the virus has been found in the blood of mothers who have
delivered babies with microcephaly, and also in umbilical cord blood. The virus itself has been isolated from the
brains of fetuses who died from microcephaly (see the
Current Research Highlight in Chapter 26). Other studies have recapitulated the neurotropic nature of the virus
and indicate that Zika virus can interfere with neurogenesis during human brain development. In sum, the evidence
of a link is convincing but not yet ironclad. More epidemiological studies must be conducted to unequivocally prove
the link.
As of this writing, at least 1,000 babies in Brazil have
been born with microcephaly and other birth defects
linked to Zika virus. But it is important to point out that
despite the fear Zika virus brings to pregnant women, the
vast majority of confirmed Zika virus–infected pregnant
women deliver healthy babies. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) are carefully monitoring the spread of
Zika virus throughout the Americas by intensively screening mosquitoes.

Technology Helps New Infectious
Agents Emerge and Spread

Despite all we know of microbes and despite the many ways
we have to combat microbial diseases, our species, for all its
cleverness, still lives at the mercy of the microbe. Lyme disease, MRSA, SARS, MERS-CoV, Ebola, E. coli O157:H7,
HIV, “flesh-eating” streptococci, hantavirus, swine flu—
all of these and many other new diseases and pathogens
have emerged over the last 30 years. Worse yet, forgotten
scourges, such as tuberculosis, have reappeared. Yet in the
1970s, medical science was claiming victory over infectious
disease. What happened?
Part of the equation has been progress itself. Travel by
jet, the use of blood banks, and suburban sprawl have all
opened new avenues of infection. The spread of Zika virus
from Africa to Asia and then the Americas is but one example. People unwittingly infected by a new disease in Asia
or Africa can, traveling by jet, take the pathogen to any
other country in the world within hours. A person may not
even show symptoms until days or weeks after the trip. This
means that diseases can spread faster and farther than ever

before. In addition, newly emerged blood-borne pathogens
can spread by transfusion. This was a major problem with
HIV before an accurate blood test was developed to screen
all donated blood.
Although human encroachments into the tropical rain
forests have often been blamed for the emergence of new
pathogens, one need go no farther than the Connecticut
woodlands to find such developments. Borrelia burgdorferi, the spirochete that causes Lyme disease, lives on deer
and white-footed mice and is passed between these hosts
by the deer tick (see Fig. 26.23)—an infection cycle that
has been going on for years. Humans crossed paths with
these animals long before the disease erupted in our communities. Why have we suddenly become susceptible? The
answer appears to be suburban development. In the wild,
foxes and bobcats hunt the mice that carry the Lyme agent.
These predators disappear as developers clear land and
build roads and houses, leaving the infected mice and ticks
to proliferate. Humans in these developed areas are more
likely to be bitten by an infected tick and contract the disease than in prior decades. Luckily, many diseases that successfully leap from animals to humans find the new host to
be a dead end, unable to spread the disease to others.
There are numerous examples in which technology and
progress have had the unintended consequence of breeding
disease. Here are just a few:
■

Mad cow disease. Modern farming practices (North
America and Europe) of feeding livestock the remains
of other animals help spread transmissible spongiform
encephalopathies, similar to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease,
associated with prions. Because the prion is infectious,
the brain matter from one case of mad cow disease could
end up infecting hundreds of other cattle, which in turn
increases the chance that the disease could spread to
humans.

■

Lyme disease. Suburban development in the northeastern United States destroys predators of the mice that
carry Borrelia burgdorferi.

■

Hepatitis C. Transfusions and transplants spread this
blood-borne disease.

■

Influenza. Live poultry markets in Asia serve as breeding grounds for avian flu viruses that can jump to
humans.

■

Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (for example, E. coli
O157:H7). Modern meat-processing plants can accidentally grind trace amounts of these acid-resistant, fecal
organisms into beef while making hamburger.

Natural environmental events can also trigger upsurges
in the incidence of unusual diseases. For example, an
unprecedented outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary disease

occurred in 1993 in the Four Corners area of the Southwest, where Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, and Utah
meet, when rain led to greater-than-normal increases in
plant and animal numbers. The resulting tenfold increase in
deer mice, which carries the virus, made it more likely that
infected mice and humans would come in contact. A more
recent outbreak of hantavirus occurred among campers at
Yosemite National Park in 2012.

Climate Change Influences
Emerging Diseases

The world’s climate has been changing slowly but significantly over the last 50 years—largely as a result of humans
pumping enormous amounts of greenhouse gases, such as
carbon dioxide and methane, into the atmosphere. Greenhouse gases trapping heat in the atmosphere have caused the
world’s average yearly temperature to rise over 1.5°F since
1970. Effects of global warming on climate, depending on
where you live, are evident as disappearing glaciers, increasing sea levels, mounting ferocity of hurricanes and tornadoes,
extended droughts, increased rainfall (floods), dust storms,
and heat waves. These climate changes are bad enough, but
they can also affect the epidemiology of infectious disease.
Rising air temperatures, for example, can extend the habitat of mosquito and tick vectors to higher mountain elevations and wider latitudes. The result is that Zika virus,
dengue virus, and Plasmodium (the protozoan cause of
malaria), among other infectious agents, have increased their
geographic range. Mathematical simulations predict that
the area populated by Anopheles mosquito vectors that carry
malaria will increase between 16% and 49% by 2030, depending on the vector. Extending a pathogen’s range can bring it
into contact with novel groups of hosts, possibly establishing
new vector-pathogen transmission cycles or a situation that
promotes pathogen evolution (such as influenza). Warmer
temperatures can also accelerate host-parasite cycles that will
further increase the incidence and prevalence of infections.
Increased rain and flooding promote the breeding of
mosquito vectors that transmit disease—a situation that
will worsen with climate change. Floods can also accelerate
the spread of diarrheal diseases such as cholera when sanitation systems fail. As these events increase, so, too, will
infectious disease.
The Arctic is particularly sensitive to climate change.
It is home to diverse populations of plants, animals, and
people. Approximately 10 million people live within the
Arctic circle, a geographic area that encompasses parts of
nine countries, including Canada and the United States.
The Arctic has warmed twice as much as the global average of other parts of the world and is becoming increasingly fragile. The associated health risks for humans and
animals include potential changes in pathogen and vector

CHAPTER 28

demographics that can affect disease patterns, degradation
in the quality and availability of both drinking water and
food, and changes in animal and plant species health.
Climate change will continue to create opportunities for
some pathogens and may even limit the transmission of others. To stay ahead of these evolving infections, surveillance
programs capable of detecting pathogen or disease emergence
are essential. Make no mistake: Together, the effect of climate
change on infectious diseases and the rise in antibiotic-resistant microbes pose a serious threat to the living world.

The One Health Initiative

We have provided numerous examples of how the natural
environment can harbor pathogens and foster the emergence of new ones. Knowledge that pathogens have reservoirs in animals, arthropods, and plants has given rise to a
new collaborative effort among clinicians, scientists, veterinarians, and ecologists called the One Health Initiative. The
goal of the One Health Initiative is to control human health
through animal health, and vice versa. For example, vaccinating wild rodents could decrease Lyme disease in humans.
The initiative includes plant pathology because some bacteria
are pathogens of both plants and humans (for example, Pantoea agglomerans, formerly Enterobacter agglomerans). In
addition, some enteric bacteria can live within a plant vascular system (for example, E. coli, Klebsiella, and Salmonella).

ditches close to the spinach fields in the area. Scientists
pondering these facts within the One Health framework
deduced that cattle harboring the E. coli had defecated in
a field, thereby contaminating wild hogs. The wild hogs,
by running through the spinach fields, had contaminated
those fields with their feces, and the irrigation water had
then swept the pathogen into the plant vasculature.
Only by integrating our knowledge of the environment
and ecology could this investigation be completely understood and appropriate intervention and prevention strategies implemented. This outbreak exemplifies the fact that
human health and animal health are inextricably linked
and that a holistic approach is needed to understand, protect, and promote the health of all species.
Stopping zoonotic diseases. A more recent example of

the One Health approach is being carried out in the Ruaha
region of Tanzania, Africa—a sprawling, wild area with scattered small villages and a rich wildlife. Thousands of children
and adults in underdeveloped countries such as Tanzania die
every day from diseases arising from the human-animal-environment interface. People in these areas often live in close
contact with wild and domestic animals and are brought
even closer as water becomes scarcer (Fig. 28.29). Sharing
the same water sources for drinking, washing, and swimming facilitates zoonotic disease transmission to humans.

ciplinary collaboration resulted in better understanding of
an infectious outbreak occurred in 2006 when approximately 200 people in 26 states were diagnosed with a particularly virulent case of E. coli O157:H7. Nearly half of
the cases were hospitalized, and many suffered from hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS, kidney failure described in
Section 26.4). The source of the infection was contaminated spinach traced to the Salinas Valley of California. It
turned out the organisms were contained within the vascular system of the spinach, so washing the spinach would
not remove the pathogen. Had this outbreak been viewed
through only the narrow lens of human health, efforts
would have focused on morbidity, mortality, outbreak
investigation, laboratory diagnosis, and clinical treatment.
The origin of the disease would have remained a mystery.
Working together, epidemiologists and veterinarians
found a genetically identical organism in cattle close to
where the spinach was produced and in wild hogs that ran
through the same fields. Ecologists and hydrologists understood that the groundwater and surface water in this region
were being mixed because of a drought followed by heavy
rains, and that irrigation systems were strained in the effort
to keep up with intensified agricultural production. Eventually, the same E. coli strain was found in one of the water
